										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/">shared his aspirations</a> last year to turn the startup he co-founded in 2017 into one of the world’s major battery recycling companies. Now, the former Tesla co-founder and CTO has the money to accelerate those plans.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials said Wednesday it raised $700 million from high-profile institutional investors and venture firms, providing the capital needed to expand its existing operations well beyond its Carson City, Nevada home base to locations throughout North America and even into Europe.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Fidelity. Previous investors Capricorn&#8217;s Technology Impact Fund, Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund returned to put more capital into Redwood. Valor Equity Partners, Emerson Collective, and Franklin Templeton also participated, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood previously raised $40 million in a Series B and some seed money, which brings its total raise under $800 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round. Redwood declined to comment on the figure.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel says, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Redwood recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC&#8217;s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our view, the need for these materials will grow exponentially over time as we enter the era of de-carbonization,&#8221; Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund said in a statement, adding that &#8220;Redwood is well-positioned to be at the forefront of tackling this emerging and critically important problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straubel sees a bottleneck coming as the whole supply chain seeks to access critical materials. That will affect the growth rate and challenge automakers like Ford, GM and Volkswagen that have laid out ambitious plans to electrify their portfolios.</p>
<p>That problem is likely to compound as the number of automakers going down the electric path grows. Last week, Mercedes-Benz said it will spend €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade. The German automaker determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</p>
<p>Straubel said it&#8217;s time for Redwood to scale more aggressively.</p>
<p>Those plans were already well underway even before it closed the $700 million round, Straubel noted. The company announced in June it had purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. Redwood now has some operations at the site.</p>
<p>Redwood is also in the process of nearly tripling the size of its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada. The new 400,000. addition onto the recycling facility is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To support the growth, Redwood started hiring more employees with plans to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years. Redwood employs more than 130 people today.</p>
<p>The company has expanded in others ways as well, including the launch of a program that allows consumers to send in their personal electronics such as smartphones to be recycled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This additional equity to some extent helps us finish all those things, but it&#8217;s not really the primary purpose for all of it,&#8221; Straubel said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot is tackling affordable healthcare with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a compliment to traditional health insurance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Affordable healthcare continues to be a major problem in the U.S., with roughly 30 million people without comprehensive healthcare and high medical costs causing many to go into debt. <a href="https://www.getspot.com/">Spot</a> is tackling this issue with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a complement to traditional health insurance.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Austin, the company raised $15 million in equity and $2.5 million in debt in a round of seed funding led by GreatPoint Ventures, with participation from Montage Ventures, Mutual of Omaha, MS&amp;AD and Silverton Partners.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came from a conversation founder Maria Goy and Matt Randall had back in 2018. Randall is married to Goy’s best friend, and one night, they started talking about Goy’s job at the time, in insurance at New York Life, and how there needed to be a product that provided affordable insurance. That led to a discussion about how to also have healthcare that was accessible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every major market was disrupted by some change of distribution, like Netflix and Airbnb,” Goy told TechCrunch. “We are setting the foundation to drive change and the distribution of insurance.”</p>
<p>Spot’s business model takes a holistic approach by providing customized injury insurance policies through both direct-to-consumer and strategic partnerships with companies and organizations. For example, one of the company’s first partners was the Austin Marathon, selling one-time injury policies to the participants. Randall wasn‘t sure if people would buy them, but they ended up selling over 1,100 policies.</p>
<p>That led to applying the same idea across youth sports, ski resorts and cycling organizations. It now has over a dozen partners, including USA Cycling, Powder Mountain, USA BMX, National Ski Patrol and athleteReg, and covers tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>The policies start at $25 and work like a monthly subscription. Family plans are also available. Spot covers up to $20,000 each time the customer is injured. The company will also coordinate with any existing healthcare insurance. Customers can use any licensed physician, hospital or urgent care clinic.</p>
<p>Spot has grown 800% in policies from last year and 300% in partnerships, including bringing on Mutual of Omaha. Spot is the first startup the insurance giant has invested in, and “having them alongside Maria is beyond a powerhouse team to say the least,” Randall said.</p>
<p>The company’s policies are available in 42 states via the DTC model and nationwide on group coverage, Goy said. The new funding round will be used to triple Spot’s team of 25, go after new partnerships and develop a go-to-market strategy. Randall also plans to raise a Series A round in the next nine months.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on bringing additional products that fill in holes and gaps in insurance and provide more education to the market,” Goy added. “We are getting requests for alternative coverage. For example, people would rather have acupuncture instead of surgery, which is not easy for a typical policy. Ultimately, our big mission is how to create a community within our customers and drive engagement.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Mike McCormick, principal at GreatPoint Ventures, will join Spot’s board of directors. He said in an interview that his firm is on the lookout for things that make healthcare better, including companies rooted in rethinking how to keep people well.</p>
<p>Spending much of his time in both healthcare and insurtech, McCormick wanted to find an answer to the problem of how the U.S. is spending so much money, on a per capita basis, and getting what he called “meh results.”</p>
<p>There are also the issues of most care being fee-for-service, and insurance for most people being attached to employment, while high deductibles have become a big feature, he said. He likes Spot because it is offering a product, for example, to someone young who is unlikely to get diabetes or cancer soon, but could incur $10,000 in medical costs breaking a leg skiing.</p>
<p>“What Spot is doing for the underinsured and uninsured makes sense,” McCormick added. “Maria and Matt are incredible people building an incredible company with growth and product-market fit. In terms of the partnership and direct-to-consumer models, they could build either one into a $10 billion company and both will work.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A slew of launch startups have emerged in recent years to help meet growing demand from satellite providers, biotech companies and others looking to send payload to space. One such startup is Germany’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/">Isar Aerospace Technologies</a>, which is focused on building orbital launch vehicles designed to carry up to 1,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The startup made headlines last December – including here at TechCrunch – for scoring a $91 million Series B, the largest round to date in the European space launch scene. Now the company says it has raised an additional $75 million in a Series B extension, bringing the total round to over $165 million.</p>
<p>The extension round was led by HV Capital, Porsche SE and banking group Lombard Odier. Existing investors Earlybird Venture Capital, Lakestar, Vsquared Ventures, Apeiron Investment Group and UVC Partners also participated, with Earlybird subscribing the largest amount. Earlybird and Airbus Ventures led Isar’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/article.php?id=2019121001">$17 million Series A</a> in December 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Participation by Porsche SE – a major shareholder of Volkswagen – is particularly interesting as it signals growing interest from established mobility investors in connectivity and space-enabled technologies.</p>
<p>“As an investor focusing on mobility and industrial technology, we are convinced that cost-effective and flexible access to space will be a key enabler for innovations in traditional industries as well as for new and disruptive technologies and business models,” Porsche SE executive board member Lutz Meschke said in a statement. “Therefore, we are excited to back Isar Aerospace on its way to become the leading European small-launcher and to meet the increasing appetite for launch services.”</p>

<p>The funding will likely provide a significant boost for continued development and manufacturing as the company nears its planned first test flight in 2022.</p>
<p>Isar began production of its inaugural launch vehicle, the Spectrum rocket, this year. Spectrum is a two-stage vehicle that’s designed for lightweight delivery to low Earth orbit. The idea is to create a launcher that can move quickly and at a low cost to small satellite companies. Isar is aiming to conduct engine tests in Kiruna, Sweden, and launch operations in nearby Andøya, Norway, thanks to a 20-year agreement with Andøya Space for exclusive access to one of its launch pads. Notably, Isar has already secured its first paying customer, Airbus Defence and Space, and said in a statement that it plans on announcing more contracts soon.</p>
<p>The startup was spun out of Munich Technical University, where co-founders Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl were studying engineering. While many of the new wave of launch companies are based in the United States, Isar is leading a parallel wave in Germany.</p>
<p>“A competitive and diverse space ecosystem will be crucial for humanity in the decades to come,” Isar CEO Daniel Metzler said in a statement. “We are convinced that European cooperation, a level-playing field for all players, and a demand-driven approach will provide customers with access to different and internationally competitive launch capabilities for a broad spectrum of payloads. The US has shown that cornerstone contracts based on demand – instead of political parameters – are preparing the ground for innovation and growth in the space sector.”</p>

<p>Mads Fosselius, founder and CEO of Dixa said: “For today’s customers, channels have ceased to matter. The way they engage now is holistically blended into what is called ‘multiexperience’. This is how we’re empowering brands to continuously stay true to their values.</p>
<p>Tom Hussey, Vice President in General Atlantic’s Technology sector focused on B2B software added: “Customer service software is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from disjointed, transactional approaches towards longitudinal, conversational engagement. Dixa has helped to define and lead this multiexperience approach.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.medrhythms.com/">MedRhythms</a> secured $25 million in Series B funding to advance its digital therapy platform aimed at measuring and improving someone’s ability to walk after they have experienced a neurologic injury or disease.</p>
<p>Morningside Ventures and Advantage Capital co-led the round, with participation from existing investor Werth Family Investment Associates, to give the Portland, Maine-based company $31 million in funding to date.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Brian Harris was a neurologic music fellow at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, treating people with stroke and brain deficits with music. He began getting questions from patients and families on how they could access similar care outside of the hospital. Not seeing a suitable alternative, he started MedRhythms with entrepreneur Owen McCarthy in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s platform uses sensors, music and software, along with an evidence-based intervention called “rhythmic auditory stimulation,” to target the neural circuitry that controls movement. The technology taps into “entrainment,” a neurologic process in which the auditory and motor systems of the brain are coupled in synchrony with an external rhythmic cue, which over time, can lead to improved walking functionalities.</p>
<p>“There is no other stimulus that engages the brain like music does,” Harris said. “When someone is engaging in music, it aids in neuroplasticity to create new connections and strengthen old ones. Neuroplasticity is how we can learn new things or why people with brain deficits can improve.”</p>

<p>A year ago, MedRhythms’ digital therapeutic product received Breakthrough Device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat chronic walking deficits resulting from a stroke. It is the first in the company’s pipeline, which is also looking at using music to treat neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, acute stroke and multiple sclerosis. To that effect, it is participating in a neuroimaging study with Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>Harris intends to use the proceeds from the Series B funding to get the product to market, expand the team and the treatment pipeline. The company is preparing for submission to the FDA so it can do a commercial launch of the technology and begin clinical trials.</p>
<p>Stephen Bruso, investment partner at Morningside, said he has known the team at MedRhythms for a year. The firm is active in the digital health space and has followed the company closely since then.</p>
<p>COVID served to fundamentally shift healthcare in how to deliver care. The hospital and clinic models were robust, but resistant to change until the pandemic forced care to telemedicine visits at home, he said. It also forced innovation on the industry, and at-home therapy is an area where Bruso expects to see improvement in both patient compliance and recovery, and MedRhythms is capitalizing on that trend of shifting care to the home.</p>
<p>What intrigued the firm for the last couple of months was the idea of affecting the brain via non-pharmaceutical needs.</p>
<p>“MedRhythms using musical intervention to drive changes and improvements in neurologics is compelling,” Bruso added. “Emotional memory is tied to music. Its use provides a richer experience than taking a drug, and the company exists to tap into that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.algolia.com">Algolia</a> has raised a $150 million Series D funding round at a post-money valuation of $2.25 billion. Compared to the Series C round from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/algolia-finds-110m-from-accel-and-salesforce-for-its-search-as-a-service-used-by-slack-twitch-and-8k-others/">October 2019</a>, the company’s valuation has more than quadrupled. It means that Algolia is now a unicorn with a valuation above $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its search-as-a-service product. It lets you integrate real-time search in your app or website using a developer-friendly API. Using an Algolia-powered search feature feels like using Spotlight on a Mac. Results load with each keystroke and appear in just a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>The company now has over 10,000 customers, including some big names, such as Slack, Stripe, Medium, Zendesk and Lacoste. Right now, the company handles over 1.5 trillion search queries per year — that’s a 1,500,000,000,000 if you want to see all the zeros.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lone Pine Capital is leading today’s funding round. Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, STEADFAST Capital Ventures, Glynn Capital and Twilio also participated in the round. But that’s not all, some existing investors also put more money on the table, such as Accel, Salesforce Ventures, DAG, Owl Rock and World Innovation Lab.</p>
<p>While the company doesn’t share revenue numbers directly, Algolia says that its annual recurring revenue has increased by 180% year over year.</p>
<p>“The future is API-first – a reality underscored by the growth seen by Twilio, Stripe, Algolia and others in the API economy. A huge part of our success has, and will continue to be, our relentless focus on developers with our PLG strategy — enabling them to build search into their websites and apps, so they create the most relevant and dynamic digital experiences.” Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon said in a statement. “And we’re excited to continue to solve customers&#39; problems as we continue to expand beyond search with Algolia Recommend and Predict.”</p>
<p>In addition to its search API, Algolia has expanded to other real-time APIs. For instance, you can provide real-time product recommendations on your e-commerce website with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/products/recommendations/">Algolia Recommend</a>. This is part of a strategy to diversify the company’s product offering.</p>
<p>In particular, the company is now trying to analyze the visitor’s intent to predict whether they’re likely to purchase something on not. Companies can then leverage that info to refresh content dynamically, send a push notification, display a special offer, etc.</p>
<p>Originally founded in France, the company has grown tremendously over the past few years. Algolia is now a big enterprise-focused company with a solid business. Last year, its co-founder and CEO Nicolas Dessaigne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/algolia-gets-a-new-ceo-as-founder-steps-down/">decided</a> to transition to a non-operational role.</p>
<p>And the company has recruited quite a few senior executives over the past 18 months — Michelle Adams (chief revenue officer, formerly of Dropbox), Carlton Baab (chief financial officer, formerly of Alfresco), Piyush Patel (chief business development officer, formerly of Capgemini), Jim Schattin (chief customer officer, formerly of Alteryx), Jason McClelland (chief marketing officer, formerly of Salesforce and Adobe) and Bharat Guruprakash (chief product officer, formerly of Twilio).</p>
<p>As you can see, it’s a long list of talented people, which means that Algolia is focused on building a long-term company instead of building cool technology and optimizing for an acquisition. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn about an IPO down the road.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down over 3,000 available plans into a handful of best choices based on their care requirements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employers typically offer three options for healthcare insurance. When it&#8217;s time to switch to Medicare, particularly Medicare Advantage, there are over <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2021-spotlight-first-look/">3,500 plans available</a> nationwide, and an average of 30 plans someone can choose from in their particular area. Connie Health is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down those 3,000 plans into a handful of best choices based on care requirements.</p>
<p>The company’s three co-founders, Oded Eran, CEO, David Luna, chief revenue officer, and Michael Scopa, chief growth officer, saw this problem firsthand as executives at primary care company Iora Health, which is <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/one-medical-to-acquire-iora-health-2-1b-all-stock-deal">being acquired by OneMedical</a> for $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>They started their company in 2019 to develop a Medicare concierge service to assist seniors in easily navigating through those 30 plans to find the right one for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We were coming from the provider side and understood that though healthcare is local, people don’t know the difference in hospitals or the ins and outs of local networks,” Eran told TechCrunch. “Seniors need trust there, and when there are local advisers to meet over the phone or at home, you gain that trust.”</p>
<p>The Boston-based company announced Wednesday it raised $13 million in Series A funding led by Khosla Ventures and Pittango Healthtech to give it a total of $16 million in funding. The company raised $3 million in a seed round back in January 2020, also led by Khosla. The seed and Series A rounds also saw participation by AbstractVentures, Dynamic Loop Capital, Arkitekt Ventures, as well as a group of angel investors, including Hippo Insurance CEO Assaf Wand and Flatiron Health founders Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182660" style="width: 982px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182660" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png" alt="" width="972" height="608" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182660" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Connie Health</p></div></p>
<p>With 55 million Medicare consumers benefiting from major innovation in Medicare Advantage and value-based care, Kaul saw a large market that was being disrupted by Connie Health. He was especially impressed with the team Eran built and how the company was able to launch during the pandemic and stay nimble.</p>
<p>“The Medicare Advantage space is rich and will continue to grow,” Kaul added. “Technology has not played a big role here, and Oded is going to bring technology in to make the market more efficient.”</p>
<p>Medicare Advantage is the private market part of the insurance program. Eran said the government is trying to drive competition and innovation, so there are a lot of new players coming in to create more plan options, more nuances and to help manage costs better. On the consumer level, this creates a lot of confusion, he added. Potential customers have a hard time making decisions on the latest and greatest options, so they tend to stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>That’s where Connie Health comes in. The company’s technology takes into account the providers someone sees, the medications they are on and the benefits they would like to have, feed those into its model, and based on that, sifts through the thousands of plans available and recommends the best fits.</p>
<p>Four months ago, Connie Health kicked off its consumer platform in Arizona, and with the new investment, also began operating in Texas. Over the next year, Eran expects to move into Illinois, where he is seeing big demographic changes as a lot of people are moving into Medicare and other states. The new funding will also enable the company to branch off to other insurance products.</p>
<p>Within those states, the company’s footprint grew to seven markets, and its local agent base grew 15 times.</p>
<p>“We are going to democratize access to the local agents to help people make these often tough decisions and find healthcare that they deserve and have paid for all of their working life,” Eran said. “We are taking this market-by-market approach because healthcare is in the community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four high-profile Indian entrepreneurs who are among those who kickstarted India’s SaaS journey, building and helping startups scale and win customers globally and also backed about 100 such firms, are ready for their next phase of participation in the country’s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>The group &#8212; Girish Mathrubootham of Freshworks, Manav Garg of Eka Corporation, Shubham Gupta, formerly with investment firm Matrix, and Avinash Raghava, formerly with Nasscom, iSPIRT and SaaSBOOMi &#8212; said on Wednesday it has created a venture capital fund, called Together Fund, with an initial corpus of $85 million to back young Indian startups operating in the software-as-a-service space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.together.fund">Together Fund</a> is looking to back between 20 to 25 startups at Pre-seed to Series B stages. The firm’s check size will range between $250,000 to $3 million, said Garg in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet the CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/03/mathrubootham-garg-vc-hat-with-80-mn-saas-fund/">first reported</a> about the fund&#8217;s formation earlier this year and cited an investor who said that Together is likely to attract all good SaaS deals because of its founding team and problem statement.</p>
<p>The fund has amassed a network of over 150 startup founders and investors including Krish Subramanian of Chargebee, Nishith Rastogi of Locus, Shashank ND of Practo, and Kunal Shah of CRED. And that underscores the reason why Together Fund was conceived, said Garg. The entire team consists of founders and other operators who have built startups and have expertise around sales strategy and global expansion, he said.</p>
<p>“This is India’s first operator and founder-led fund,” he said. “The idea of creating this fund was to provide great help and opportunities to the founders along with money.”</p>
<p>The creation of the fund &#8212; which counts its founding team among its LPs &#8212; comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital as many high-profile investors double down in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>In the past decade, India’s startup ecosystem has evolved from a space that most Indian families were apprehensive about to one that has witnessed several high-profile exits and many entrepreneurs have marched ahead to work on their second startups.</p>
<p>“Today, Freshworks is a large company with more than 3,800 team members and offices all over the world. But almost eleven years ago, we were just a six-member team operating out of a small garage in Chennai. I didn’t have a gilt-edged resume or family wealth but that never stopped me from dreaming big,” wrote Mathrubootham in a blog post.</p>
<p>“To me, Together is not just a fund, it is a way to pay it forward to the startup community that gave me so much. It is a natural progression of the “pay it forward” initiatives we started with community programs such as PNGrowth, SaaSx and SaaSBOOMi. With Together, we are not just offering capital to founders, we are offering our time and counsel as well,” he added.</p>
<p>The founding team of Together Fund will continue to participate in other industry initiatives, including SaaSBOOMi, an annual flagship conference focused on SaaS startups in India, said Raghava in an interview.</p>
<p>India’s SaaS industry could reach $1 trillion in value and create about half million new jobs by 2030, according to a recent study by SaaSBoomi, consultancy firm McKinsey and industry trade group Nasscom.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch caught up with Contentful's CEO, Steve Sloan (previously of Twilio and Bessemer), and its comms connect, Brian Spittler (previously of Podium), to dig more into its products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> this morning announced a $175 million Series F round of capital, led by Tiger Global, valuing the unicorn at around $3 billion. Contentful, formerly known as a UI-free content management system (headless CMS), now views itself in a broader light. More simply, Contentful provides customers with a service that will deliver images, words, and other content to their applications and websites around the world, quickly.</p>
<p>According to the company, Tidemark and Base10 Advancement Initiative were added to its cap table in the round, which also saw participation from previous investors. Prior to the round that Contentful announced today, its most recent fundraising event was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/contentful-raises-80m-series-e-round-for-its-headless-cms/">an $80 million Series E</a> led by Sapphire Ventures in June 2020.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that that round was raised at a roughly $550 million valuation, while our reporting at the time of the company&#8217;s Series E includes the tidbit that &#8220;a Contentful spokesperson [told TechCrunch] that [the company was] approaching a $1 billion&#8221; valuation. Split the difference and it&#8217;s clear that Contentful&#8217;s new valuation is a multiple of what the company was worth a year ago.</p>
<p>But before we dig into metrics and results &#8212; or really a lack thereof &#8212; let&#8217;s take a minute to chat through Contenful&#8217;s business.</p>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Contentful&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-sloan-213515">Steve Sloan</a> (previously of Twilio and Bessemer), and its comms connect, <a href="https://twitter.com/brianspittler">Brian Spittler</a> (previously of Podium), to dig more into its products.</p>
<p>Sloan explained Contentful by analogy, saying that as Twilio served the communications market and Stripe the payments space, Contentful wants to handle the world&#8217;s digital content. Yes, we&#8217;re talking APIs (application programming interface). Contentful has a handful of core APIs that allow for reading and writing content to its data buckets and making content available at the right time.</p>
<p>In more practical terms, Contentful doesn&#8217;t want to help companies build apps. Other companies are rather good at that. Instead, it wants to help customers&#8217; apps load their in-app content very quickly, regardless of where their users are. You can now better understand the modestly aspirational Stripe and Twilio comparison; Contentful wants to take a piece of a developer&#8217;s workload, in this case delivering digital content to controlled applications, abstract it and deliver the functionality as an API. So as developers could simply use Twilio to make text messages appear around the world without coming to terms with global telephone providers, Contentful customers can avoid having to think about content delivery networks (CDNs) and global bandwidth for their content.</p>
<p>Now that we have a reasonable grasp of what Contentful does, let&#8217;s talk about growth:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not an errant space. Contentful&#8217;s CEO declined to share essentially anything concerning its business growth, aside from that when Contentful raised its Series E it was around an &#8220;inflection point&#8221; for the company. This irked me a little; we <em>know</em> that the company had a good 2020 and likely a good 2021 thus far. Why? Because Tiger didn&#8217;t invest in a $175 million round at a new, higher price for Contentful on the back of mediocre results.</p>
<p>To his credit, Sloan was willing to explain why his company decided to avoid sharing growth information. Per the CEO, when a company discloses pieces of growth data over time, folks will go back when they go public and compare data to claims. And, he added, given that definitions can change, sharing can be more bother than it&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s some truth to this: Some startups will claim profitability, for example, only to gently backpedal and explain that what they meant was really adjusted EBITDA, say, or positive operating cash flow.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is for growth-stage startups to share GAAP-ready data with the media when they want our attention. After all, Contentful is aiming toward an IPO and is probably already learning to get its books in proper order. GAAP results are possible! And to be fair to Contentful, <em>many</em> startups decline to share useful data about their performance when courting media attention, often at the request of their investors; that we journalists of the world have to then deal with <em>other</em> investors complaining to us that the media is too fixated on funding rounds as progress points is a distinct, if closely related, matter.</p>
<p>Why do we think that Contentful is targeting an eventual public debut? Because companies tend not to raise nine figures at 10-figure valuations if they are hoping for a quick exit. The unicorn is now too expensive for anyone but the largest tech companies to buy; ergo it intends to go public. And, yes, we <em>would</em> go back and check claimed results against historical GAAP data in its S-1 if we were able to. That&#8217;s research! And fact-checking!</p>
<p>Gripes aside, Sloan shared employee growth expectations in a broad manner. Contentful is around 600 people today, split between its hubs in Denver, Berlin and San Francisco. Over the next two years, it intends to double (or a bit more than double) that headcount. Pull out your pencils and come up with your own revenue guesses based on that. The correct answer is present-day ARR somewhere between $75 and $75 million. Good luck.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Contentful sells to three main customer buckets, per its CEO: midmarket customers, enterprise customers and venture-backed startups that intend to get big. Given that all of those are either pursuing digital transformation work or are digitally native, we presume that Contentful&#8217;s market will remain fertile for some time. That implies a winsome total addressable market for the company to sell into, implying ample future growth opportunities. Let&#8217;s see what it can get done with $175 million more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to software to help IT manage workers&#8217; devices wherever they happen to be, enterprises have long been spoiled for choice &#8212; a situation that has come in especially handy in the last 18 months, when many offices globally have gone remote and people have logged into their systems from home. But the same can&#8217;t really be said for small and medium enterprises: as with so many other aspects of tech, they&#8217;ve long been overlooked when it comes to building modern IT management solutions tailored to their size and needs.</p>
<p>But there are signs of that changing. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.atera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atera</a> that has been building remote, and low-cost, predictive IT management solutions specifically for organizations with less than 1,000 employees, is announcing a funding round of $77 million &#8212; a sign of the demand in the market, and Atera&#8217;s own success in addressing it. The investment values Atera at $500 million, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based startup has amassed some 7,000 customers to date, managing millions of endpoints &#8212; computers and other devices connected to them &#8212; across some 90 countries, providing real-time diagnostics across the datapoints generated by those devices to predict problems with hardware, software and network, or with security issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atera&#8217;s aim is to use the funding both to continue building out that customer footprint, and to expand its product &#8212; specifically adding more functionality to the AI that it currently uses (and for which Atera has been granted patents) to run predictive analytics, one of the technologies that today are part and parcel of solutions targeting larger enterprises but typically are absent from much of the software out there aimed at SMBs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in essence democratizing capabilities that exist for enterprises but not for the other half of the economy, SMBs,&#8221; said Gil Pekelman, Atera&#8217;s CEO, in an interview.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by General Atlantic, and it is notable for being only the second time that Atera has ever raised money &#8212; the first was earlier this year, a $25 million round from K1 Investment Management, which is also in this latest round. Before this year, Atera, which was founded in 2016, turned profitable in 2017 and then intentionally went out of profit in 2019 as it used cash from its balance sheet to grow. Through all of that, it was bootstrapped. (And it still has cash from that initial round earlier this year.)</p>
<p>As Pekelman &#8212; who co-founded the company with Oshri Moyal (CTO) &#8212; describes it, Atera&#8217;s approach to remote monitoring and management, as the space is typically called, starts first with software clients installed at the endpoints that connect into a network, which give IT managers the ability to monitor a network, regardless of the actual physical range, as if it&#8217;s located in a single office. Around that architecture, Atera essentially monitors and collects &#8220;datapoints&#8221; covering activity from those devices &#8212; currently taking in some 40,000 datapoints per second.</p>
<p>To be clear, these datapoints are not related to what a person is working on, or any content at all, but how the devices behave, and the diagnostics that Atera amasses and focuses on cover three main areas: hardware performance, networking and software performance and security. Through this, Atera&#8217;s system can predict when something might be about to go wrong with a machine, or why a network connection might not be working as it should, or if there is some suspicious behavior that might need a security-oriented response. It supplements its work in the third area with integrations with third-party security software &#8212; Bitdefender and Acronis among them &#8212; and by issuing updated security patches for devices on the network.</p>
<p>The whole system is built to be run in a self-service way. You buy Atera&#8217;s products online, and there are no salespeople involved &#8212; in fact most of its marketing today is done through Facebook and Google, Pekelman said, which is one area where it will continue to invest. This is one reason why it&#8217;s not really targeted larger enterprises (the others are the level of customization that would be needed; as well as more sophisticated service level agreements). But it is also the reason why Atera is so cheap: it costs $89 per month per IT technician, regardless of the number of endpoints that are being managed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our constituencies are up to 1,000 employees, which is a world that was in essence quite neglected up to now,&#8221; Pekelman said. &#8220;The market we are targeting and that we care about are these smaller guys and they just don’t have tools like these today.&#8221; Since model is $89 dollars per month per technician using the software, it means that a company with 500 people with four technicians is paying $356 per month to manage their networks, peanuts in the greater scheme of IT services, and one reason why Atera has caught on as more and more employees have gone remote, and are looking like they will stay that way.</p>
<p>And the fact that this model is thriving is also one of the reason and investors are interested.</p>
<p>“Atera has developed a compelling all-in-one platform that provides immense value for its customer base, and we are thrilled to be supporting the company in this important moment of its growth trajectory,” said Alex Crisses, MD, Global Head of New Investment Sourcing and Co-Head of Emerging Growth at General Atlantic, in a statement. “We are excited to work with a category-defining Israeli company, extending General Atlantic’s presence in the country’s cutting-edge technology sector and marking our fifth investment in the region. We look forward to partnering with Gil, Oshri, and the Atera team to help the company realize its vision.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.class.com/">Class</a>, a virtual classroom that integrates exclusively with Zoom, announced today that it has raised $105 million in a financing led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">The 10-month old startup</a> has now raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/class-series-a-zoom/">a total of $146 million</a> in known venture funding to date, which eclipses the amount of capital raised by founder Michael Chasen’s now-public previous company, Blackboard.</p>
<p>Despite its infancy, Class is rapidly nearing unicorn status, confirming that it currently sports a post-money valuation of $804 million. Other investors in Class include GSV Ventures and Emergence Capital, who led the startups’ pre-seed round, as well as top U.S. edtech funds including Reach Capital, Owl Ventures, Insight Partners and Learn Capital.</p>
<p>Class, formerly Class for Zoom, uses management and instruction tools to bolster the video conferencing call experience. Since launch, Class has integrated exclusively with the videoconferencing giant, which rose to household name prominence during the initial months of the pandemic and continues to be a mainstay in synchronous communication. It’s part of a wave of Zoom alternatives and enhancements that have launched over the past year &#8211; and to date has over 250 customers. <img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2182954 alignnone" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png" alt="" width="604" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement of the SoftBank stamp of approval means that Class is making two statements: one, that it&#8217;s taking global expansion seriously, and two, I&#8217;d argue that it’s signaling that it is not looking to be just an acquisition target for Zoom.</p>
<h2><strong>Globalization of edtech</strong></h2>
<p>SoftBank likes to back what it views as “winner” in one sector and throw millions into it to help it foothold international markets. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">the Japanese conglomerate put millions into Clearco</a>, formerly Clearbanc, to help the alternative financing startup grow into new geographies beyond Europe, Canada and the United States. At this point, I imagine SoftBank is looking for opinionated startups that are naturally pulled internationally, and then funds the heck out of them.</p>
<p>Class is no different. Chasen explained how international demand for the product has been high since Class announced its seed round. Schools from Europe, the Middle East and Japan reached out before Class had rolled out general availability. Now, with Class&#8217; general availability rolled out on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android and Chromebook, Chasen is focusing on turning those on the waitlist into customers.</p>
<p>Class&#8217; international expansion will see it build up local teams in target regions such as the UK and Ireland, EMEA, Latin American and APAC. The startup is expecting to add 100 new team members across the world to its already 200-person team.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech&#8217;s venture-backed globalization pauses at China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/embed/#?secret=cf0JB6wGrZ" data-secret="cf0JB6wGrZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chasen estimates that 65% of the financing will fuel Class’ internationalization and that the remaining will be allocated toward product development. One critique of Class is that the platform offers the same experience to a second grade class as it does to a higher-ed class. Chasen agreed that the startup needs to add more specificity to its product &#8211; perhaps gamification for K-12 and exam proctoring for higher ed &#8211; in future versions.</p>
<p>“V1 gives you what we believe is the bare minimum you need to teach online,” he said, noting features such as testing and grade trackers. “Right now, we need a product that works well across every market, and in the future we’ll make enhancements that are specific for the markets.”</p>
<p>And so far, users are paying for it. Class said that its revenue grew almost 4X quarter over quarter in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Friends with Zoom benefits </strong></h2>
<p>While there’s a numbing effect around big rounds and flashy valuations, Class’ recent raise could squash questions around whether it’s teeing itself up for an eventual acquisition by Zoom.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch first spoke to Chasen, he said that Zoom is focused more on scale than the sort of in-depth specialization that Class wants to provide.</p>
<p>Still, the company was in kahoots with Zoom’s earliest investors and acted as a Zoom reseller in multiple markets, suggesting that consolidation wouldn’t be too wild of an assumption down the road. After today, though, it’s clear Class views itself as a standalone business. Startups don’t just raise nine-figure funding rounds from savvy investors unless they have ambitions to be bigger than an integration.</p>
<p>Going forward, Class may use some of those millions to establish its brand as the go-to option for schools or institutions that want a classroom-friendly Zoom environment. <a href="https://www.class.com/careers/">Per Class’ careers page</a>, marketing is its most aggressive hiring focus right now. The company has six open roles in the marketing team, which include an international marketing manager and a content marketing manager.</p>
<p>Class’ closest competitor is Engageli, which last raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/engageli-nabs-33m-more-for-its-collaborative-video-based-teaching-platform/">$33 million Series A in May 2021.</a> Engageli&#8217;s co-founder and COO, Jamie Farrell, left in February 2021 for another edtech startup, and the company doesn&#8217;t appear to be hiring too aggressively via online job boards. While the details are anecdotal, Engageli may face steeper competition in terms of bandwidth and marketing now that Class has fresh capitalization &#8211; and a growing team of global employees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's Shelf Life project aims to remedy the inventory-management issues in Africa's retail pharmacies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmacies in Africa struggle with access to finance, but inventory management is really what bogs them down. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ow do pharmaceutical retailers know how much stock they need? How do they know which products to stock at a given time? How do they know what products aren&#8217;t selling? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there&#8217;s not enough data to answer these questions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cash gets tied up; there are more or fewer products than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a particular time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it&#8217;s the former, they run a risk of selling expired products. If it&#8217;s the latter, patients can&#8217;t get what they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://field.inc/">Field Intelligence</a> is digitizing this supply-chain process to help African pharmacies sell better. The company, which started in 2015, was government-focused and tried to tackle the challenges facing the public health supply chain in Nigeria&#8217;s capital city, Abuja.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Michael Moreland said he noticed that independent pharmacies in Abuja faced similar challenges to the government-owned ones. After building a SaaS platform to manage complex and large-scale pharmaceutical distribution for the government, the company decided to branch out into the private space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In trying to solve that supply-chain problem, Field Intelligence shifted from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strictly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being a software company to become a pharmaceutical distributor using technology to reimagine how the value chain works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence launched <a href="https://shelflife.co/">Shelf Life</a> in 2017 as the standalone product to handle this transition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Up until now, they had operations in Abuja, Lagos and Nairobi. The product aims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to solve the inventory problem across Africa’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Medical%20Products/Our%20Insights/Africa%20A%20continent%20of%20opportunity%20for%20pharma%20and%20patients/Africa_a_continent_of_opportunity_for_pharma_and_patients.pdf">$65 billion pharmaceutical market</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company announced its expansion into 11 cities across Nigeria and Kenya. The seven cities in Nigeria include Delta, Edo, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, Kwara and Rivers. In Kenya, it&#8217;s Eldoret, Kisumi, Mombasa and Naivasha. The expansion will build on Field Intelligence’s more than 700 existing pharmacies, which have served over 1.4 million patients so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelf Life takes the burden and risk of inventory off the pharmacies. It manages forecasting, quality assurance, fulfillment and inventory management via a subscription service. Pharmacies sell Shelf Life-supplied goods on consignment through a pay-as-you-sell program, avoiding expiry risk and accessing a cheaper alternative to working capital finance. The company claims that this model allowed pharmacies to grow an average of 25% CAGR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched Shelf Life in 2017 to allow pharmacies to outsource their supply chain to us. And it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from there,&#8221; Moreland said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And as we built up, we expanded down to Lagos and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Nairobi to see if it would work in East Africa in that context, and it did</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We haven&#8217;t looked back since then. The future of the business is in the private pharmacy market.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence concluded its first round of outside capital in March last year, <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/12/nigeria-based-e-health-startup-field-intelligence-raises-3-6m/">a $3.6 million Series A</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expansion, but the pandemic stalled that plan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence went back to work by the end of Q4 2020 and planted the initial seeds of what has grown until this moment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Importance of data in Field Intelligence&#8217;s operations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This expansion comes a year after the company experienced rapid sales and Shelf Life membership subscriptions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales grew by 47% in Nigeria and 65% in Kenya, selling over 586,950 products in 63 different product categories</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using data to optimize predictions and identify irregularities in the market, Field Intelligence met the demands for prescription and over-the-counter drugs. But how does it receive and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see that as a math problem. And that starts with having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great data about what&#8217;s selling across a wide number of locations and different seasons, across a wide formulary of products,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182987" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182987" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182987" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?w=680" alt="Shelf Life" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182987" class="wp-caption-text">A Shelf Life agent</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Field Intelligence introduces Shelf Life to a pharmacy, it takes over its supply chain and inventory management processes. The company has fulfillment partners to manage the pharmacy&#8217;s stock counts, inventory management and merchandising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data about stock positions and movements at the retail level comes from a wide array of locations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the company can build a proprietary dataset that shows pharmacies in real-time, providing insights into demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that, Field Intelligence provides visibility and control of pharmaceutical procurement and inventory management. This eliminates frequent over- and understocking; pharmacies can change products or prices based on the information available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fulfillment partners operate an asset-light model, which Moreland said allowed the company &#8220;to build a scalable and intelligent distribution service that operates lean but yet creates a lot of value for the patients and retailers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can say that our level of the value chain here as sort of this tech-enabled distributor, there&#8217;s nobody that operates at this level of the supply chain in so many cities,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelf Life is currently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in more than 700 pharmacies across Nigeria and Kenya. The company says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has more than 4,500 registered pharmacies and over 15,000 drugstores; while Kenya has 6,000 registered pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So there&#8217;s plenty of market share to capture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By next year, Field Intelligence plans to surpass 2,000 Shelf Life pharmacies and drugstores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By 2025, the company is targeting 12,000 pharmacies and drugstores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreland said that the company has grown 5x </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recurring revenue, adding that Shelf Life has sold more drugs and served more patients in the last three months than its first three years of business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Field Intelligence is looking to tackle inventory management with Shelf Life, Moreland believes the company is also effectively solving a finance problem too because it provides an alternative to traditional financing options by lowering the cost of running a pharmacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the big value propositions for us is that because we are selling on consignment, we free up a lot of working capital for the retailer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the market, we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seen as a financial services provider and a form of alternative finance for our pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a big part of our story because when you compare the cost of joining Shelf Life to accessing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of working capital from microfinance or traditional bank, even concessionary lenders, we can be 60 to 80% cheaper with far more value-added services,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tyranny of the Excel spreadsheet continues, and especially in rostering staff. Nowhere is this more acutely felt in today’s COVID-pressured hospital wards, which are now depleted not just by the disease but by staff burnout from patchy-over or under-scheduling of staff hours. Two doctors realized this and decided to create a startup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patchwork.health/">Patchwork Health</a> has now raised £3.5m from Praetura Ventures and BMJ New Ventures, the investment arm of BMJ (global healthcare knowledge provider and publisher of The BMJ).</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by NHS doctors Anas Nader and Jing Ouyang, the platform is now used by over 70 NHS sites to fill vacant shifts and offer staff flexible working. It couldn’t have come sooner: The NHS currently has 90,000 vacancies and 1 in 5 staff are said to be considering quitting due to stress and exhaustion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Patchwork replaces this spreadsheet with a dashboard which predicts when temporary staff will be needed. Shifts are broadcast to an app and temporary staff use the app to select the shifts which suits them. The passporting of credentials, HR paperwork, and payments are all handled through the same system. Full-time healthcare workers can have their personal preferences reflected in their rotas without leaving NHS wards with staffing gaps, the startup says.</p>
<p>Dr Nader said: “We’re already partnering with over 70 NHS sites to tackle the root causes of burnout, offer full-time and temporary staff more choices, and create stronger staffing foundations for hospitals. Through our technology and services, flexible work and safely staffed wards can go hand in hand.”</p>
<p>David Foreman, Managing Director at Praetura Ventures and Non-Executive Director of Patchwork, added: &#8220;From the moment we met Anas and Jing, we could see the passion for their business. Patchwork is helping to solve a staffing crisis in the NHS. They’ve made real strides over the last 18 months and have the potential to make seismic changes in the way we organise staff in one of the world’s largest healthcare systems.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's business boomed amid the pandemic. In January 2020, it had two corporate clients. By December of the same year, it had around 70.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.piposaude.com.br/">Pipo Saude</a>, a startup that developed a platform that sells and manages healthcare benefits for Brazilian companies, has raised $20 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital led the round, marking the first time the New York-based venture firm has led an investment in a Brazilian startup. (Although, notably, Thrive has also put money in Nubank and Loft.)</p>
<p>Atlantico participated in the financing as a new investor in addition to all existing backers including Monashees, Kaszek and OneVC. Nubank co-founder and CEO David Velez and Cedar co-founder and CEO Florian Otto (and former CEO of Groupon in Brazil) also joined in the round. Pipo Saude had raised $4.6 million in a seed round in June 2020 that was led by Monashees and Kaszek with the participation of OneVC and Nubank’s Velez.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pipo Saude raises $4.6 million to bring healthcare benefits management services to Brazil&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/pipo-saude-raises-4-6-million-to-bring-healthcare-benefits-management-services-to-brazil/embed/#?secret=bci5Gvg7JN" data-secret="bci5Gvg7JN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Manoela Mitchell (CEO), Thiago Torres (COO) and Vinicius Correa (CTO) founded Pipo Saude in July 2019 with the goal of “bringing an unparalleled experience” of buying and managing healthcare benefits for corporations in combination with providing a care navigation platform for employees. More simply, its mission is to “transform” the healthcare experience for companies and their employees.</p>
<p>Pipo Saude started selling its solution six months after its inception. Over the past year, it has grown its ARR by “around 5x,” and the number of lives managed by 7.2x, according to Mitchell. Pipo currently has 100 corporate clients and 15,000 lives under management. Its clients include Brazilian unicorns MadeiraMadeira and Buser, Caelum and Funcional Health Tech, among others. Pipo Saude makes money off of commissions and says that its business model is a hybrid of Nava, Accolade and Rightway, but that Zenefits and Amino are inspirations or benchmarks that it &#8220;looks up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Pipo was first founded in 2019, the company was trying to convince prospective customers that digital healthcare could be an interesting option to reduce cost and improve care, according to Mitchell.</p>
<p>And then when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, she added, the whole sector was forced to change and the company saw all stakeholders from doctors to employers to patients “adopting technologies to make their job easier or more accessible to others.”</p>
<p>This trend also helped Pipo grow. In January 2020, it had two corporate clients. By December of the same year, it had around 70.</p>
<p>“COVID has fast-forwarded the digital transformation of the healthcare system everywhere, but even more so in a place like Brazil that was a few years behind the U.S. when it came to technology penetration in the health space,” Mitchell said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182892" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182892" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182892 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="392" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg 7528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=1536,885 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=2048,1180 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Painel-2021-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipo Saude</p></div></p>
<p>Because healthcare is so complex, most companies outsource the benefits capabilities to traditional brokers. Pipo, she said, was created to “disrupt this landscape” with the use of technology and data.</p>
<p>The company claims that enrolling a new member in a healthcare plan can typically take up to 10 business days in Brazil, but that Pipo “can do it in less than 1 hour” given its integrations with HMO/PPOs. It plans to use the new funds to continue investing heavily in technology and data with the goal of launching its first digital product that will be “100% focused” on its members.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo-based Pipo currently has 108 employees distributed across 33 cities and three countries, up from 27 a year ago. During the pandemic, it evolved into being a &#8220;remote-first-company.”</p>
<p>The startup also plans to use its new capital to do some hiring, with the goal of doubling the number of its full-time employees by year’s end. Mitchell described the business model as an “asset-light” one that connects healthcare buyers, users and products without having any type of regulatory capital need.</p>
<p>In the medium to long term, Mitchell said the team views Pipo as a local business rather than a global one.</p>
<p>“Going deep into healthcare data and protocols requires a lot of specialization and deep understanding,” she said. Also, the opportunity in Brazil is just so large.</p>
<p>“We are focused on being the local leader in Brazil rather than having a broader but shallower expertise across many markets,” Mitchell said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kareemzaki/">Kareem Zaki</a>, a general partner at Thrive, said his firm invested in Pipo Saude because it viewed the company as the first of its kind innovating the channel by which healthcare solutions reach individuals and their families.</p>
<p>“Pipo is using data to deliver value at every step of the customer journey, from informing employers&#8217; purchase decisions and automating manual pieces of benefit management to helping employees navigate the healthcare system to meet their individual needs,” he wrote in an email. “The result is 20% better savings, up to 50 times faster workflows, and a 97% customer satisfaction rate that is unprecedented in the industry.”</p>
<p>Pipo Saude is not the only Brazilian startup tackling the benefits space. Earlier this month,<a href="https://flashapp.com.br/"> Flash</a>, a startup that has developed a flexible benefits platform for Brazilian companies and employees, announced it had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/brazilian-hr-startup-flash-raises-22m-in-a-tiger-global-led-series-b-round-of-funding/"> raised $22 million in a Series B round of funding</a> led by Tiger Global Management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gupshup, a business messaging platform that began its journey in India 15 years ago, surprised many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">when it raised $100 million in April this year</a>, roughly 10 years after its last financing round, and attained the coveted unicorn status. Now just three months later, the San Francisco-headquartered startup has secured even more capital from high-profile investors.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/">Gupshup</a> said it had raised an additional $240 million as part of the same Series F financing round. The new investment was led by Fidelity Management, Tiger Global, Think Investments, Malabar Investments, Harbor Spring Capital, certain accounts managed by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers, and White Oak.</p>
<p>Neeraj Arora, formerly a high-profile executive at WhatsApp who played an instrumental role in helping the messaging platform sell to Facebook, also wrote a significant check to Gupshup in the new tranche of investment, which continues to value the startup at $1.4 billion as in April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week, Beerud Sheth, co-founder and chief executive of Gupshup, said he extended the financing round after receiving too many inbound requests from investors. The new investors will provide the startup with crucial insight and expertise, he said. The round is now closed, he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which operates a conversational messaging platform that is used by over 100,000 businesses and developers today to build their own messaging and conversational experiences to serve their users and customers, is beginning to consider exploring the public markets by next year, said Sheth, though he cautioned a final decision is yet to be made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conversation is becoming a bigger part of doing business and it has partly been driven by the pandemic,&#8221; he said over a phone call. &#8220;Second, we have always been the leader in this space, but the product innovation we have focused on in the last two to three years has worked in our favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new investment, which includes some secondary buyback (some early investors and employees are selling their stakes), will be deployed into broadening the product offerings of Gupshup, he said. The startup is also eyeing some M&amp;A opportunities and may close some deals this year, he added.</p>

<p>Before Gupshup became so popular with businesses, it existed in a different avatar. For the first six years of its existence, Gupshup was best known for enabling users in India to send group messages to friends. (These <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/">cheap texts and other clever techniques</a> enabled tens of millions of Indians to stay in touch with one another on phones a decade ago.)</p>
<p>That model eventually became unfeasible to continue, Sheth told TechCrunch in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>“For that service to work, Gupshup was subsidizing the messages. We were paying the cost to the mobile operators. The idea was that once we scale up, we will put advertisements in those messages. Long story short, we thought as the volume of messages increases, operators will lower their prices, but they didn’t. And also the regulator said we can’t put ads in the messages,” he said earlier this year.</p>
<p>That’s when Gupshup decided to pivot. “We were neither able to subsidize the messages, nor monetize our user base. But we had all of this advanced technology for high-performance messaging. So we switched from consumer model to enterprise model. So we started to serve banks, e-commerce firms, and airlines that need to send high-level messages and can afford to pay for it,” said Sheth, who also co-founder freelance workplace Elance in 1998.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gupshup has expanded to <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/gip-messaging-service">newer messaging channels</a>, including <a href="http://store.gupshup.io">conversational bots</a> and it also helps businesses set up and run <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/whatsapp-api">their WhatsApp channels</a> to engage with customers.</p>
<p>Sheth said scores of major firms worldwide in banking, e-commerce, travel and hospitality and other sectors are among the clients of Gupshup. These firms are using Gupshup to send their customers transaction information and authentication codes, among other use cases. “These are not advertising or promotional messages. These are core service information,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have followed Gupshup’s progress for a long while and believe that they are the most evolved customer communications platform In India and increasingly in other emerging markets, with a leadership position in the most attractive and fastest growing sub-segments of the market,” said Sumeet Nagar, Managing Director of Malabar Investments, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We believe that Beerud and team have the unique opportunity to expand the addressable market on the back of new offerings and scale the business up significantly, which is a perfect recipe for massive value creation. I have known Beerud for over three decades, and all of us at Malabar are delighted to partner with Gupshup in the next stage of their journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Something very interesting is going on with supply chains, and has been for a while. But it’s clear the pandemic has accelerated the trend. Tech startups are once again cutting out the middle man, but this time at the supply chain level. The opportunity is to replace supply chains with platforms &#8211; it’s the ‘platformization of supply chains’ if you will.</p>
<p>The latest example of this is <a href="https://www.thecolvinco.com/es">Colvin</a>, a platform for the ‘floriculture’ industry, which has now raised a €45M Series C led by Eurazeo, a private equity and venture capital firm out of France which has invested other marketplaces such as Farfetch, Glovo or ManoMano. Also participating was Capagro, and AgTech and FoodTech VC also out of France.</p>
<p>Launched as a direct-to-consumer brand (which is still maintained) Colvin has now created a B2B category aimed at professionals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sergi Bastardas, cofounder of Colvin said: “2020 has been a year of acceleration for Colvin, a turning point that will set the pace for our growth over the coming years&#8230; Our goal at Colvin is to lead the transformation of the industry at a global level”.</p>
<p>Chloé Giard, Investment Director at Eurazeo said: “Colvin’s trajectory in the flower delivery market has been outstanding. They have proved they could grow both fast and profitably, while expanding into new geographies. This is only a first step in their ambition to build the future of the flower industry: as more and more B2B categories are switching online (see the recent announcements of Ankorstore, Choco or Sennder), the timing is unique to bring a new standard to the flower wholesale market. Colvin is leveraging years of industry expertise, a scalable supply chain, and a global network of trusted growers to seize this $ billion market opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over a call, Bastardas told me: “The Netherlands has a monopoly on the flowers and plants market. Some 65% of all flowers and plants in the world have to pass, physically, through a huge auction that sits in the Netherlands, regardless of where they were cultivated. This is because the industry is not digitalized. So that&#8217;s the problem we were solving: connecting the stakeholders in a more direct way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said they&#8217;d started by connecting growers with customers with a b2c platform: &#8220;We&#8217;ve now started to build out our b2b solution, where we connect our growers, as well as wholesalers directly with retailers, avoiding unnecessary intermediaries, with technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him if he will annoy the industry: &#8220;The intermediaries are going to be mad with us, yes.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-lim-1b312339/">Alex Lim</a>, a British-born VC based in the Bay Area who invested in Hopin, UiPath, Discord, and many other unicorns has decided to up sticks and leave Sand Hill Road behind for Blossom Capital in London. Blossom is fast making a name for itself both in Europe and internationally, having invested in breakout hits like Tines, Duffel, and Checkout.com.</p>
<p>Lim, the youngest-ever Partner promotion at IVP, leaves after six years to take on the role of Managing Partner at Blossom. Blossom founder Ophelia Brown will remain as Co-Managing Partner.</p>
<p>Despite being born in the UK, Lim has spent his entire adult life in the US, so brings an interesting mix of UK/European culture, combined with West Coast savvy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Alex is an exceptional investor and adored by anyone he works with,” said Blossom founder Ophelia Brown. “He builds strong personal connections and is relentlessly committed to founders, which makes him a perfect fit for our team at Blossom. He shares our ethos and approach, which is to put founders at the center of everything we do. Alex brings with him both an incredible level of knowledge and expertise in building technology businesses, as well as a strong network in the US, which our companies will benefit from immensely.”</p>
<p>Lim started his career in investment banking at Credit Suisse, and became IVP’s youngest Partner in its 41-year history.</p>
<p>He told me: “I was promoted last October, to partner. I was the youngest partner in the history of the firm. I&#8217;ve been making European investments for a couple of years now, and that&#8217;s how I met Ophelia.”</p>
<p>He told me that Blossom would be heading more towards Series A investing in the future: “I think it&#8217;s the right strategy for Europe. A European Series A fund is like a very attractive market in my perspective, and it&#8217;s a little bit underserved by the venture community. There are great companies out there. Opportunity is very fragmented across cities. So I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for our style of investing, getting out on the road and meeting entrepreneurs in person.”</p>
<p>He admitted “it&#8217;s a big step to take on a new managing partner. So we&#8217;re entering a new chapter.”</p>
<p>He added that Europe is now ripe for bigger companies and investors: “There’s been a big change over the last 12 months. Some of the outcomes that you&#8217;ve seen over the last few months have been just on a different level to what the European is experience has been before, with huge companies emerging like UIPath and Wise.”</p>
<p>Blossom Capital has also appointed Tatiana Chopova, formerly of McKinsey and Company, Insead and ALPInvest, as Operating Partner, and Kim Goddard as Talent Partner, following his roles in talent acquisition at NuBank, Atlassian and Funding Circle. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An online marketplace for automobiles has become the latest Indian startup to attain the coveted unicorn status.</p>
<p>Gurgaon-headquartered <a href="https://droom.in/">Droom</a> said on Wednesday it is raising up to $200 million in what it described as a pre-IPO growth funding round. The new investment, part of which has been secured, valued the seven-year-old startup at $1.2 billion, up from about $500 million in October 2018.</p>
<p>57 Stars, Seven Train Ventures and several existing investors financed the new round, said the startup, which counts Toyota and Lightbox among its early backers and had raised about $125 million prior to the new investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Droom operates a marketplace in India to help people buy and sell used multi-category vehicles such as cars and motorbikes. The startup provides verified listings for buyers along with tools to view, schedule, negotiate and communicate with the seller. Sellers are provided with tools to manage their listings and estimate prices and dispute issues.</p>
<p>“Droom’s current annual run-rate is $1.7 billion for GMV and $54 million for net revenue. The company remains on track to touch a GMV of $2 billion and a net Revenue of $65 million in CY2021,” it said in a brief statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182967" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182967" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182967 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=1536,834 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=2048,1112 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/droom-india.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182967" class="wp-caption-text">Droom website</p></div></p>
<p>“With the current scale, technology-oriented business, and operational efficiency Droom is nearing profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with other Indian firms including Spinny and Cars24, said it is working to file for an IPO and list on either Nasdaq or in India next year.</p>
<p>“Over the past 7 years, we have invested millions of dollars and thousands of human hours to build a full technology-based end-to-end transactional marketplace for buying and selling of automobiles online,” said Sandeep Aggarwal, founder and chief executive of Droom, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We have developed the complete technology-based machinery starting from first-mile services such as OBV, ECO, and History to mid-mile services like loan &amp; insurance and last-mile services like doorstep delivery. Droom has been on a steady growth trajectory after Covid. While automobile is the largest retail category, it is the least penetrated online. In a post-pandemic world, we expect automobile buying and selling to shift online rapidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Droom is the 17th Indian startup to become a unicorn as high-profile investors double down on their bets in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p><em><strong>Updated at 1.06 pm on July 28: </strong>The story was updated to note that Droom is raising up to $200 million &#8212; and hasn&#8217;t yet raised all of it. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting and improve their operational efficiency by digitizing payments to workers and suppliers instead of relying on cash.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/mobile-money-accounts-grow-to-1-2-billion-in-2020/">over 1 billion mobile money</a> accounts globally. Africa leads the way in transaction value and volume thanks to M-Pesa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used in East Africa. Other regions across the continent are also growing fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, West Africa reported the most live mobile money services in any region, with 56 million active accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Ivory Coast, one of Francophone Africa&#8217;s largest mobile money markets, 75% of the population own a mobile money account, compared to 20% who own bank accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference is staggering and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the region&#8217;s huge appetite for the service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While telecom operators have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated mobile money services across most of sub-Saharan Africa, a few startups are trying to change the mobile money experience for customers. Ivory Coast-based fintech startup <a href="https://julaya.co/">Julaya</a> is one such company, and today, it announced a $2 million pre-Series A funding to expand its products across West Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 by <a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/mathiasleopoldie">Mathias Léopoldie</a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/charles-talbot-b1b43784">Charles Talbot</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before launching Julaya, they worked at French payment fintech LemonWay on their service in Mali and Burkina Faso</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Léopoldie told TechCrunch that the experience introduced them to how mobile money worked across Francophone Africa. LemonWay acts as a payment solution for marketplaces. So, while working on expanding the fintech&#8217;s service in both countries, the pair noticed the massive potential businesses had to reach the unbanked via the large consumer penetration of telecom operators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to digitize trade payments but started in the Ivory Coast instead of Mali and Burkina Faso. The platform enables companies to streamline their accounting and improve their operational efficiency by digitizing payments to workers and suppliers instead of relying on cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company helps African businesses and institutions disburse payments to mobile money and mobile banking wallets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It achieves this by working with telecom operators and other fintech startups in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mobile money is coming to a mature stage where business and public institution use-cases provide new growth opportunities for the sector. The pandemic has opened up minds about the urge to digitize payments. Fintech competition in West Africa is making digital finance more affordable for consumers, and technical integrations with telecom operators are becoming more reliable,” Talbot said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, these partnerships haven&#8217;t come without their own share of challenges. For one, payments technology in Francophone Africa remains quite fragmented, and APIs from telecoms are still burgeoning and somewhat unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Léopoldie added that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges come from distribution channels, making it difficult for the company to sell en masse at a cheap cost, as well as from the untrustworthiness of businesses toward digitized payments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Ivory Coast, a wire transfer takes between one to three days, and you always have to check with your bank branch as a customer. … Businesses do not trust digital experiences as they often have shortcomings, and educating the market bears a high cost on acquisition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, talents that have a startup mindset are still difficult to find,&#8221; Léopoldie said of some of the challenges facing the three-year-old startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2182901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, the startup, which has an R&amp;D and technical team in France, has bagged customers from SMBs and large corporates to government institutions. The company says it&#8217;s currently processing over $1.5 million monthly for 50 of these customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, SODECI, Ministry of Education, Ivory Coast and the World Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya closed a pre-seed investment of $250,000 in 2018 and a seed investment of $550,000 a year later, all from angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the company has introduced VC firms in its pre-Series A round. They include corporate venture capital firms Orange Ventures and MFS Africa Frontiers; VC firms Saviu Ventures, Launch Africa and 50 Partners Capital; and some angel investors in Africa and Europe. Julaya will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to broaden its market share in Ivory Coast and launch digital payment products and expand across West Africa.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 20 million people use Orange as a mobile money service across 15 African countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The telecom operator also recently launched a mobile banking platform in Ivory Coast and has surpassed 500,000 users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, what&#8217;s the rationale behind this strategic investment, which marks <a href="https://ventures.orange.com/portfolio/?location%5B%5D=MEA">its third check</a> in an African fintech startup after South Africa&#8217;s Yoco and Senegal&#8217;s SudPay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fintech’s environment in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is distinguished by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its competitiveness and strong dynamism. Orange Group, through its technology investment fund, intends to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this boom by supporting fintechs such as Julaya. The goal is to target local technology champions at the service of the transition to a more digital and responsible world,” said Habib Bamba, the director of Transformation, digital and media at Orange Ivory Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange, other telecom operators, fintechs and banks remain big competitors to Julaya. So h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ow does it plan to stay on top of people&#8217;s minds across the region? Léopoldie thinks that focusing on the best user experience might do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This sounds like an overheard statement, but we understand that what the customer values most is reliable customer support and a predictable and smooth online experience, for instance, a reliable platform with very little downtime,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even if you only have a 90% success rate on your transactions, as long as you give this information in a transparent communication to the customer, they will trust you.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">In Bangladesh, students often rely on after school learning centers for study help or test preparation, but many of the best ones are concentrated in major cities. Edtech startup <a href="https://shikho.tech/">Shikho</a> was created to make supplementary education more accessible and affordable. The company announced today it has closed a $1.3 million seed round co-led by returning investor LearnStart (the seed fund of edtech investment firm Learn Capital) and Anchorless Bangladesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The round also included participation from Wavemaker Partners and Ankur Nagpal, founder and chief executive officer of online course platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/edtech-notches-a-win-as-teachable-is-acquired-by-hotmart/">Teachable</a>. Shikho’s last round of funding was $275,000 in pre-seed financing last year from LearnStart and strategic angel investors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Founded in April 2019, Shikho is focused on grades 9, 10, 11 and 12, with plans to introduce content for grades 6 up to university level and continuous education. Its learning material, created by educators and subject experts, is based on the Bangladeshi National Curriculum. To keep students engaged, it uses gamification techniques, like points, leaderboards and virtual awards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">Shikho was founded in April 2019 by CEO Shahir Chowdhury, who previously worked in finance and business, including as a director at HSBC UK’s Private Bank, and chief operating officer Zeeshan Zakaria, who also worked in finance before becoming a mathematics teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Both grew up in Dhaka before moving to the United Kingdom, where they went to university. Chowdhury told TechCrunch that even while working in finance, his goal was to launch a socially impactful business in Bangladesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian edtech startup Gredu raises $4M Series A to keep teachers, parents and students engaged with one another&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/indonesian-edtech-startup-gredu-raises-4m-series-a-to-keep-teachers-parents-and-students-engaged-with-one-another/embed/#?secret=ldVU9JZNwJ" data-secret="ldVU9JZNwJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">At first, Chowdhury looked at fintech because of his career experience, but realized there were already many players focused on financial inclusion in Bangladesh, like bKash. He started thinking about education&#8211;Chowdhury’s father is a retired professor and his mother still teaches high school. Then by coincidence, he worked on a client report about the emergence of Indian and Chinese edtech startups, like Byju&#8217;s and Toppr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I tried to understand what edtech was and why it was working in those markets and why it didn’t exist in Bangladesh,” said Chowdhury. “When I looked at that closely, there was no reason for it not to exist in Bangladesh. From an macroeconomic perspective, you have all the elements you need. You have a very large population, about 165 million people, and half of that is under the age of 25.”</p>
<p class="p3">Chowdhury reached out to Zakaria to lead Shikho’s academic programming. Shikho’s goal is to find more engaging and effective ways to teach students material from the Bangladesh National Curriculum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Not much has changed since my dad was in grade 10 in terms of the syllabus,” said Zakaria. “I’m not a politician, so I can’t bring about change there, but I can change how it’s delivered. We deliver the curriculum in a way that has never been seen before in terms of the pedagogical experience.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Shikho launched about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic began, but that didn’t change its approach to product development because it was always meant to be an online learning platform.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The company works with educators to create content, including animated videos that break down topics into short segments of about six minutes each to help students learn at their own pace. Each video is supplemented with digital resources called smart notes to replace the guidebooks many students buy for studying, and practice questions with detailed solutions.</p>
<p class="p3">Shikho’s main video content is pre-recorded, but it will also launch live classes for its app and web portal in about six weeks. The company’s new funding will allow it to scale-up content production, including an app for parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">One of the biggest challenges for online learning platforms is keeping students motivated. Chowdhury said Shikho’s gamification system was inspired by the Nike Run Club app. Similar to how Nike Run Club users get points every time they go on a run, Shikho gives students points when they log in, do a test or watch a video. The points can be collected for milestones ranging from beginner to “legend,” and special badges are awarded for accomplishments like finishing a test quickly and accurately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The point system also feeds into a leaderboard, so students can see how many points they have compared to other Shikho users at their school, or on the entire app.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The app is free to use for seven days. One of the company’s plans for its new funding is to launch more freemium content to increase user conversions into paying customers. Chowdhury says that paying users have high engagement rates, typically spending about 45 to 50 minutes daily in the app. Shikho plans to double-down on its user acquisition strategy, including offline sales teams in front of schools, at the end of the year after launching its app for parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Students are the users and the actual customers are their parents, so we’re conscious that we’re going to have to flip communication to the parents,” said Chowdhury. “That’s part of what this funding round is for.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">In statement about investment, Anchorless Bangladesh founding partner and CEO Rahat Ahmed said, “Bangladesh has one of the largest allocations of private education expenditure as a percentage of disposable income in the world, but lags behind countries like India and Indonesia when it comes to edtech funding. The market is primed for growth and we believe the team at Shikho is well-fit to lead the charge and take education to the next level.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
