										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The future of work is long on long-distance, and today a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help organizations hire global talent and build out those remote workforces is announcing a round of funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysterhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a> &#8212; which provides tools to help with hiring, onboarding, payroll, benefits and salary management services for both contractors and full-time employees working outside of an organization&#8217;s home country &#8212; has closed a Series B of $50 million.</p>
<p>We understand that the funding is coming in at a $475 million valuation, six times the company&#8217;s valuation when it last raised money &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million round just four months ago</a>. The company itself has seen business grow &#8220;exponentially&#8221; since then, said Tony Jamous, London-based Oyster&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Jack Mardack. The company now works with 80 large businesses, he said, helping them fill knowledge worker roles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Stripes is leading the Series B, with previous backers Emergence Capital and The Slack Fund, as well as new investor Avid Ventures, also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told me back in February</a> that the idea for building Oyster was first planted when he was working at his first startup, Nexmo (which eventually he sold to Vonage), after being faced with the challenges of hiring talent internationally, and specifically the millions the company invested to build out the infrastructure to do so itself, since every country has very specific procedures for employing people and handling all of the contractural, tax, and regulatory details related to that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster&#8217;s mission has been to  make it possible for any company to hire wherever they want, without going through that pain themselves, making the &#8220;world their oyster,&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While that in itself is a great idea that definitely fills a need for businesses, it has also been compounded by recent changing tides. Not only are more people wanting to work further afield, but at &#8220;home&#8221;, many companies &#8212; especially those who need to fill knowledge worker roles &#8212; are facing talent shortages. All of this is driving even more demand for sourcing and hiring candidates from further afield, and a culture in the workplace that it&#8217;s possible to work well even if you are not in the same physical space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What&#8217;s happening in the world is that there&#8217;s a talent shortage, and also there&#8217;s no need to be in the office anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it comes to tapping into the global talent pool, if you think about it, if you&#8217;re a London-based company, then the chances that your best talent is in London is less than 1%. So by tapping into the global talent pool, suddenly you&#8217;re dramatically increasing your chances, especially if you depend on talent as as a key source of your success.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of startups in the market today targeting the remote working opportunity &#8212; helping companies source and hire people wherever they happen to be located &#8212; and Oyster is not the only one of them raising big money to scale. Others include Deel, which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/payroll-startup-deel-raises-funds-at-1-25-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $1.25 billion</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>; Papaya Global (now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, and many more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster is not &#8212; yet? &#8212; in the business of helping to source or vet potential hires, but once someone is identified and an organization wants to make an offer, Oyster provides a seamless way to handle the rest, including giving advice on whether it&#8217;s best to hire the person as a contractor or full time employee (the trend here, he said, is full-time), how to handle benefits based on the country in which the talent is based; and other aspects of remuneration, again particular to each local market. Pricing ranges from $29 per person, per month for contractors, to $399 for working with full employees, to other packages for larger deployments.</p>
<p>The company also has a public service mission in all this. Jamous himself originally hails from Lebanon and has a particular mission to help people from less high-profile parts of the world, and emerging countries, also get on the career ladder. In this day and age, since relocation and migration are no longer a must-do, it opens up a lot of opportunities for people that didn&#8217;t exist before. Oyster applied for, and now has B-Corp certification, which it&#8217;s using to fill out that global employment and talent mandate.</p>
<p>This is not just for greater good, though. There are actual talent shortages, and a recent study from Korn Ferry, cited by Oyster, found that 1.5 billion knowledge workers will be entering the workforce in the next decade from emerging economies. Building tools to help hire and manage that talent makes business sense.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with Stripes for the next chapter of growth and positive impact for Oyster,” said Jack Mardack, co-Founder of Oyster, in a statement. “Investors like Stripes, Emergence, Slack Fund, Avid, and PeopleTech Partners among others, who share in our passion for the Oyster mission and vision for the future of work, give us the rocket fuel we need to change the world by unblocking access to job opportunities for everyone.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition to remote work is one of the most fundamental macro trends in business today and COVID-19 accelerated that transition by 10 years,” said Saagar Kulkarni, partner at Stripes, in a statement. “Oyster makes it seamless for any company to hire the best person for each job, removing location as a barrier. Tony and the team have built the best software product in the market and are poised to build a market-defining company. We are thrilled to join the entire Oyster team on their mission to level the playing field for the global workforce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a>, a service that helps businesses analyze and reduce their AWS costs, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz. A number of angel investors, including Brianne Kimmel, Julia Lipton, Stephanie Friedman, Calvin French Owen, Ben and Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer and Justin Gage, also participated in this round</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/vantage-makes-managing-aws-easier/">started out</a> with a focus on making the AWS console a bit easier to use &#8212; and help businesses figure out what they are spending their cloud infrastructure budgets on in the process. But as Vantage co-founder and CEO Ben Schaechter told me, it was the cost transparency features that really caught on with users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were advertising ourselves as being an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency,&#8221; he said.&#8221;What was interesting is &#8212; even in the early days of early access before the formal GA launch in January &#8212; I would say more than 95% of the feedback that we were getting from customers was entirely around the cost features that we had in Vantage.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2168621" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168621" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168621" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="761" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png 2484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=768,571 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=2048,1522 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_costs@2x.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168621" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p>
<p>Like any good startup, the Vantage team looked at this and decided to double down on these features and highlight them in its marketing, though it kept the existing AWS Console-related tools as well. The reason the other tools didn&#8217;t quite take off, Schaechter believes, is because more and more, AWS users have become accustomed to infrastructure-as-code to do their own automatic provisioning. And with that, they spend a lot less time in the AWS Console anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one consistent thing &#8212; across the board &#8212; was that people were having a really, really hard time twelve times a year, where they would get a shock AWS bill and had to figure out what happened. What Vantage is doing today is providing a lot of value on the transparency front there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, the team added a number of new features to its cost transparency tools, including machine learning-driven predictions (both on the overall account level and service level) and the ability to share reports across teams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168622" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168622" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png 2484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=2048,1405 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168622" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p>
<p>While Vantage expects to add support for other clouds in the future, likely starting with Azure and then GCP, that&#8217;s actually not what the team is focused on right now. Instead, Schaechter noted, the team plans to add support for bringing in data from third-party cloud services instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one line item for companies tends to be AWS, GCP, Azure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But then, after that, it&#8217;s Datadog Cloudflare Sumo Logic, things along those lines. Right now, there&#8217;s no way to see, P&amp;L or an ROI from a cloud usage-based perspective. Vantage can be the tool where that&#8217;s showing you essentially, all of your cloud costs in one space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is likely the vision the investors bought in as well and even though Vantage is now going up against enterprise tools like Apptio&#8217;s Cloudability and VMware&#8217;s CloudHealth, Schaechter doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that worried about the competition. He argues that these are tools that were born in a time when AWS had only a handful of services and only a few ways of interacting with those. He believes that Vantage, as a modern self-service platform, will have quite a few advantages over these older services.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get up and running in a few clicks. You don&#8217;t have to talk to a sales team. We&#8217;re helping a large number of startups at this stage all the way up to the enterprise, whereas Cloudability and Cloud Health are, in my mind, kind of antiquated enterprise offerings. No startup is choosing to use those at this point, as far as I know,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The team, which until now mostly consisted of Schaechter and his co-founder and CTO Brooke McKim, bootstrapped to company up to this point. Now they plan to use the new capital to build out its team (and the company is actively hiring right now), both on the development and go-to-market side.</p>
<p>The company offers a <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/pricing">free starter plan</a> for businesses that track up to $2,500 in monthly AWS cost, with paid plans starting at $30 per month for those who need to track larger accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pro-privacy browser <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">testing its own brand search engine</a> for several months &#8212; operating a waitlist where brave (ha!) early adopters could kick the tyres of an upstart alternative in Internet search &#8212; has now launched the tool, Brave Search, in global beta.</p>
<p>Users interested in checking out Brave&#8217;s non-tracking search engine, which is built on top of an independent index and touted as a privacy-safe alternative to surveillance tech products like Google search, will find it via Brave&#8217;s desktop and mobile browsers. It can also be reached from other browsers via <a href="https://search.brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://search.brave.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB4NzAgBdIdSTvM0yk0hGH1LyDtA">search.brave.com</a> &#8212; so doesn&#8217;t require switching to Brave&#8217;s browser to use.</p>
<p>Brave Search is being offered as one of multiple search options that users of the company&#8217;s eponymous browser can pick from (including Google&#8217;s search engine). But Brave says it will make it the default search in its browser later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As we reported back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">March</a>, the company acquired technology and developers who had previously worked on Cliqz, a European anti-tracking search-browser combo which closed down in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">May 2020</a> &#8212; building on a technology they&#8217;d started to develop, called Tailcat, to form the basis of the Brave-branded search engine.</p>
<p>The (now beta) search engine has been tested by more than 100,000 &#8220;early access users&#8221; at this point, per Brave. It&#8217;s made this <a href="https://vimeo.com/565464396/5eedcfd477">video ad</a> to tout its &#8220;all in one&#8221; alternative to Google search + Chrome.</p>

<p>Growing public awareness of surveillance based business models has been building momentum for pro-privacy consumer tech for a number of years. And several players which started out with a strong focus on one particular pro-privacy product (such as a browser, search engine or email) have been expanding into a full suite of products &#8212; all under the same non-tracking umbrella.</p>
<p>As well as Brave, there&#8217;s the likes of DuckDuckGo &#8212; which offers non-tracking search but also a tracker blocker and an email inbox protector tool, among other products, and reckons it now has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">between 70M-100M users</a> overall; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/">Proton, the maker of e2e-encrypted email service ProtonMail</a> but also a cloud calendar and file storage as well as a VPN. The latter recently confirmed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">passing 50M users globally</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Apple itself too, of course &#8212; a Big Tech giant that competes with Google and the adtech complex by promising users a privacy premium to drive sales of its hardware and services. (At the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">start of this year</a> Apple said there are now over 1BN iOS users globally &#8212; and over 1.65BN Apple devices.)</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The market for privacy consumer tech is growing.</p>
<p>Still, even Apple doesn&#8217;t try to compete against Google search which perhaps underlines the scale of the challenge involved in trying to poach users from the search behemoth. (Albeit, Apple extracts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/google-paying-apple-3-billion-to-remain-default-search--bernstein.html">massive payments from Google</a> to preload the latter&#8217;s search engine onto iOS devices &#8212; which does conflict with (and complicate) its wider, pro-privacy, pro-user promises while also adding a nice revenue boost for Apple&#8230; ).</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo has, by contrast, been at the non-tracking search coalface for years &#8212; and turning a profit since 2014. Though clearly not in the same profit league as Apple. But, more recently, it&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push/">taken in rare tranches of external funding</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/">as its investors spy growing opportunity</a> for private search.</p>
<p>Other signs of expanding public appetite to protect people&#8217;s information from commercial snoopers include the surge of usage for e2e encrypted alternatives to Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">such as Signal</a> &#8212; which saw a download spike earlier this year, after the advertising giant announced unilateral changes to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>Credible players that have amassed a community of engaged users around a core user privacy promise are well positioned to ride each new wave of privacy interest &#8212; and cross sell a suite of consumer products where they&#8217;ve been able to expand their utility. Hence Brave believing the time is right for it to dabble in search.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, said: “Brave Search is the industry’s most private search engine, as well as the only independent search engine, giving users the control and confidence they seek in alternatives to big tech. Unlike older search engines that track and profile users, and newer search engines that are mostly a skin on older engines and don’t have their own indexes, Brave Search offers a new way to get relevant results with a community-powered index, while guaranteeing privacy. Brave Search fills a clear void in the market today as millions of people have lost trust in the surveillance economy and actively seek solutions to be in control of their data.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On a growth tear, DuckDuckGo reveals it picked up $100M in secondary investment last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/embed/#?secret=5dkET35lvR" data-secret="5dkET35lvR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave touts its eponymous search offering as having a number of differentiating features vs rivals (including smaller rivals) &#8212; such as its own index which it also says gives it independence from other search providers.</p>
<p>Why is having an independent index important? We put that question to Josep M. Pujol, chief of search at Brave, who told us: &#8220;There are plenty of incentives for censorship and biases, either by design, or what is even more difficult to combat, unintentional. The problem of search, and how people access the web, is that it is a mono-culture, and everybody knows that while it’s very efficient, it’s also very dangerous. A single disease can kill all the crops. The current landscape is not fail-tolerant, and this is something that even users are becoming aware of. We need more choices, not to replace Google or Bing, but to offer alternatives. More choices will entail more freedom and also get back to real competition, with checks and balances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice can only be achieved by being independent, as if we do not have our own index, then we are just a layer of paint on top of Google and Bing, unable to change much or anything in the results for users’ queries. Not having your own index, as with certain search engines, gives the impression of choice, but in reality such engine &#8216;skins&#8217; are the same players as the big-two. Only by building our own index, which is a costly proposition, will we be in a position to offer true choice to the users for the benefit of all, whether they are Brave Search users or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although, for now, it&#8217;s worth noting that Brave is relying on some provision from other search providers &#8212; for specific queries and in areas like image search (where, for example, it says it&#8217;s currently fetching results from Microsoft-owned Bing) &#8212; to ensure its results achieve adequate relevancy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere it also says it&#8217;s relying upon anonymized contributions from the community to improve and refine results &#8212; and is seeking to live up to wider transparency claims vis-a-vis the search index (which it also claims has &#8220;no secret methods or algorithms to bias results&#8221;; and for which it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering &#8220;<a href="https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLB7RFV0dgjxk9pRQ0-1MQ27mH0Q">community-curated open ranking models</a> to ensure diversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship&#8221;).</p>
<p>In another transparency step Brave is reporting the percentage of users&#8217; queries that are independent by showing what it bills as &#8220;the industry’s first search independence metric&#8221; &#8212; meaning it displays the ratio of results coming exclusively from its own index.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is derived privately using the user&#8217;s browser as we do not build user profiles,&#8221; Brave notes in a press release. &#8220;Users can check this aggregate metric to verify the independence of their results and see how results are powered by our own index, or if third-parties are being used for long tail results while we are still in the process of building our index.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that Brave Search will &#8220;typically be answering most queries, reflected by a high independence metric&#8221;. Although if you&#8217;re performing an image search, for example, you&#8217;ll see the the independence metric take a hit (but Brave confirms this will not result in any tracking of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;[<a href="https://brave.com/transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/transparency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnUdHuInbNHjYiS__sy4b5fyhfVg">Transparency</a>] is a key principle at Brave, and there will also be a global independence metric for Brave Search across all searches, which we will make publicly available to show how we are progressing towards complete independence,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168093" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168093" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=1536,924 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image001-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168093" class="wp-caption-text">Example of Brave&#8217;s &#8216;independence metric&#8217; for search results (Image credits: Brave)</p></div></p>
<p>On the monetization side, Brave says it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering both a paid ad-free version of search in the future and an ad-supported free version &#8212; while still pledging &#8220;fully anonymous&#8221; search. Though it specifies that it won&#8217;t be flipping the ad switch during the early beta phase.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will offer options for both ad-free paid search and ad-supported free search later,&#8221; it notes. &#8220;When we are ready, we will explore bringing private ads with BAT revenue share to search, as we&#8217;ve done for Brave user ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users of the search engine who do not also use Brave&#8217;s own browser will be served contextual ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brave Search via the browser, strong privacy guarantees for opt-in ads are a norm and a brand value that we uphold,&#8221; adds Pujol, confirming that users of its search and browser are likely to get the same type of ad targeting.</p>
<p>Asked about pricing of the forthcoming ad-free version of the search engine he says: &#8220;Although we have not finalized the launch date or the price yet, our ad-free paid search will be affordable because we believe search, and access to information, should be available on fair terms for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">recent development in Europe</a>, Google &#8212; under pressure from antitrust regulators &#8212; has agreed to ditch a pay-to-play auction model for the choice screen it offers regional users of its Android platform, letting them pick a default search engine from list with a number of rivals and its own brand Google search. The move should expand the number of alternative search engines Android users in Europe are exposed to &#8212; and could help chip away at some of Google&#8217;s search marketshare.</p>
<p>Brave previously told us it would not participate in Google&#8217;s paid auction &#8212; but Pujol says that if the new model is &#8220;truly free to participate&#8221; it will likely take part in future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google and free-to-participate seem difficult to believe, given plenty of precedents but if this model is indeed truly free to participate, without contracts or non-disclosure agreements, then we would likely participate,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, Brave Search is open to everyone who would like to use it, and we are open and happy to put Brave Search on any platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have localized browsers throughout the European market, so in addition to growth via the Brave browser growing, we intend to grow Brave Search’s usage by marketing our best-in-class privacy on all media that reach prospective users,&#8221; he adds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With as much seed capital as there is in the market today, we talked to investors about startups raising later Series As than before, while Series B rounds can happen incredibly rapidly.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/20/softbank-vision-fund-first-close/">announced its first Vision Fund back in 2017</a>, TechCrunch gawked at the size of the fundraising vehicle and its $100 million minimum check size. Noting a few of its early deals, we wrote that &#8220;the party is just getting started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little did we know how accurate that quip would become. The Vision Fund poured capital into a host of companies with big plans, or what could at least be construed as grandiose hypotheses about the future. And after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/the-first-vision-fund-is-officially-done-investing-and-spent-100m-every-day-of-its-existence/">deploying $98.6 billion in a blizzard of deals</a>, SoftBank left the venture capital market changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that the Vision Fund helped make the venture capital game faster in terms of deal pacing and larger in terms of deal scale. The Vision Fund was also content to write checks at amped valuations, leading some investors to privately carp about lost deals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Strange&#8221; may be the best way to describe today&#8217;s venture capital market, at least in the United States.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s venture capital market is currently enduring another wave of venture capital angst, this time driven by Tiger Global. Tiger often writes smaller checks than what SoftBank&#8217;s capital cannon wielded, but its pace and willingness to invest a lot, very early, at prices that other investors balk at, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-tiger-globals-deal-machine">is making waves</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And while Tiger races to build what increasingly appears to be a private index fund of software startups that have reached some sort of scale or growth, the venture capital market is seeing its traditional benchmarks tied to different tiers of investment molt, meld, or disappear altogether.</p>
<p>Old metrics that would ready a startup for a successful Series A are antiquated clichés. As are <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1407289437495640065">round sizes</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Series A startups</a>; it&#8217;s increasingly common for seed-stage startups to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">reload their accounts several times</a> before approaching an A, and Series B rounds often resemble the growth-stage deals of yesteryear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s confusing, and not Tiger&#8217;s fault, per se; the Tiger rush is a variation on the Vision Fund&#8217;s own venture disruption. And the Vision Fund followed in the footsteps of a16z, which raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz/investor_financials/funds">large, rapid funds early in its life</a> and garnered a reputation at the time for having a willingness to pay more than other venture capital firms for the same deal.</p>
<p>Where does all the change leave us? In a fascinating, if turbulent, market for startup fundraising.</p>

During our conversation concerning venture capital dynamics, Seseri said something incredibly interesting: With as much seed capital as there is in the market today, she&#8217;s seeing startups raise later Series As than before. But, she added, with the creep of late-stage capital into the earlier stages of venture investing, Series B rounds can happen rapidly after a company raises an A.</p>
<p>So, slow As and fast Bs. We wanted to dig more into the concept, so we asked a number of other investors about her view. We&#8217;re tackling the question in two parts, focusing on the U.S. market today and the rest of the world later this week.</p>
<p>What we found out is that while Seseri&#8217;s view regarding late As and early Bs is correct for many startups, it really depends on whether they are on the radar of later-stage firms. And yes, some of the investors mentioned Tiger in their responses. Let&#8217;s dive in to understand what founders are really dealing with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve chronicled, in great detail, the many layers of technology, services and solutions that have been wrapped around the world of education in recent years &#8212; and especially in the last year, which became a high watermark for digital learning tools because of COVID-19. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.merlyn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merlyn Mind</a> is coming out of stealth with a proposition that it believes helps tie a lot of this together in the K-12 classroom &#8212; a &#8220;digital assistant&#8221; that comes in the form of a piece of custom hardware and software to &#8220;read&#8221; natural voice and remote control commands from a teacher to control multimedia apps on a screen of choice. Along with this, Merlyn Mind is announcing $29 million in initial funding to build out its vision.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by specialist edtech investor Learn Capital, with other unnamed investors participating. It comes after Merlyn Mind spent about three years quietly building its first release and more recently piloting the service in 50+ classrooms in more than 20 schools.</p>
<p>Co-founded by longtime IBM scientists Satya Nitta (the CEO), Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan &#8212; all of whom spent several years leading education efforts in IBM&#8217;s Watson AI research division &#8212; Merlyn Mind is coming to the market with a patented, vertically integrated solution to solve what Nitta told me in an interview he believes and has seen firsthand to be a fundamental pain point in the world of edtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In effect, education and technology may have now been merged into a single term as far as the tech world is concerned, but in terms of practical, on-the-ground application, many teachers are not making the most of the tools they have in the classroom. The majority are, he believes, facing &#8220;cognitive overload&#8221; (which is not to mention the kids, who themselves probably are facing the same: a problem for it to tackle down the road, I hope), and they need help.</p>
<p class="p1">To be fair, this problem existed before the pandemic, with research from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-k-12-teachers"><span class="s1">McKinsey &amp; Co.</span></a> published in 2020 (and gathered earlier) finding that teachers were already spending more than half of their time on administrative tasks, not teaching or thinking about how and what to teach or what help specific students might need. Other research from <span class="s2"><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56339016e4b095e84e825b9c/t/5f32b92fa125645492b75bf9/1597159728178/EdTech+Insights-+2020+EdTech+Top+40+School+Year+Report.pdf"><span class="s1">Learn Platform</span></a></span> found that teachers potentially have as many as 900 different applications that they can use in a classroom (in practice, Nitta told me a teacher will typically use between 20 and 30 applications, sites and tech services in a day, although even that is a huge amount).</p>
<p class="p1">Post-COVID-19, there are other kinds of new complications to grapple with on top of all that. Not only are many educators now playing catch-up because of the months spent learning at home (it&#8217;s been widely documented that in many cases, students have fallen behind), but overall, education is coming away from our year+ of remote learning with a much stronger mandate to use <em>more</em> tech from now on, not less.</p>
<p class="p1">The help that Merlyn Mind is proposing comes in the form of what the startup describes as an &#8220;AI hub.&#8221; This includes a personal assistant called Merlyn; a classroom AI hub called Symphony Classroom, a kind of Alexa-style voice interface tailored to the educational environment and built on a fork of Android; a smart speaker that looks a bit like a soundbar; and a consumer-style remote that can be used also for navigation and commands.</p>
<p class="p1">These then work with whatever screen the teacher opts to use, whether it is a TV, or an interactive whiteboard, or something else; along with any other connected devices that are used in the classroom, to open and navigate through different apps, including various Google apps, Nearpod, Newsela and so on. (That could potentially also include kids&#8217; individual screens if they are being used.)</p>
<p class="p1">The idea is that if a teacher is in the middle of a lesson on a specific topic and a question comes up that can best be answered by illustrating a concept through another app, a teacher can trigger the system to navigate to a new screen to find that information and instantly show it to the students. The system can also be used to find a teacher&#8217;s own materials on file. The demo I saw worked well enough, although I would love to see how an ordinary teacher &#8212; the kind they&#8217;re hoping will use this &#8212; would fare.</p>
<p class="p1">Everyone knows the expression &#8220;hardware is hard,&#8221; so it&#8217;s interesting to see Merlyn addressing its problem with a hardware-forward approach.</p>
<p>Nitta was very ready with his defense for this one:</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why we built our own hardware,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a bunch of AI processing that&#8217;s happening on the device, for various reasons, including latency and security. So it&#8217;s kind of an edge AI appliance. And the second thing is the microphones. They are designed for the classroom environment, and we wanted to have complete control over the tooling of these microphones for the processing, for the environment, and that is very hard to do. If you are taking a third-party microphone array off the shelf, it&#8217;s impossible, actually, you simply cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s early team is rounded out with alums from the likes of HP Education, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Broadcom and Roku to help build all of this, knowing the challenges they were tackling, but also the payoff once it would be finished if it all works.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e have a very, very talented team, and we basically said, right, this is going to be a lot of hard work that will take us three and a half years. We have to build our own piece of hardware&#8230; and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">we ended up building the entire voice stack from from scratch ourselves, too,&#8221; Nitta continued. &#8220;It means we have end to end control of everything from the hardware all the way to the language models.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He did point out though that over time, there will be some elements that will be usable without all the hardware, in particular when a teacher may suddenly have to teach outside the classroom again in a remote learning environment. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very ambitious concept, but where would education and learning be if not for taking leaps once in a while? That&#8217;s where investors stand on the startup, too.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>&#8220;Just as we saw with the breakthrough edtech company Coursera which reached IPO this year and was started a decade ago by two machine learning professors, in today&#8217;s hypercompetitive market the best edtech companies need to start with an advanced technological core,&#8221; said Rob Hutter, founder and managing partner of Learn Capital. &#8220;<span class="il">Merlyn</span> is one of the first companies to focus on the enhancement of live teaching in classrooms, and it is developing a solution that is so intuitive it allows teachers to leverage technology with mastery while using minimal effort. This is a very promising platform.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The proof will be in how it gets adopted when it finally launches commercially later this year, with pricing to be announced later.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The conversation on founder pay is changing for the better. We've gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;If you&#8217;re the founder of a seed-stage [company and] you&#8217;re worried about your electricity staying on this month, then your salary is too low. If you&#8217;re saving $10,000/mo, then your salary is probably higher than necessary,&#8221; investor Leo Polovets <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1365124742110355456">wrote</a> in a Twitter thread.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, a good test is to ask how you&#8217;ll feel if your startup fails: Will you wonder if your salary contributed to its fall? Or will you regret sacrificing more than you can recover?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This tweet is just one of many in a now burgeoning conversation about how founder pay needs to change. The startup and investor communities are beginning to realize that many founders can&#8217;t go without pay for months.</p>
<p>Founders of SaaS startups are at an advantage in this scenario as the sector now has many companies generating revenue almost from day one, sometimes without needing to raise any funding at all.</p>
<p>However, the success still doesn&#8217;t tell founders how much to pay themselves, or what others are doing. To help with this, we&#8217;ve gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.</p>
<h2>A framework for compensation</h2>
<p>Founder compensation is often referred to as a &#8220;founder salary,&#8221; but anchoring the conversation around the salary framework can create the wrong expectation. For example, you could try to establish a correlation between what you plan to pay yourself and your past or current value on the job market. Instead, the data we gathered indicates that founders typically take a pay cut from their previous salaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissosnowski/">Chris Sosnowski</a> is an interesting example: Before he “took the plunge” at the beginning of 2020 to work full time on his water data management startup <a href="https://www.waterlyapp.com/">Waterly</a>, he used to earn &#8220;well over&#8221; $100,000. But he says his previous salary wasn&#8217;t a key factor when he set his compensation. &#8220;I decided to pay myself based on what I thought it would take to keep the company running,&#8221; he wrote to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That brings to mind deferred compensation, which will be familiar to anyone who owns equity. Having put his own money into the company and owning the majority of it, Sosnowski is set to be compensated for his efforts if all goes well. &#8220;For the record, I do hope to pay myself back [a] salary for the year or so [it is] reduced like this,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2017, Paul Hawken published a book (<a href="https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework">Drawdown</a>) compiling a set of concrete actions people could take to combat climate change. Inspired by this, <a href="https://fiftyyears.com/team/seth-bannon">Seth Bannon</a>, founding partner at <a href="https://fiftyyears.com/">Fifty Years</a>, a firm that provides seed funding for companies aiming to make the world a better place, decided to do something similar to address systemic racism, and the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Racial-Inequity-Drawdown-RID-9d1136788f9c4647a7667b33b0e82b0a">Racial Inequity Drawdown</a> was born.</p>
<p>Today, the company is revealing this document to the world and &#8220;open sourcing&#8221; it with the goal of making the framework part of the conversation to address racial inequity in startup investing and in the broader world.</p>
<p>Bannon, like many people, was looking for ways to better understand the impact of racism in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder last year. He began to think about it, much like climate change, as a huge, multidimensional set of problems. He wanted to understand the scope of these problems to use his investment capital to help address some of these issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So we incubated the Racial Inequity Drawdown at Fifty Years and the reason we did is because we got excited about finding and funding companies that addressed racial inequity in the same way we do the climate crisis or disease or all these other things &#8212; and it&#8217;s really hard because it&#8217;s such a multidimensional issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a starting point, he decided to create a document similar to &#8220;Drawdown&#8221; that looked at these issues in a single place to help him and his firm understand the scope of the problem, and to help them look at their investments through a racial equity lens.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to pull together resources just for ourselves, so that we could have racial equity be a lens that we use for our own investing and we were like, &#8216;Oh my God, there&#8217;s a lot here.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>That led to one of the company&#8217;s fellows taking ownership of the project, with the goal of fleshing out a comprehensive document. The resulting framework is built on three pillars or broad sets of categories, including Health &amp; Wellbeing, Equality of Opportunity and Sustainable Systems, with each pillar including different elements of the racial inequity problem that need to be addressed. And each sub-category includes a detailed definition of the problem, key terms, a set of companies and organizations currently working on the issue and what still needs to be done (perhaps openings for startup ideas).</p>

<p>To make it more than a document created in-house, Bannon and his team wanted to take it a step further, so he brought in a group of college students to begin reaching out to communities of color to participate in this initiative and bring it to life.</p>
<p>One of those students is Elizabeth Poku, a rising sophomore at Princeton, who said she was drawn to the project as a way to flip the script on racism. &#8220;What I hope to do in the future is really hijack existing systems and structures that used to put down and oppress people and make sure we&#8217;re changing those narratives, changing those systems to really work for those that they were putting down,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>She saw Racial Inequity Drawdown as a way to help to do this and joined the team, helping to write some sections of the document, including the one on the impact of lack of access to healthcare on people of color. She says that the team then reached out to communities working on the problem and began to compile resources into a database, including startups that have been working to solve the different elements documented in the framework.</p>

<p>Bannon says that investors who want to build racial equity as a lens into their investment process can use this document as a guide, and it also acts as a signal that a firm cares about this as it allocates resources to different startups, certainly that&#8217;s the case for Fifty Years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of this for us was just defining what that means, and now we have a really great start here. And then second is letting entrepreneurs know that we care about racial equity as a lens, and that if you are addressing racial equity, that&#8217;s going to be a big plus in our book.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Obviously, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re definitely going to be able to fund you, but that&#8217;s going to be a big plus, and we&#8217;re excited about that and attacking racial inequity through technology and entrepreneurship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm sees today&#8217;s launch as a starting point, one that others can build on and add to the conversation, and build on this initial framework. At the same time, it gives members of the startup ecosystem, whether that&#8217;s entrepreneurs or investors, a way to start looking at their investments or projects through this racial equity lens.</p>

<p>&#8220;We really want to make this drawdown start the conversation and make sure this is at the forefront of people&#8217;s minds. That&#8217;s our main goal. So yes, if that includes helping community members really find out how they can [help] these startups get into the tech world, that&#8217;s definitely part of our mission,&#8221; Poku explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myzeller.com/">Zeller</a>, a Melbourne-based fintech founded by former Square executives to serve small- to mid-sized businesses, has raised $50 million AUD (about $37.5 million USD) led by Spark Capital, the investment firm whose portfolio also includes Twitter, Slack and Coinbase. Zeller&#8217;s valuation is now $400 million AUD (about $301 million USD).</p>
<p>The funding included participation from returning investors Square Peg, Apex Capital Partners and Addition, and brings Zeller’s total raised in under a year to $81 million AUD. This amount includes a pre-launch Series A led by Addition, the investment firm started by Lee Fixel, and seed funding.</p>

<p>Zeller was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square’s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, the fintech’s former strategy and growth lead. The company <a href="https://www.myzeller.com/about/press/zeller-launches-new-business-banking-alternative-for-underserved-australian-businesses">launched its first products for small businesses on May 4</a>, including EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point of sale) terminals, business accounts and cards.</p>
<p>The company says more than 1,500 Australian businesses signed up in the month after its launch, and weekly payment volume has been growing 200%. About 80% of businesses who started using Zeller switched from Australia’s four biggest banks, citing their desire for lower fees and better customer support.</p>
<p>Zeller’s new funding will be used to grow its research and engineering hub, including filling 18 new engineering roles that will support Zeller’s plan to become a fully-regulated business bank.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Spark Capital investor James Kuklinski said, “From our first meeting with Ben, we knew we wanted to be a part of Zeller. Australia’s business banking landscape is dominated by a small group of incumbents, and is ripe for disruption through simpler, more transparent pricing, best-in-class technology and better customer service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a million people migrate to the U.S. each year. Upon their arrival, they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">face challenges in opening a local bank account</a> and accessing financial services at regular rates.</p>
<p>These challenges for migrants, a significant portion of whom also need to send money home, have persisted globally for decades, despite <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-sent-billions-of-dollars-home-amid-covid-19-economic-hardships-11620834545">large government support programs</a>.</p>
<p>Now an entrepreneur, who in his previous venture fought exorbitant phone tariff charges to help people make phone calls at low-cost, believes he has found the solution &#8212; and definitely a vote of confidence from investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.majority.com/en/">MAJORITY</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $19 million in its seed funding. The financial round was led by Valar Ventures while Avid Ventures, Heartcore Capital and several prominent Nordic fintech unicorn founders participated in it.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup operates an eponymous mobile banking service. MAJORITY, whose name is a play on bringing financial inclusion to more people, runs a subscription service where it charges $5 a month to individuals and provides them with a range of financial services including an FDIC-insured bank account with early direct deposit at no overdraft fee, a debit card, mobile credit, and at-cost international phone calls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168598" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168598" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168598 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/majority-app.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168598" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Majority</p></div></p>
<p>Another reason why so many migrant communities are apprehensive of opening accounts with traditional banks, said Magnus Larsson (pictured above), founder and chief executive of MAJORITY, is that they don’t feel welcome there.</p>
<p>“You might not speak the language, or understand the cultural differences,” he said. To tackle this, MAJORITY has hired customer and sales relation representatives from various communities to work with customers to understand their needs.</p>
<p>Houston and Stockholm-headquartered MAJORITY also runs a community on its app to help individuals who have moved to the U.S. find familiar people and a “home” environment, he said. “Customers there find how to get a VISA as well as things like information about places to do local shopping,” he said.</p>
<p>“As veterans within the migrant tech sector, the team behind MAJORITY has already established themselves as builders of disruptive solutions for the world’s immigrants,” said James Fitzgerald, Founding Partner at Valar Ventures. “By supporting them for continued growth, we are confident that they will bring better and well-needed banking services to immigrants in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Starting today, the service is available in all 50 U.S. states and complies with local regulations, said Larsson, who previously served as the chief executive of Swedish technology firm Rebtel. Sutton Bank is MAJORITY&#8217;s banking partner.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the new funding to expand its product offerings and broaden its team of about 80 people currently. “Since we are a company of immigrants for immigrants, we also look forward to hiring diverse talent that exists within the different immigrant communities we serve. This is more important now than ever given that many have been hit hard by the pandemic,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As venues reopen across the U.S., Mixhalo has announced a pair of additions to its in-person audio live event audio streaming platform: Mixhalo Over Cellular and Mixhalo Rodeo.</p>
<p>The first is, more or less, what it sounds like. Rather than relying on Wi-Fi, the leverages 5G. The company says it will be able to offer a similar “ultra-low latency” that made the initial Wi-Fi product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/mixhalo-series-a/">so compelling</a>.</p>
<p>Mixhalo is working with a carrier to roll out the feature, but won’t say which. It notes, however, that while it would work with LTE, for obvious reasons, 5G provides a greater opportunity to decrease latency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rodeo, meanwhile, is designed to work with existing venue wireless to circumvent the need to install an additional overlay system.</p>
<p>“The Rodeo system actually reduces network strain since the existing access points are now aware of the Mixhalo traffic and can plan for and buffer network data accordingly,” CEO John Vars tells TechCrunch. “If a venue has installed a wireless system post-2015, they are likely to have the necessary hardware to support Rodeo in their venue. We do need to install a server in the venue’s server room, but that is the only hardware component of Rodeo.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168564" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=768,763 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=680,675 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=1536,1525 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combine_images.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mixhalo</p></div></p>
<p>Co-founded by Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger, Mixhalo launched its product onstage at Disrupt 2017 (with some help from Pharrell), promising to deliver live event sounds through its ultra-low latency streaming tech.</p>
<p>Naturally, 2020 and the first half of this year have been a pretty major trial for a startup so tied to live events. Vars tells TechCrunch that the company was forced to reduce headcount at the beginning of the pandemic as contracts were ended, but adds that the company has managed to grow since, in part on the strength of a number of partnerships.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1858964" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1858964" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1858964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg" alt="33880884864 9f2f7a02dc k" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33880884864_9f2f7a02dc_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1858964" class="wp-caption-text">NEW YORK, NY &#8211; MAY 17: (L-R) Pharrell Williams, Founder and CEO of MIXhalo Mike Einziger and TechCrunch senior writer Anthony Ha speak onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017 &#8211; Day 3 at Pier 36 on May 17, 2017 in New York City.

<p>“The silver lining in all of this is that we got a chance to step back and laser-focus on improving our core product,” says Vars. “These improvements include this announcement of Mixhalo Rodeo and Mixhalo over Cellular, as well as the capability to dynamically adjust latency based on physical position in the venue &#8212; we may not have had the time and opportunity to work on these improvements in the full swing of pre-pandemic business. With these new features, we’ve seen piqued interest from partners in the sports world and are excited to see this use case of Mixhalo really take off.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kairos, the startup studio led by Ankur Jain, is launching a new brand today called <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards</a>. Bilt is a rewards program that lets renters earn each time they make a rent payment.</p>
<p>The company is funded by Kairos, which is the studio that is also responsible for brands like Rhino, Alloy, and Little Spoon.</p>
<p>Bilt has two main pieces, a rewards platform and a credit card, powered by Mastercard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the rewards side, Bilt has partnered with estate owners and property managers including the Blackstone Group, The Related Companies and Equity Residential. Folks who rent with these entities can now earn rewards each time they pay their rent, with the opportunity to earn even more rewards for things like lease renewals or lease signing bonuses.</p>
<p>The co-branded <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/card">Bilt Mastercard</a> credit card allows renters at those properties, or any other renter, to pay their rent with the credit card. As a renter myself, and as one that is still forced to pay by check via snail mail, this is a welcome offering.</p>
<p>Folks who use the Bilt Mastercard will earn 2x points on rent payments and one point per dollar spent on the card elsewhere.</p>
<p>These points, whether earned through spending on the card or by paying rent at Bilt-partnered properties, can be used toward travel with airlines and hotels, as well as other perks like group fitness classes. But perhaps the most significant option for spending points is to use them toward a mortgage payment.</p>
<p>Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. So not only can people use their rewards points toward their down payment on a home, but folks using the Bilt Mastercard can also build their credit score and earn rewards at the same time, bringing down the rates on their mortgage.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, Bilt takes a cut of the transaction fee alongside Mastercard for purchases made through the Bilt credit card. The startup also generates revenue by charging property managers for the points they distribute to their tenants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years ago, if you asked us if we could bring together an alliance of property owners to work together under one unified rewards program, it would have been hard to imagine,&#8221; said Jain. &#8220;If you think about getting payment networks to collaborate on a credit card or fees on rent, most people would have said that&#8217;s not possible. Getting regulatory approval from the U.S. government was a huge hurdle we had to overcome. Building out every airline and hotel partnership was huge. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken three years. This has been the hardest project we&#8217;ve worked on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squad used to be an app that connected people with similar interests for in-person meetups. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. While most social apps thrived under these conditions &#8212; people craved digital connection more than ever &#8212; Squad couldn’t operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder <a href="https://www.isawatson.com/">Isa Watson</a> didn’t know how long the world would be in shutdown. Instead of waiting for a return to normalcy, she shifted the scope of the app entirely.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.withyoursquad.com/">Squad</a> relaunches as an audio-based social app that aims to help users deepen their relationship with their existing circle of close friends. Squad is an audio-only app, but don’t worry &#8212; it’s not another Clubhouse wannabe. Instead, it functions as a news feed of voice message updates from your closest friends, which expire after 24 hours.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add up to twelve friends to your “squad,” and once you post an update, your squad members can emoji react or send a private voice message in response &#8212; these also expire after a day, encouraging users to be more open about what they share. Soon, Squad will support phone calls, but there currently isn’t functionality for group calls or group audio messaging. But, users might be incentivized to talk on the phone via Squad rather than a typical call, since you can add a title to your call. That way, your squad member knows why you’re calling before they pick up. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168416" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168416" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168416" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168416" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a big gap in the social landscape, because most of the tools are discovery platforms, broadcast platforms, and personal branding platforms,” Watson said. “There’s a huge opportunity for us to come in and help people maintain stronger connections with the people that they enjoy the most.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a voice update feels more genuine than a curated Instagram shot or a crafted Facebook status update (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/is-facebook-dead-to-gen-z/">Facebook is decidedly uncool</a> among Gen Z and millennials). As the popularity of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">Dispo</a> show, young people are responding well to ephemeral, authentic social media experiences. But the audio-only medium could be a hard sell for people who aren’t already sending voice messages on WhatsApp or iMessage. However, while Squad’s initial rollout will be domestic, there’s great potential for an app like this outside of the US, where <a href="https://in.mashable.com/culture/11736/if-youre-not-voice-messaging-youre-missing-out-heres-how-to-do-it-right">voice messaging is more popular</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the conversations that would happen on text message are now happening in an asynchronous audio type of way,” Watson added. “So we expect that to continue to penetrate further into our habits.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2019, and she was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/raising-vc-in-silicon-valley-as-a-female-poc/">featured on TechCrunch</a> with advice on raising venture capital as a woman of color in Silicon Valley. Despite changing the direction of her app, her investors &#8212; which include Michael Dearing (Harrison Metal), Aaron Levie (Box), Katrina Lake (StichFix), Jen Rubio (Away), and Stewart Butterfield (Slack) &#8212; remain supportive. Watson secured another million dollars of funding after the seed round, bringing Squad’s funding to a total of $4.5 million to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing [the investors] said to me was, ‘Isa, you’ve been talking about this shift in social for years now, and people told you you were crazy, that social was all figured out and there was nothing that was going to happen,’” Watson said. “Now, people are buying into that change.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168418" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168418" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168418" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Squad isn’t a Clubhouse competitor, the rise of audio-only media is a good sign for the app’s ability to crack a saturated social market (so many social apps are trying to compete with Clubhouse, it’s a miracle we don’t yet have audio-only Tinder speed dating). In Squad’s beta test, 87.5% of users completed the onboarding process. Still, Squad falls victim to the same accessibility issues that plague Clubhouse and many of its clones. As of yet, Squad doesn’t support captioning, though Watson says this is something the company has discussed and hopes to implement down the road. Not only could captioning broaden Squad’s audience, but it could also further differentiate the app from messaging giants like iMessage and WhatsApp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if you’re someone who loves to send voice messages in your group chats, you might want to get your friends on Squad. Currently, the app is invite-only with a waitlist. Once you’re off the waitlist, you get three invites. If you post for five days straight, you get three more invites, and if someone you invited signs up, you get two more invites as well. This continues until you round out your twelve-member squad. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might well have a sleep app that tracks your sleep. I use <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle</a>, and have found it has started to even tell me when I cough during the night. It turns out you can run machine learning over how you might cough in the night, to detect changes in the way you cough. That data could inform people with ongoing respiratory illnesses and help them manage their health.</p>
<p>This is part of the idea behind NuvoAir, which uses both an app to listen to your night-time coughing and other health data to do just that.</p>
<p>The Boston-based startup has now raised $12 million in a Series A funding led by London-based AlbionVC, </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps because the COVID-19 pandemic made people more aware of respiratory complaints, NuvoAir claims it experienced 500% growth in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The round was also participated in by KAYA (formerly Enern), Amino Collective and existing shareholders Spiltan, Industrifonden and Novartis Pharma AG (dRx Capital).</p>
<p>How NuvoAir ai works is by combining the data from a Bluetooth-enabled spirometer that remotely monitors lung function; a sensor that attaches to asthma and COPD inhalers; and an integration with Fitbit devices. It also includes data from <a href="https://www.nuvoair.com/blog/nuvoair-home-platform-expands-to-include-cough-data">NuvoAir Cough</a>, which assesses changes in nighttime coughing.</p>
<p>Its business model is enabling health plans, insurance companies, and healthcare systems to reduce the cost of managing their most severe respiratory patients, and also managing the care they provide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s able to be used in the clinical trial business, where it licenses the technology to pharma companies or contract research organizations on a per user basis.</p>
<p>NuvoAir says over 500 million people globally suffer from chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And it costs around $300 billion a year to manage these conditions.  The company claims its solution reduces urgent consultations by more than 39%.</p>
<p>In some way, NuvoAir is comparable to companies like Livongo (tracks Diabetes, raised $235M) and Omada Health (tracks chronic illness, raised $256.5M). All these companies are using increasing amounts of data about our health to manage ongoing illnesses.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to accelerate the expansion of the NuvoAir digital care platform in the US and Europe; advance the development of new products and services; and support NuvoAir’s partner and customer base for decentralized clinical trials around the world.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Consoli, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NuvoAir told me: “As a child, I suffered from severe asthma. I was hospitalized a few times and my parents were really scared when that happened. My grandmother died because of COPD and other family members, unfortunately, had severe respiratory conditions as well. On top of that, my young son has asthma. So I have naturally been drawn to respiratory health and have always felt the current health systems are not designed to help patients on a day-to-day basis, but only when patients end up in the hospital, which is always too late. But honestly, it was only when, by chance, in 2012 I joined the digital health team of Novartis Respiratory Franchise that I realized how much technology and healthcare were meant to be together. It was an eye-opener for me to realize that certain digital biomarkers could tell whether patients were responding to treatment or predict whether they might be hospitalized&#8230; Equipped with those insights and with my prior experience as a patient, I decided in 2016 to take on the challenge of improving respiratory health, and NuvoAir was born.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christoph Ruedig, Partner at AlbionVC said: “We&#8217;re proud to be able to support NuvoAir, one of the few digital health companies active in both Europe and the US. The company has built an impressive respiratory disease management ecosystem with strong clinical evidence and a scalable care model that benefits patients, payers and providers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.g2.com/">G2</a>, a company that provides an online software review and information database, announced that it has raised a $157 million Series D. Per a release the company shared with TechCrunch in advance of its news, G2 is now worth more than $1 billion, making it a unicorn in modern parlance.</p>
<p>Permira led the round via its growth fund, while prior venture capital firms IVP, Emergence, and Accel also contributed. The investment also included capital from LinkedIn, which previously invested, and corporate venture dollars from both HubSpot and Salesforce.</p>
<p>The round caught our eye not due to its scale &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/">nine-figure rounds are a daily occurrence in today&#8217;s super-heated venture capital market</a> &#8212; but due to the interesting position that G2 and its rivals occupy in the technology space. They provide a guide of sorts to various software niches, not only exposing a number of competing services in a single space, but also some signal about what service might be a good pick.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">immensely deep</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/atlantas-singleops-raises-6m-for-its-outdoor-care-focused-software-business/">immensely wide</a> software market, offering potential buying entities &#8212; all companies, in other words &#8212; directions when it comes to software buying decisions is a position of power. And one that comes with a unique set of challenges.</p>
<p>G2 cannot simply provide lists of competing software products and user reviews. It needs to command a position of trust; if its users are worried that commercial interests are clouding its ratings and lists, the company&#8217;s core product could be compromised.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what TechCrunch asked G2 CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/godardabel?lang=en">Godard Abel</a> to discuss.</p>
<p>In response to our question regarding balancing G2&#8217;s commercial interests and review purity, Abel said that &#8220;whether a software vendor pays G2 or not has no impact on their rating on G2 and their placement in our category rankings which are 100% algorithmic and data-driven.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good start.</p>
<p>Abel went on to say that G2 verifies all reviews, checks the &#8220;business identity&#8221; of reviewers via their online profiles, and uses &#8220;NLP and AI to score and validate all reviews including preventing any reviews by competitors or employees of a vendor.&#8221; And, the CEO added, G2 has humans in the loop for verification as well.</p>
<p>The process seems reasonable, but the company and its rivals like <a href="https://www.capterra.com/">Capterra</a> will need to manage market trust as they continue to scale.</p>
<p>On that front, the CEO expanded a bit on the growth metrics that it disclosed as part of its release. In that document the company said that it added &#8220;700 paying customers for its Marketing Solutions in the past 12 months.&#8221; TechCrunch wanted to know what percent growth that number represented, and what portion of G2&#8217;s revenues come from that particular business line.</p>
<p>Per Abel, the customer number represented a 45% growth rate, and that that &#8220;piece of [its] business represents the bulk of [its] current revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parsing that a little, seeing 45% customer growth in a majority revenue line implies healthy growth. We lack several data points that we&#8217;d need to convert that customer growth figure into revenue expansion itself, sadly.</p>
<p>With lots of new cash in the bank, G2 has plenty of space to keep growing. Its CEO highlighted international investment as a place where he intends to invest, citing &#8220;exceptionally strong growth across Europe and Asia as our international software buyer traffic and revenue have been nearly doubling.&#8221; And Abel said that his company will also &#8220;accelerate&#8221; its coverage of the software market with its new capital, along with investments into data work to improve G2&#8217;s recommendation engine.</p>
<p>G2 itself is now valued like a company that&#8217;s on an IPO path, which means that the standards we&#8217;ll hold it to have reached their zenith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time is your most valuable asset &#8212; as the saying goes &#8212; and today a startup called <a href="https://memory.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memory.ai</a>, which is building AI-based productivity tools to help you with your own time management, is announcing some funding to double down on its ambitions: it wants not only to help manage your time, but to, essentially, provide ways to use it better in the future.</p>
<p>The startup, based out of Oslo, Norway, initially made its name with an app called <a href="https://memory.ai/timely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timely</a>, a tool for people to track time spent doing different tasks. aimed not just at people who are quantified self geeks, but those who need to track time for practical reasons, such as consultants or others who work on the concept of billable hours. Timely has racked up 500,000 users since 2014, including more than 5,000 paying businesses in 160 countries.</p>
<p>Now, Memory.ai has raised $14 million as it gears up to launch its next apps, <a href="https://memory.ai/dewo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dewo</a> (pronounced &#8220;De-Voh&#8221;), an app that is meant to help people do more &#8220;deep work&#8221; by learning about what they are working on and filtering out distractions to focus better; and <a href="https://memory.ai/glue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glue</a>, described as a knowledge hub to help in the creative process. Both are due to be released later in the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by local investors Melesio and Sanden, with participation from Investinor, Concentric and SNÖ Ventures, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/memory-timely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed Memory.ai previously</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity apps&#8221; has always been something of a nebulous category in the world of connected work. They can variously cover any kind of collaboration management software ranging from Asana and Jira through to Slack and Notion; or software that makes doing an existing work task more efficiently than you did it before (eg Microsoft has described all of what goes into Microsoft 365 &#8212; Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc. &#8212; as &#8220;productivity apps&#8221;); or, yes, apps like those from Memory.ai that aim to improve your concentration or time management.</p>
<p>These days, however, it feels like the worlds of AI and advances in mobile computing are increasingly coming together to evolve that concept once again.</p>
<p>If the first wave of smartphone communications and the apps that are run on smartphone devices &#8212; social, gaming, productivity, media, information, etc. &#8212; have led to us getting pinged by a huge amount of data from lots of different places, all of the time, then could it be that the second wave is quite possibly going to usher in a newer wave of tools to handle all that better, built on the premise that not everything is of equal importance? No-mo FOMO? We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>In any case, some bigger platform players also helping to push the agenda of what productivity means in this day and age.</p>
<p>For example, in Apple&#8217;s recent preview of iOS 15 (due to come out later this year) the company gave a supercharge to its existing &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; feature on its phones, where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off a new Focus mode</a>, letting users customize how and when they want to receive notifications from which apps, and even which apps they want to have displayed, all organized by different times of day (eg work time), place, calendar items, and so on.</p>

It feels, in any case, like it could be the start of something.</p>
<p>And, serendipitously &#8212; or maybe because this is some kind of zeitgeist &#8212; this is also playing<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> into what Memory.ai has built and is building. </span></p>
<p>Mathias Mikkelsen, the Oslo-based founder of Memory.ai, first came up for his idea for Timely (which had also been the original name of the whole startup) when he was working as a designer in the ad industry, one of those jobs that needed to track what he was working on, and for how long, in order to get paid.</p>
<p>He said he knew the whole system as it existed was inefficient: &#8220;I just thought it was insane how cumbersome and old it was. But at the same time how important it was for the task,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The guy had an entrepreneurial itch that he was keen to scratch, and this idea would become the salve to help him. Mikkelsen was so taken with building a startup around time management, that he sold his apartment in Oslo and moved himself to San Francisco to be where he believed was the epicenter of startup innovation. He tells me he lived off the proceeds of his flat for two years &#8220;in a closet&#8221; in a hacker house, bootstrapping Timely, until eventually getting into an accelerator (500 Startups) and subsequently starting to raise money. He eventually moved back to Oslo after two years to continue growing the business, as well as to live somewhere a little more spacious.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s big technical breakthrough with Timely was to figure out an efficient way of tracking time for different tasks, not just time worked on anything, without people having to go through a lot of data entry.</p>
<p>The solution: to integrate with a person&#8217;s computer, plus a basic to-do schedule for a day or week, and then match up which files are open when to determine how long one works for one client or another. Phone or messaging conversations, for the moment, are not included, and neither are the contents of documents &#8212; just the titles of them. Nor is data coming from wearable devices, although you could see how that, too, might prove useful.</p>
<p>The basic premise is to be personalised, so managers and others cannot use Timely to track exactly what people are doing, although they can track and bill for those billable hours. All this is important, as it also will feed into how DeWo and Glue will work.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s big conceptual breakthrough came around the same time: Getting time tracking or any productivity right &#8220;has never been a UI problem,&#8221; Mikkelsen said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a human nature problem.&#8221; This is where the AI comes in, to nudge people towards something they identify as important, and nudge them away from work that might not contribute to that. Tackling bigger issues beyond time are essential to improving productivity overall, which is why Memory.ai now wants to extend to apps for carving out time for deep thinking and creative thinking.</p>
<p>While it might seem to be a threat that a company like Apple has identified the same time management predicament that Memory.ai has, and is looking to solve that itself, Mikkelsen is not fazed. He said he thinks of Focus as not unlike Apple&#8217;s work on Health: there will be ways of feeding information into Apple&#8217;s tool to make it work better for the user, and so that will be Memory.ai&#8217;s opportunity to hopefully grow, not cannibalize, its own audience with Timely and its two new apps. It is, in a sense, a timely disruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Memory’s proven software is already redefining how businesses around the world track, plan and manage their time. We look forward to working with the team to help new markets profit from the efficiencies, insights and transparency of a Memory-enabled workforce,&#8221; said Arild Engh, a partner at Melesio, in a statement.</p>
<p>Kjartan Rist,  a partner at Concentric, added: “We continue to be impressed with Memory’s vision to build and launch best-in-class products for the global marketplace. The company is well on its way to becoming a world leader in workplace productivity and collaboration, particularly in light of the remote and hybrid working revolution of the last 12 months. We look forward to supporting Mathias and the team in this exciting new chapter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuljeev-singh-1299a657/"> Kuljeev Singh</a> has had a three-course meal in the restaurant business. He was an angel investor in ChefHero, a part-time owner in an Australian-style meat pie shop, and now, is the founder of <a href="https://www.getresq.com/">ResQ</a>, a startup that helps restaurants repair and service their equipment through contractor work.</p>
<p>Sitting at multiple seats at the table showed Singh the “unfortunate reality of what it takes to run a restaurant. Weeks into buying that meat pie shop, Singh watched tens of thousands of dollars burn due to failing equipment and contractor issues.</p>
<p>“I realized [that] I have so much support at the front of the house to drive revenue to the door, but I have no technology to support the back of the house,” he said. Singh soon realized that his pain point was shared by many other restaurant owners, which seeded the idea for ResQ, a startup all about optimizing the back of the house, or non-customer facing, operation for restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ResQ announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by Homebrew, Golden Ventures, and Inovia Capital. Participating angel investors include Nilam Ganenthiran, president at Instacart; Gokul Rajaram, Doordash executive and board member of Pinterest and Coinbase, as well as customers, including Soul Foods, a global franchisee of Yum! Brands. ResQ has now raised $9 million in known venture capital to date.</p>
<p>The capital will primarily help ResQ double or triple its 60-person team across engineering, sales, and operation roles. The company will also earmark money toward launching in new markets, building atop its current presence in San Francisco, LA, Dallas, Chicago, and Phoenix.</p>
<h2>SaaS-enabled marketplace</h2>
<p>ResQ’s business is split into two parts: a software platform and contractor marketplace.</p>
<p>The platform allows restaurants to request, manage, and pay for a service that they need done, from plumbing issues to electrical mishaps. ResQ claims it can save restaurants between 10-30% in annual repairs by offering competitive rates, and faster communication and hiring loops. It charges a monthly SaaS fee per rooftop to a restaurant group.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168513" style="width: 638px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168513" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2168513" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png" alt="" width="628" height="629" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png 1315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168513" class="wp-caption-text">ResQ product mock-up.</p></div></p>
<p>The software layer sits on top of ResQ’s contractor marketplace, which is essentially a supply of geographic-specific workers with a variety of specialties that can come to do repairs or management. In exchange for providing contractors with work, ResQ takes a portion of revenue they make from each service. Singh sees the marketplace business of ResQ as a differentiator from incumbents or startup competitors such as ServiceChannel.</p>
<p>“You don’t just need a fancy-looking piece of software,” Singh said. “You need a product that can manage vendors, that can make sure they show up on time, that can make sure that they&#8217;re not overcharging, so that’s why we&#8217;re a SaaS enabled marketplace in the background.” By owning the supply side of the repair market, ResQ can have more precision when meeting demand and understanding its end customer.</p>
<p>Of course, a challenge with any marketplace is balancing and sourcing a high-quality supply. ResQ has over 700 contractors on its platform right now, but it needs to continue building them up in order to meet needs and get restaurant services on time. Singh said that a majority of its contractor supply comes from its restaurant customers bringing on preferred partners to their platform. ResQ then backfills, he said, any gaps in supply or if there are any specialties that are missing. While that process may be convenient for now, the startup could eventually scale &#8211; and sweeten the deal &#8211; by generating its own supply of contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a>, partner at <a href="https://homebrew.co/">Homebrew</a>, thinks that ResQ could eventually use its positioning as a marketplace to bring on edtech and fintech services to contractors. For example, it has plans to eventually turn into a skills provider to train and place local talent. ResQ also wants to turn into a &#8220;business in a box&#8221; for these contractors, helping them grow their business through payment and billing support.</p>
<p>“For me that&#8217;s the difference between ‘you&#8217;re just making things more efficient’ versus ‘you’re also giving some percentage of your worker base the chance to think in new ways about the services they provide,” Walk said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re just thinking about it as an as a optimization algorithm, then you&#8217;re never really going to get into the &#8216;what can I do to help make these people&#8217;s lives better&#8217; and those are where some of the upside of the economics live as well.&#8221; He noted that Singh’s experience, and ethos as a founder, will lead to ResQ solving problems more holistically and humanly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168512" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168512" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2168512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg" alt="Resq-kuljeev-singh" width="580" height="870" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168512" class="wp-caption-text">ResQ founder Kuljeev Singh</p></div></p>
<h2>The market</h2>
<p>Even with successful operations, margins can be razor-thin in the restaurant industry. This reality puts any startup in the restaurant tech industry at risk: when costs need to be cut, SaaS tools could be the first to go. Toast, for example, initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/restaurant-management-platform-toast-cuts-50-of-staff/">cut 50% of its staff</a> due to the economic impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For ResQ, the pandemic created new urgency around rebuilding tech-forward restaurants, Singh said.</p>
<p>“We started building a new paradigm to our product and transitioned from a transactional marketplace mobile only focused on smaller restaurants, to a fully SaaS product focused on multi-unit operators powered by a local marketplace,” Singh said. Surely enough, the company’s revenue grew 750% over the past year.</p>
<p>To date, ResQ has worked with over 3,000 restaurant groups including KFC, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons. With millions in the bank, let&#8217;s hope that number grows and it continues to find ways to grow its back of the house footprint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU antitrust authorities are finally taking a broad and deep look into Google&#8217;s adtech stack and role in the online ad market &#8212; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3143">confirming today</a> that they&#8217;ve opened a formal investigation.</p>
<p>Google has already been subject to three major EU antitrust enforcements over the past five years &#8212; against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Google Shopping</a> (2017), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a> (2018) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">AdSense</a> (2019). But the European Commission has, until now, avoided officially wading into the broader issue of its role in the adtech supply chain. (The AdSense investigation focused on Google&#8217;s search ad brokering business, though Google claims the latest probe represents that next stage of that 2019 enquiry, rather than stemming from a new complaint).</p>
<p>The Commission said that the new Google antitrust investigation will assess whether it has violated EU competition rules by &#8220;favouring its own online display advertising technology services in the so called &#8216;ad tech&#8217; supply chain, to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Display advertising spending in the EU in 2019 was estimated to be approximately €20BN, per the Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by restricting access by third parties to user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use,&#8221; it added in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3143">press release</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">Earlier this month</a>, France&#8217;s competition watchdog fined Google $268M in a case related to self-preferencing within the adtech market &#8212; which the watchdog found constituted an abuse by Google of a dominant position for ad servers for website publishers and mobile apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France fines Google $268M for adtech abuses and gets interoperability commitments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/embed/#?secret=6aQMgYSH7V" data-secret="6aQMgYSH7V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In that instance Google sought a settlement &#8212; proposing a number of binding interoperability agreements which the watchdog accepted. So it remains to be seen whether the tech giant may seek to push for a similar outcome at the EU level.</p>
<p>There is one cautionary signal in that respect in the Commission&#8217;s press release which makes a point of flagging up EU data protection rules &#8212; and highlighting the need to take into account the protection of &#8220;user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting side-note for the EU&#8217;s antitrust division to include, given some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1402314799015370755">criticism</a> that France&#8217;s Google adtech settlement has attracted &#8212; for risking cementing abusive user exploitation (in the form of adtech privacy violations) into the sought for online advertising market rebalancing.</p>
<p>Or as <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1402314799015370755">Cory Doctorow neatly explains it in this Twitter thread</a>: &#8220;The last thing we want is competition in practices that harm the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aka, unless competition authorities wise up to the data abuses being perpetuated by dominant tech platforms &#8212; such as through enlightened competition authorities engaging in close joint-working with privacy regulators (in the EU this is, at least, possible since there&#8217;s regulation in both areas) &#8212; there&#8217;s a very real risk that antitrust enforcement against Big (ad)Tech could simply supercharge the user-hostile privacy abuses that surveillance giants have only been able to get away with because of their market muscle.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr, ill-thought through antitrust enforcement actually risks <em>further eroding web users&#8217; rights</em>&#8230; and that would indeed be a terrible outcome. (Unless you&#8217;re Google; then it would represent successfully playing one regulator off against another at the expense of users.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The need for competition and privacy regulators to work together to purge Big Tech market abuses has become an active debate in Europe &#8212; where a few pioneering regulators (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">like German&#8217;s FCO</a>) are ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) also recently put out a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf">joint statement</a> &#8212; laying out their conviction that antitrust and data protection regulators must work together to foster a thriving digital economy that&#8217;s healthy across all dimensions &#8212; i.e. for competitors, yes, but also for consumers.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">CMA proposed settlement related to Google&#8217;s planned replacement for tracking cookies</a> &#8212; aka &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;, which has also been the target of antitrust complaints by publishers &#8212; was notable in baking in privacy commitments and data protection oversight by the ICO in addition to the CMA carrying out its competition enforcement role.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the European Commission has lagged behind such pioneers in appreciating the need for synergistic regulatory joint-working, with the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief roundly ignoring &#8212; for example &#8212; calls to block Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit over the data advantage it would entrench, in favor of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/"> accepting a few &#8216;concessions&#8217;</a> to waive the deal through.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting to see the EU&#8217;s antitrust division here and now &#8212; at the very least &#8212; <em>virtue signalling</em> an awareness of the problem of regional regulators approaching competition and privacy as if they exist in firewalled silos.</p>
<p>Whether this augurs the kind of enlightened regulatory joint working &#8212; to achieve holistically healthy and dynamic digital markets &#8212; which will certainly be essential if the EU is to effectively grapple with surveillance capitalism very much remains to be seen. But we can at least say that the inclusion of the below statement in an EU antitrust division press release represents a change of tone (and that, in itself, looks like a step forward&#8230;):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Competition law and data protection laws must work hand in hand to ensure that display advertising markets operate on a level playing field in which all market participants protect user privacy in the same manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to the specifics of the EU&#8217;s Google adtech probe, the Commission says it will be particularly examining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obligation to use Google&#8217;s services Display &amp; Video 360 (‘DV360&#8242;) and/or Google Ads to purchase online display advertisements on YouTube.</li>
<li>The obligation to use Google Ad Manager to serve online display advertisements on YouTube, and potential restrictions placed by Google on the way in which services competing with Google Ad Manager are able to serve online display advertisements on YouTube.</li>
<li>The apparent favouring of Google&#8217;s ad exchange “AdX” by DV360 and/or Google Ads and the potential favouring of DV360 and/or Google Ads by AdX.</li>
<li>The restrictions placed by Google on the ability of third parties, such as advertisers, publishers or competing online display advertising intermediaries, to access data about user identity or user behaviour which is available to Google&#8217;s own advertising intermediation services, including the Doubleclick ID.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party ‘cookies&#8217; on Chrome and replace them with the “Privacy Sandbox” set of tools, including the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s announced plans to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android smart mobile devices when a user opts out of personalised advertising, and the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commenting on the investigation in a statement, Commission EVP and competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Online advertising services are at the heart of how Google and publishers monetise their online services. Google collects data to be used for targeted advertising purposes, it sells advertising space and also acts as an online advertising intermediary. So Google is present at almost all levels of the supply chain for online display advertising. We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete in the so-called ad tech stack. A level playing field is of the essence for everyone in the supply chain. Fair competition is important &#8212; both for advertisers to reach consumers on publishers&#8217; sites and for publishers to sell their space to advertisers, to generate revenues and funding for content. We will also be looking at Google&#8217;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Contacted for comment on the Commission investigation, a Google spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day. They choose them because they’re competitive and effective. We will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission to answer their questions and demonstrate the benefits of our products to European businesses and consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Google also claimed that publishers keep around 70% of the revenue when using its products &#8212; saying in some instances it can be more.</p>
<p>It also suggested that publishers and advertisers often use multiple technologies simultaneously, further claiming that it builds its own technologies to be interoperable with more than 700 rival platforms for advertisers and 80 rival platforms for publishers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine, an AI-based platform for drug development and discovery announced $255 million in Series C financing on Tuesday. The massive round is reflective of a recent breakthrough for the company: proof that it’s AI based platform can create a new target for a disease, develop a bespoke molecule to address it, and begin the clinical trial process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also yet another indicator that AI and drug discovery continues to be especially attractive for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine is a Hong Kong-based company founded in 2014 around one central premise: that AI assisted systems can identify novel drug targets for untreated diseases, assist in the development of new treatments, and eventually predict how well those treatments may perform in clinical trials. Previously, the company had raised $51.3 million in funding, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/insilico-medicine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine’s aim to use AI to drive drug development isn’t particularly new, but there is some data to suggest that the company might actually accomplish that gauntlet of discovery all the way through trial prediction. In 2020, the company identified a novel drug target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease in which tiny air sacs in the lungs become scarred, which makes breathing laborious. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2vDXjnP3hF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=2vDXjnP3hF" data-secret="2vDXjnP3hF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://insilico.com/blog/pcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two AI-based platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first identified 20 potential targets, narrowed it down to one, and then designed a small molecule treatment that showed promise in animal studies. The company is currently filing an investigational new drug application with the FDA and will begin human dosing this year, with aims to begin a clinical trial late this year or early next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus here isn’t on the drug, though, it’s on the process. This project condensed the process of preclinical drug development that typically takes multiple years and hundreds of millions of dollars into just 18 months, for a total cost of about $2.6 million. Still, founder Alex Zhavoronkov doesn’t think that Insilico Medicine’s strengths lie primarily in accelerating preclinical drug development or reducing costs: its main appeal is in eliminating an element of guesswork in drug discovery, he suggests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Currently we have 16 therapeutic assets, not just IPF,” he says. “It definitely raised some eyebrows.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s about the probability of success,” he continues. “So the probability of success of connecting the right target to the right disease with a great molecule is very, very low. The fact that we managed to do it in IPF and other diseases I can’t talk about yet – it increases confidence in AI in general.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstered partially by the proof-of-concept developed by the IPF project and enthusiasm around AI based drug development, Insilico Medicine attracted a long list of investors in this most recent round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is led by Warburg Pincus, but also includes investment from Qiming Venture Partners, Pavilion Capital, Eight Roads Ventures, Lilly Asia Ventures, Sinovation Ventures, BOLD Capital Partners, Formic Ventures, Baidu Ventures, and new investors. Those include CPE, OrbiMed, Mirae Asset Capital, B Capital Group, Deerfield Management, Maison Capital, Lake Bleu Capital, President International Development Corporation, Sequoia Capital China and Sage Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This current round was oversubscribed four-fold, according to Zhavoronkov. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762311"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 63 drugs approved by the FDA between 2009 and 2018 found that the median capitalized research and development investment needed to bring a drug to market was $985 million, which also includes the cost of failed clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those costs and the low likelihood of getting a drug approved has initially slowed the process of drug development. R&amp;D returns for biopharmaceuticals hit a low of 1.6 percent in 2019, and bounced back to a measly 2.5 percent in 2020 according to a 2021 </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/deloitte-uk-measuring-the-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2021.pdf#page=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, Zhavoronkov imagines an AI-based platform trained on rich data that can cut down on the amount of failed trials. There are two major pieces of that puzzle: PandaOmics, an AI platform that can identify those targets; and Chemistry 42, a platform that can manufacture a molecule to bind to that target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a tool, which incorporates more than 60 philosophies for target discovery,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are betting something that is novel, but at the same time you have some pockets of evidence that strengthen your hypothesis. That’s what our AI does very well.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the IPF project has not been fully published in a peer-reviewed journal, a similar project </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0224-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Biotechnology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was. In that paper, Insilco’s deep learning model was able to identify potential compounds in just </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0224-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IPF project is a scale-up of this idea. Zhavoronkov doesn’t just want to identify molecules for known targets, he wants to find new ones and shepherd them all the way through clinical trials. And, indeed, also to continue to collect data during those clinical trials that might improve future drug discovery projects. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Insilico Medicine’s approach to novel target discovery has been used piecemeal, too. For instance, Insilico Medicine has collaborated with Pfizer on novel target discovery, and Johnson and Johnson on small molecule design and </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/insilico-partners-with-taisho-on-end-to-end-ai-powered-senolytic-drug-discovery-847530402.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">done both</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Taisho Pharmaceuticals. Today, the company also announced a new partnership with Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&amp;D, Inc. Teva will aim to use PandaOmics to identify new drug targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it’s not just Insilico Medicine raking in money and partnerships. The whole field of AI-based novel targets has been experiencing significant hype.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03846-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted that at least 20 partnerships between major drug companies and AI drug discovery tech companies had been reported. In 2020, investment in AI companies pursuing drug development increased to $13.9 billion, a four-fold increase from 2019, per Stanford University’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence Index </span></i><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> R&amp;D cost </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug discovery projects received the greatest amount of private AI investment in 2020, a trend that can partially be attributed to the pandemic’s need for rapid drug development. However, the roots of the hype predate Covid-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhavorokov is aware that AI based drug development is riding a bit of a hype wave right now. “Companies without substantial evidence supporting their AI powered drug discovery claims manage to raise very quickly,” he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine, he says, can distinguish itself based on the quality of its investors. “Our investors don&#8217;t gamble,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like so many other AI-based drug discovery platforms, we’ll have to see whether they make it through the clinical trial churn. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) published its <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/edpb_recommendations_202001vo.2.0_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf">final recommendations</a> yesterday setting on guidance for making transfers of personal data to third countries to comply with EU data protection rules in light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last summer&#8217;s landmark CJEU ruling</a> (aka Schrems II).</p>
<p>The long and short of these recommendations &#8212; which are fairly long; running to 48 pages &#8212; is that some data transfers to third countries will simply not be possible to (legally) carry out. Despite the continued existence of legal mechanisms that can, in theory, be used to make such transfers (like Standard Contractual Clauses; a transfer tool that was <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847">recently updated</a> by the Commission).</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s up to the data controller to assess the viability of each transfer, on a case by case basis, to determine whether data can legally flow in that particular case. (Which may mean, for example, a business making complex assessments about foreign government surveillance regimes and how they impinge upon its specific operations.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies that routinely take EU users&#8217; data outside the bloc for processing in third countries (like the US), which do not have data adequacy arrangements with the EU, face substantial cost and challenge in attaining compliance &#8212; in a best case scenario.</p>
<p>Those that can&#8217;t apply viable &#8216;special measures&#8217; to ensure transferred data is safe are duty bound to suspend data flows &#8212; with the risk, should they fail to do that, of being ordered to by a data protection authority (which could also apply additional sanctions).</p>
<p>One alternative option could be for such a firm to store and process EU users&#8217; data locally &#8212; within the EU. But clearly that won&#8217;t be viable for every company.</p>
<p>Law firms are likely to be very happy with this outcome since there will be increased demand for legal advice as companies grapple with how to structure their data flows and adapt to a post-Schrems II world.</p>
<p>In some EU jurisdictions (such as Germany) data protection agencies are now actively carrying out compliance checks &#8212; so orders to suspend transfers are bound to follow.</p>
<p>While the European Data Protection Supervisor is busy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">scrutinizing EU institutions&#8217; own use of US cloud services giants</a> to see whether high level arrangements with tech giants like AWS and Microsoft pass muster or not.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU bodies&#8217; use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc&#8217;s privacy chief&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/embed/#?secret=tXdBmELC5q" data-secret="tXdBmELC5q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last summer the CJEU struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield &#8212; only a few years after the flagship adequacy arrangement was inked. The same core legal issues did for its predecessor, &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">Safe Harbor</a>&#8216;, though that had stood for some fifteen years. And since the demise of Privacy Shield the Commission has repeatedly warned there will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">no quick fix replacement this time</a>; nothing short of major reform of US surveillance law is likely to be required.</p>
<p>US and EU lawmakers remain in negotiations over a replacement EU-US data flows deal but a viable outcome that can stand up to legal challenge as the prior two agreements could not, may well require <em>years</em> of work, not months.</p>
<p>And that means EU-US data flows are facing legal uncertainty for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The UK, meanwhile, has just squeezed a data adequacy agreement out of the Commission &#8212; despite some loudly enunciated post-Brexit plans for regulatory divergence in the area of data protection.</p>
<p>If the UK follows through in ripping up key tenets of its inherited EU legal framework there&#8217;s a high chance it will also lose adequacy status in the coming years &#8212; meaning it too could face crippling barriers to EU data flows. (But for now it seems to have dodged that bullet.)</p>
<p>Data flows to other third countries that also lack an EU adequacy agreement &#8212; such as China and India &#8212; face the same ongoing legal uncertainty.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/embed/#?secret=6ofpNPqC1p" data-secret="6ofpNPqC1p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The backstory to the EU international data flows issues originates with a complaint &#8212; in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations about government mass surveillance programs, so more than seven years ago &#8212; made by the eponymous Max Schrems over what he argued were unsafe EU-US data flows.</p>
<p>Although his complaint was specifically targeted at Facebook&#8217;s business and called on the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) to use its enforcement powers and suspend Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data flows.</p>
<p>A regulatory dance of indecision followed which finally saw legal questions referred to Europe&#8217;s top court and &#8212; ultimately &#8212; the demise of the EU-US Privacy Shield. The CJEU ruling also put it beyond legal doubt that Member States&#8217; DPAs must step in and act when they suspect data is flowing to a location where the information is at risk.</p>
<p>Following the Schrems II ruling, the DPC (finally) sent Facebook a preliminary order to suspend its EU-US data flows last fall. Facebook immediately challenged the order in the Irish courts &#8212; seeking to block the move. But that challenge failed. And Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data flows are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">very much operating on borrowed time</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the platform&#8217;s subject to Section 702 of the US&#8217; FISA law, its options for applying &#8216;special measures&#8217; to supplement its EU data transfers look, well, limited to say the least.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t &#8212; for example &#8212; encrypt the data in a way that ensures it has no access to it (zero access encryption) since that&#8217;s not how Facebook&#8217;s advertising empire functions. And Schrems has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">previously suggested</a> Facebook will have to federate its service &#8212; and store EU users&#8217; information inside the EU &#8212; to fix its data transfer problem.</p>
<p>Safe to say, the costs and complexity of compliance for certain businesses like Facebook look massive.</p>
<p>But there will be compliance costs and complexity for thousands of businesses in the wake of the CJEU ruling. And in a recent <a href="https://alliedforstartups.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EU-US-Summit-II-LETTER-.pdf">open letter</a> to lawmakers ahead of an EU-US summit earlier this month, startup associations on both sides of the Atlantic urged policymakers to find ways to partner on regulatory standards alignment &#8212; writing that recent developments in the digital sphere, such as the invalidation of Privacy Shield, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">threaten to leave our ecosystems at a disadvantage in tough globally competitive markets&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Discussing the concerns with TechCrunch, Benedikt Blomeyer, director of EU policy for Allied for Startups, added: &#8220;Startups are global from day one and as such, a US startup has much to offer for EU consumers. Why is that despite increasingly interconnected markets, and more and more data protection laws coming into force, increasingly trade barriers are arising in the digital economy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Though asked if the startups backing the call for the EU and US to work towards reducing regulatory divergence are lobbying for anything as specific as US surveillance law reform at this stage of their campaign Blomeyer declined to comment for now.</p>

<p><span class="il">Commenting on the EDPB&#8217;s adoption of final recommendations,</span> chair Andrea Jelinek said: “The impact of Schrems II cannot be underestimated: Already international data flows are subject to much closer scrutiny from the supervisory authorities who are conducting investigations at their respective levels. The goal of the <span class="il">EDPB</span> Recommendations is to guide exporters in lawfully transferring personal data to third countries while guaranteeing that the data transferred is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;By clarifying some doubts expressed by stakeholders, and in particular the importance of examining the practices of public authorities in third countries, we want to make it easier for data exporters to know how to assess their transfers to third countries and to identify and implement effective supplementary measures where they are needed. The <span class="il">EDPB</span> will continue considering the effects of the <i>Schrems II</i> ruling and the comments received from stakeholders in its future guidance.”</p>
<p>The EDPB put out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">earlier guidance on Schrems II compliance</a> last year.</p>
<p>It said the main modifications between that earlier advice and its final recommendations include: &#8220;The emphasis on the importance of examining the practices of third country public authorities in the exporters’ legal assessment to determine whether the legislation and/or practices of the third country impinge &#8212; in practice &#8212; on the effectiveness of the Art. 46 GDPR transfer tool; the possibility that the exporter considers in its assessment the practical experience of the importer, among other elements and with certain caveats; and the clarification that the legislation of the third country of destination allowing its authorities to access the data transferred, even without the importer’s intervention, may also impinge on the effectiveness of the transfer tool&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the EDPB&#8217;s recommendations in a statement, law firm Linklaters dubbed the guidance &#8220;strict&#8221; &#8212; warning over the looming impact on businesses.</p>
<p>“There is little evidence of a pragmatic approach to these transfers and the EDPB seems entirely content if the conclusion is that the data must remain in the EU,&#8221; said Peter Church, a Counsel at the global law firm. &#8220;For example, before transferring personal data to third country (without adequate data protection laws) businesses must consider not only its law but how its law enforcement and national security agencies operate in practice. Given these activities are typically secretive and opaque, this type of analysis is likely to cost tens of thousands of euros and take time. It appears this analysis is needed even for relatively innocuous transfers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not clear how SMEs can be expected to comply with these requirements,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Given we now operate in a globalised society the EDPB, like King Canute, should consider the practical limitations on its power. The guidance will not turn back the tides of data washing back and forth across the world, but many businesses will really struggle to comply with these new requirements.&#8221;</p>
