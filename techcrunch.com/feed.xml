		Known for his seminal book "Crossing the Chasm," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreyamoore">Geoffrey Moore</a> is an author, speaker and adviser who splits his consulting time between startup companies in the <a href="https://wildcat.vc/">Wildcat Venture Partners</a> portfolio and established high-tech enterprises — including Salesforce, Microsoft, Autodesk, F5Networks, Gainsight, Google and Splunk.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bussgang, a co-founder and general partner at Flybridge Capital, recently wrote an Extra Crunch guest post that argued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/after-30-years-crossing-the-chasm-is-due-for-a-refresh/">it is time for a refresh when it comes to the technology adoption life cycle and the chasm</a>. His argument went as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>VCs in recent years have drastically underestimated the size of SAMs (serviceable addressable markets) for their startup investments because they were “trained to think only a portion of the SAM is obtainable within any reasonable window of time because of the chasm.”</li>
<li>The chasm is no longer the barrier it once was because businesses have finally understood that software is eating the world.</li>
<li>As a result, the early majority has joined up with the innovators and early adopters to create an expanded early market. Effectively, they have defected from the mainstream market to cross the chasm in the other direction, leaving only the late majority and the laggards on the other side.</li>
<li>That is why we now are seeing multiple instances of very large high-growth markets that appear to have no limit to their upside. There is no chasm to cross until much later in the life cycle, and it isn’t worth much effort to cross it then.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I agree with Jeff that we are seeing remarkable growth in technology adoption at levels that would have astonished investors from prior decades. In particular, I agree with him when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pandemic helped accelerate a global appreciation that digital innovation was no longer a luxury but a necessity. As such, companies could no longer wait around for new innovations to cross the chasm. Instead, everyone had to embrace change or be exposed to an existential competitive disadvantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this <strong><em>is</em></strong><em> </em>crossing the chasm! Pragmatic customers are being forced to adopt because they are under duress. It is not that they buy into the vision of software eating the world. It is because their very own lunches are being eaten. The pandemic created a flotilla of chasm-crossings because it unleashed a very real set of existential threats.</p>
<p>The key here is to understand the difference between two buying decision processes, one governed by visionaries and technology enthusiasts (the early adopters and innovators), the other by pragmatists (the early majority). The early group makes their decisions based on their own analyses. They do not look to others for corroborative support. Pragmatists do. Indeed, word-of-mouth endorsements are by far the most impactful input not only about what to buy and when but also from whom.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX launched 85 satellites for external customers, as well as three Starlink satellites, to orbit on Tuesday, marking the second successful launch of the company&#8217;s dedicated rideshare missions. While the Transporter-2 mission will deliver fewer objects to space than the first rideshare mission (the Transporter-1 sent up 143 satellites, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/spacex-sets-new-record-for-most-satellites-on-a-single-launch-with-latest-falcon-9-mission/">a new record</a>), it launched more mass to orbit overall.</p>
<p>The Transporter launches are part of the company’s rideshare business model. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/spacex-will-now-offer-dedicated-rideshare-launches-for-small-satellites/">Announced in 2019</a>, these missions split up the rocket’s payload capacity among multiple customers, resulting in lower costs for each – many of whom are smaller companies that may find the expenses associated with getting to orbit otherwise impossible to pay. SpaceX still ends up with a full launch and the revenue to operate it.</p>
<p>The Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at around 3:31 PM Eastern time. It’s the 20th Falcon 9 launch in 2021 and the first launch this year that featured the first stage returning to land onshore, rather than on a drone ship at sea. The first stage booster separated at around 3:34 PM ET and returned to Cape Canaveral and successfully landed around eight minutes after liftoff. This was its eighth flight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2172313" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172313" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172313" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/first-stage.gif" alt="" width="640" height="438" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172313" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.spacex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The mission includes nearly 10 customers, some of whom are launch service providers who are themselves organizing customer payloads – like Spaceflight Inc., which is launching 36 small satellites on behalf of 14 customers, as well as its electric propulsion vehicle dubbed Sherpa-LTE. It also includes the first satellite launch for space intelligence company Umbra and Loft Orbital’s “rideshare” satellites, YAM-2 and YAM-3, each of which are equipped with five independent sensors for separate customers.</p>
<p>As this was SpaceX’s 20th launch this year (and 127th mission to date), it’s pretty safe to assume that the company will far surpass last year’s record of 26 launches.</p>
<p>This was the second attempt of the Transporter-2 launch, which was originally scheduled for June 29. That launch was halted at T-11 seconds after a rotary aircraft entered the flight zone. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called the regulatory system broken in response.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic.</p>
<p>There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1409951549988782087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bmwiventures.com/">BMW i Ventures</a>, the venture capital arm of BMW Group, has announced a new $300 million fund to further its investment in technologies that make transportation, manufacturing and supply chains more sustainable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm doesn’t operate as a traditional corporate venture capital fund, but rather acts independently from BMW while being fully backed by the German automaker. Its previous </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bmw-i-ventures-moving-to-silicon-valley-with-500-million-1480454910"><span style="font-weight: 400;">€500 million (about $525 million at the time) fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was announced when the firm moved to Silicon Valley in 2016, is now at the end of its period for new investments. From now on, new investments will come from Fund II. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund I focused more on autonomous and digital vehicle technology, customer experience and advanced production. For example, autonomous truck company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/bmw-i-ventures-invests-in-autonomous-truck-technology-company-kodiak-robotics/">Kodiak Robotics, which last week announced an investment from BMW i Ventures</a>, was a part of this fund. Fund II will further emphasize sustainability and zero emissions in all the sectors that lead up to designing, manufacturing and building a car, rather than specifically investing in core car technology.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sustainable supply chain is one of the things we’re really interested in right now,” Marcus Behrendt, managing partner at BMW i Ventures, told TechCrunch. “BMW Corp has announced that it wants to significantly reduce its carbon footprint, and therefore it’s looking at all ways of producing this, not just emission from the vehicles, but also the emissions that are produced when manufacturing and developing the cars.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BMW i Ventures invests in autonomous truck technology company Kodiak Robotics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/bmw-i-ventures-invests-in-autonomous-truck-technology-company-kodiak-robotics/embed/#?secret=12aBt91rdW" data-secret="12aBt91rdW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW i Ventures started dipping its toes into such sustainable investments at the end of 2019, investing in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/sustainable-tech-developer-turntide-technologies-raises-225m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turntide Technologies</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a company developing a smart electric motor system, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid Power</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a solid-state battery technology company and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/looking-to-decarbonize-the-metal-industry-bill-gates-backed-boston-metal-raises-50-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Metal</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a company looking to decarbonize the metal industry. Its most recent investments, says Behrendt, are indicative of what Fund II will bring. The firm has already made its first investment out of the new fund with U.K.-based Motorway, a used car marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have two goals right now, so the first is the financial goal and that’s our most important driver,” Kasper Sage, managing partner at BMW i Ventures, told TechCrunch. “Certain CVCs out there don’t really care for the return on investment, they just get to benefit from the business deal that comes with the investment, which could actually hurt the business they’re investing in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to make the company as successful as we possibly can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW i Ventures’ second goal is to provide strategic value back to the “mothership,” or BMW Group in Munich. By mainly investing in early-stage companies, the firm has an early market signal that it can convey back to BMW. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some cases it’s just making them aware that this new technology exists and might be coming your way,” said Sage. “For example, we invested in Lime, so that’s micromobility, nothing that will ever make its way into a car. But it is important to understand that this is a part of the future of how people move from A to B.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behrendt and Sage both said BMW i Ventures has no intentions of acquiring any of its investments, but rather wants to be at the forefront of finding companies with high potential that can work with BMW or the rest of the industry in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage said the firm has had 12 exits so far, plus six public companies at the moment and one that recently filed for a S-1 and will soon be public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t need corporate buy-in to make an investment,” said Behrendt. “We do consult our engineers for due diligence and we also connect them with other startups. We&#8217;re trying to combine the best of both worlds. So we are acting like a financial VC, we&#8217;re taking board seats, we&#8217;re leading rounds, we can make quick decisions. And on the other hand we&#8217;re providing all the connections within our organization to the company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startups that BMW i Ventures invests in get the benefit of networking with BMW engineers and employees and learning from a legacy company how the automotive ecosystem works. Behrendt says for a company like Solid Power, where the technology is another four or five years out, there’s a strong collaboration between BMW’s business unit and the company to help them grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a win-win situation,” said Behrendt. “We are introducing them and will bring them into the company, they will be talking to the right engineers. There’s no guarantee that they will get a contract in, but they will start working together and exploring and getting help and maybe helping out with quick solutions.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, the maker of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">social networking app for women,</a> is entering into the investing space with today&#8217;s launch of a microfund called <a href="http://www.peanut-app.io/starther">StartHER</a>. As the name implies, the new fund will focus on investing in women, as well as other historically excluded founders &#8220;of all ages, life stages, ethnicities and sexual orientations,&#8221; the company says. In particular, StartHER aims to tackle the difficulties specific groups have in raising their first capital &#8212; something typically referred to as the &#8220;friends and family round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peanut argues there&#8217;s inherent bias in assuming that every startup founder has access to what are, essentially, wealthy friends or family who can spare a little startup capital. These rounds often range in size from $10,000 to as large as $150,000 or more, and can make a difference when it comes to getting a new company off the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;The assumption that founders should have networks able to invest in their businesses creates an unfair starting line for most groups. If we don’t remove barriers to that initial funding by providing access to capital, how can we ever hope to see a changing founder profile further through the fundraising funnel?” says Peanut CEO Michelle Kennedy, in a statement about the fund&#8217;s launch. &#8220;Peanut’s StartHER fund opens the door to founders looking for that early funding. It’s our opportunity to finally level the playing field. We want to be the family these founders can turn to, opening the door to our professional networks too.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lack of access to funds for female founders may have gotten worse during the pandemic. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">Crunchbase data indicates</a> female-founded startups globally saw a 27% decrease in funding in 2020 as compared to 2019. The pandemic shut down access to in-person networking opportunities and disproportionately impacted the family caretakers who tend to be women, as schools, daycares and other childcare assistance businesses closed their doors. These changes may have contributed to the decline, though it&#8217;s hard to pinpoint.</p>

<p>But even outside the pandemic&#8217;s impacts, women are underrepresented in venture investing &#8212; including on the firm&#8217;s side. Only <a href="https://allraise.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://allraise.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1625160023218000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3UHx7u2tFm6jJZD0pUopG97j0PQ">13% of decision-makers</a> at VC firms are women, which can influence what startups receive funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s no secret that the venture capital industry is dominated by those with privilege and lucrative connections. As a member of the Female Founders Fund, I’m excited to be a part of StartHER’s investment committee to help these entrepreneurs, who have not been adequately recognized, grow their networks in the venture capital community,” said Anu Duggal, Founding Partner of Female Founders Fund, who joined SheHER&#8217;s investment committee.</p>
<p>StartHER says it&#8217;s looking to step in to fill that gap by offering small investments to early-stage, pre-seed businesses focused on making a positive impact on society, healthcare, or the environment. According to its online application, StartHER will write checks of between $25,000 and $50,000 &#8212; likely one of the first checks a new startup may receive. The overall fund is $300,000 in size, and will make 3-4 investments in 2021. Peanut will not take an equity stake in the companies it invests in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving forward, we’ll be considering other factors such as deal flow to help inform how we invest and the companies we choose to invest in,&#8221; explains Kennedy. We’re heavily focused on making the right investments that will have the most impact versus simply making returns. For StartHER, our goal is not to make X number of investments for X returns, but to diversify the VC funnel by serving as an entry point to capital for underrepresented founders,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Along with Duggal and Kennedy, the investment committee for the fund includes journalist and angel investor Bérénice Magistretti; Chief Business Officer at Conde Nast Britain, Vanessa Kingori MBE; Founder of Shiffon Co. and Startup Girl Foundation, Shilpa Yarlagadda; and author, columnist and Brand Strategist, Elizabeth Uviebinene.</p>
<p>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, and the committee meets every six months to consider the fund&#8217;s applications. Beyond the investment, startups who receive SheHER funds will also be given access and office hours to the networks of the committee members, the <a href="http://www.peanut-app.io/starther">website</a> says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars wants to completely electrify its lineup by 2030 and on Wednesday offered a glimpse into how it plans to get there and what its next generation of vehicles might look like.</p>
<p>But it’s not going to do it alone. Although the automaker plans on developing its own in-car operating system and other parts of the car, Volvo Cars detailed how it plans to work with partners like Northvolt, Google and Luminar to build out its future vehicles lineup. It also unveiled the first images of “Concept Recharge,” a concept EV that has flat floors, two interior screens and rear &#8220;suicide doors&#8221; that open from the middle of the vehicle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172288" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172288" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172288" class="wp-caption-text">Volvo Concept Recharge. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volvo Cars</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Concept Recharge is also outfitted with Luminar sensors, in line with an announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/volvos-flagship-electric-suv-will-come-with-luminars-lidar-and-software-as-standard/">earlier this month</a> that Volvo Cars’ forthcoming flagship electric SUV will be equipped with Luminar’s technology stack as standard.</p>
<p>On the battery front, Volvo Cars is working with Swedish battery developer Northvolt on a pack that it says will enable a range of up to around 621 miles — a massive achievement of energy density, should Northvolt pull it off. The two companies are aiming to build a gigafactory in Europe by 2026 in a new 50-50 joint venture, with a potential annual capacity of up to 50 gigawatt hours. Volvo Cars will also source 15 GWh of batteries from Northvolt’s battery plant in Skellefteå, Sweden from 2024.</p>
<p>Future Volvo Cars vehicles will be capable of bidirectional charging, a capability that can turn the EV into a mobile generator or a mini power plant, offloading excess energy to the electricity grid.</p>
<p>Volvo said its OS, VolvoCars.OS, will act as an “umbrella system” for underlying operating systems, including its infotainment system led by Google and tech from Linux, QNX and AUTOSAR. While the vehicle will contain up to 100 electrical control units, these will run on a core computing system made up of three main computers being developed in partnership with Nvidia.</p>
<p>The automaker also discussed in more detail its plans to equip its flagship electric SUV with Luminar’s sensor suite and technology from Volvo’s software arm Zenseact. Executives shirked questions asking to specify the level of the autonomous system — referring to the scale developed by the Society of Automobile Engineers to measure the level of autonomy in a driving system — saying that they preferred to discuss the forthcoming AV driving system in terms of supervised or unsupervised. Under those terms, Volvo said the two modes — Cruise and Ride— would require driver supervision and no supervision, respectively. It said it would gradually launch unsupervised functionality at some point in the future.</p>
<p>The forthcoming system will generate tons of driving data from customers, and Volvo doesn’t intend on it to go to waste. The automaker said it aims to build a data factory to process information it collects from customers that use its autonomous drive safety features (with their consent). It would use this data to make improvements on the system, which it would push to vehicles via over-the-air updates.</p>
<p>“We need to transform this company from just a premium conventional company. We need to transform it into a leader in the new premium electric segment, which is growing very fast,” Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said. “We need to understand batteries in the same way we understand the combustion engine.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Everyone from investors to casual LinkedIn observers has more reasons than ever to look at buildings and wonder what’s going on inside. The property industry is known for moving slowly when it comes to adopting new technologies, but novel concepts and products are now entering this market at a dizzying pace.</p>
<p>However, this ever-growing array of smart-building products has made it confusing for professionals who seek to implement digital building platform (DBP) technologies in their spaces, let alone across their entire enterprise. The waters get even murkier when it comes to cloud platforms and their impact on ROI with regard to energy usage and day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Breaking down technology decisions into bite-sized pieces, starting with fundamental functions, is the most straightforward way to cut through the promotional haze.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Facility managers, energy professionals and building operators are increasingly hit with daily requests to review the latest platform for managing and operating their buildings. Here are a few tips to help decision-makers clear through the marketing fluff and put DBP platforms to the test.</p>
<h2>The why, how and what</h2>
<p>Breaking down technology decisions into bite-sized pieces, starting with fundamental functions, is the most straightforward way to cut through the promotional haze. Ask two simple questions: Who on your team will use this technology and what problem will it solve for them? Answers to these questions will help you maintain your key objectives, making it easier to narrow down the hundreds of options to a handful.</p>
<p>Another way to prioritize problems and solutions when sourcing smart-building technology is to identify your use cases. If you don&#8217;t know why you need a technology platform for your smart building, you&#8217;ll find it difficult to tell which option is better. Further, once you have chosen one, you&#8217;ll be hard put to determine if it has been successful. We find use cases draw the most direct line from why to how and what.</p>
<p>For example, let’s examine the why, how and what questions for a real estate developer planning to construct or modernize a commercial office building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why will people come? — Our building will be full of amenities and technological touches that will make discerning tenants feel comfortable, safe and part of a warm community of like-minded individuals.</li>
<li>How will we do it? — Implement the latest tenant-facing technology offering services and capabilities that are not readily available at home. We will create indoor and outdoor environments that make people feel comfortable and happy.</li>
<li>What tools, products and technology will we use?</li>
</ul>
<p>This last question is often the hardest to answer and is usually left until the last possible moment. For building systems integrators, this is where the real work begins.</p>
<h2>Focus on desired outcomes</h2>
<p>When various stakeholder groups begin their investigations of the technology, it is crucial to define the outcomes everyone hopes to achieve for each use case. When evaluating specific products, it helps to categorize them at high levels.</p>
<p>Several high-level outcomes, such as digital twin enablement, data normalization and data storage are expected across multiple categories of systems. However, only an enterprise building management system includes the most expected outcomes. Integration platform as a service, bespoke reports and dashboarding, analytics as a service and energy-optimization platforms have various enabled and optional outcomes.</p>
<p>The following table breaks down a list of high-level outcomes and aligns them to a category of smart-building platforms available in the market. Expanded definitions of each item are included at the end of this article.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hourone.ai/">Hour One</a>, a startup that allows businesses to create ‘photoreal’ presenters which can speak pre-set any text or any language in a highly realistic manner, has signed a deal with Berlitz. The language learning giant will use the platform to augment its instructor-led services and grow its online language training programs in a way that would normally be impossible, without hiring thousands of human teachers.</p>
<p>Curt Uehlein, Berlitz’s CEO said in a statement: &#8220;Berlitz has built our methodology and brand on delivering the best outcomes for students serious about fluency, which requires a very human-centric experience. Our digital experiences had to replicate the classroom experience. Doing that successfully means Berlitz can extend our reach into new markets, and be more accessible to students, removing barriers of location and affordability.”</p>
<p>Hour One has been able to almost re-create the in-person instructor experience for Berlitz, with highly-realistic photoreal characters who have (in my opinion) very natural facial expressions and gestures, and &#8211; crucially &#8211; perfectly synced speech. I’ve seen the software in operation myself and it is extremely convincing. Instead of course content being created in a studio with a human speaker, it can now be generated using AI. Look out language teachers…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oren Aharon, CEO, Hour One said: “Where other brands keep innovation at the periphery, Berlitz has fully embraced our technology to scale its business and propel it into the new era.”</p>
<p>Originally from Israel and new in New York, Hour One has raised $5 million from Galaxy Interactive, Kindred Ventures and Remagine Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s easy to forget, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce bought Slack</a> at the end of last year for almost $28 billion, a deal that has yet to close. We don&#8217;t know exactly when that will happen, but Slack continues to develop its product roadmap adding new functionality, even while waiting to become part of Salesforce eventually.</p>
<p>Just this morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">the company made official</a> some new tools it had been talking about for some time including a new voice tool called Slack Huddles, which is available starting today, along with video messaging and a directory service called Slack Atlas.</p>
<p>These tools enhance the functionality of the platform in ways that should prove useful as it becomes part of Salesforce whenever that happens. It&#8217;s not hard to envision how integrating Huddles or the video tools (or even Slack Atlas for both internal and external company organizational views) could work when integrated into the Salesforce platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield says the companies aren&#8217;t working together yet because of regulatory limits on communications, but he could definitely see how these tools could work in tandem with Salesforce Service Cloud and Sales Cloud among others and how you can start to merge the data in Salesforce with Slack&#8217;s communications capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;[There&#8217;s] this excitement around workflows from the big system of record [in Salesforce] into the communication [in Slack] and having the data show up where the conversations are happening. And I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential here for leveraging these indirectly in customer interactions, whether that&#8217;s sales, marketing, support or whatever,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said that he could also see Salesforce taking advantage of Slack Connect, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">a capability introduced last year</a> that enables companies to communicate with people outside the company. &#8220;We have all this stuff working inside of Slack Connect, and you get all the same benefits that you would get using Huddles to properly start a conversation, solve some problem or use video as a better way of communicating with [customers],&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Sapphire&#8217;s Jai Das thinks the Salesforce-Slack deal could succeed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/why-sapphires-jai-das-thinks-the-salesforce-slack-deal-could-succeed/embed/#?secret=VWyyVdfsaw" data-secret="VWyyVdfsaw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These announcements seem to fall into two main categories: the future of work and in the context of the acquisition. Bret Taylor, Salesforce president and COO certainly seemed to recognize that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/why-slack-and-salesforce-execs-think-theyre-better-together/">when discussing the deal with TechCrunch</a> when it was announced back in December. He sees the two companies directly addressing the changing face of work:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we say we really want Slack to be this next generation interface for Customer 360, what we mean is we’re pulling together all these systems. How do you rally your teams around these systems in this digital work-anywhere world that we’re in right now where these teams are distributed and collaboration is more important than ever,” Taylor said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that there is clearly a future of work angle at play as the two companies come together. &#8220;I think moves like [today&#8217;s Slack announcements] are in response to where things are trending with respect to the future of work as we all find ourselves spending an increasing amount of time in front of webcams and microphones in our home offices meeting and collaborating with others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Huddles is an example of how the company is trying to fix that screen fatigue from too many meetings or typing our thoughts. &#8220;This kind of &#8220;audio-first&#8221; capability takes the emphasis off trying to type what we mean in the way we think will get the point across to just being able to say it without the additional effort to make it look right,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Leary added, &#8220;And not only will it allow people to just speak, but also allows us to get a better understanding of the sentiment and emotion that also comes with speaking to people and not having to guess what the intent/emotion is behind the text in a chat.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Karissa Bell pointed out on Engadget, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-audio-143014019.html">Huddles also works like Discord&#8217;s chat feature</a> in a business context, which could have great utility for Salesforce tools when it&#8217;s integrated with the Salesforce platform</p>
<p>While the regulatory machinations grind on, Slack continues to develop its platform and products. It will of course continue to operate as a stand-alone company, even when the mega deal finally closes, but there will certainly be plenty of cross-platform integrations.</p>
<p>Even if executives can&#8217;t discuss what those integrations could look like openly, there has to be a lot of excitement at Salesforce and Slack about the possibilities that these new tools bring to the table &#8212; and to the future of work in general &#8212; whenever the deal crosses the finish line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is your opportunity to get a glimpse of the future of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS. Apple just released the first public beta of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">iOS 15</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-announced-at-wwdc-features-improved-multitasking-and-improved-swift-playgrounds-support/">iPadOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/watchos-8-brings-new-mindfulness-features-and-respiratory-tracking/">watchOS 8</a>. Those releases are the next major versions of the operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Unlike developer betas, everyone can download these betas — you don’t need a $99 developer account. But don’t forget, it’s a beta.</p>
<p>The company still plans to release the final version of iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and watchOS 8 this fall. But Apple is going to release betas every few weeks over the summer. It’s a good way to fix as many bugs as possible and gather data from a large group of users.</p>
<p>As always, Apple’s public betas closely follow the release cycle of developer betas. Apple also released the second developer beta of iOS and iPadOS 15 today. So it sounds like the first public beta is more or less the same build as the second developer build.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But remember, you shouldn’t install a beta on your primary iPhone or iPad. The issue is not just bugs — some apps and features won’t work at all. In some rare cases, beta software can also brick your device and make it unusable. You may even lose data on iCloud. Proceed with extreme caution.</p>
<p>But if you have an iPad, iPhone or Apple Watch you don’t need, here’s how to download it. Head over to Apple’s <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">beta website</a> from the device you want to use for the beta and download the configuration profile — do that from your iPhone for the watchOS beta. It’s a tiny file that tells your device to update to public betas like it’s a normal software update.</p>
<p>Once it’s installed, reboot your device, then head over to the Settings (or Watch) app. You should see an update. In September, your device should automatically update to the final version of iOS 15, iPadOS 15 or watchOS 8 and you’ll be able to delete the configuration profile.</p>
<p>The biggest change of iOS 15 is a new Focus mode. In addition to &#8220;Do not disturb,&#8221; you can configure various modes — you can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you’re doing. For instance, you can create a Work mode, a Sleep mode, a Workout mode, etc.</p>
<p>There are many new features across the board, such as a new Weather app, updated maps in Apple Maps, an improved version of FaceTime with SharePlay and more. Safari also has a brand new look.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a> has made a name for itself among parents as a useful resource for vetting entertainment and technology in terms of its age-appropriateness. Now, the organization&#8217;s for-profit affiliate, <a href="http://www.commonsensenetworks.com/">Common Sense Networks</a>, is taking inspiration from those kid-friendly recommendations with the launch of new streaming service called <a href="https://www.sensicaltv.com/">Sensical</a>. The service offers age-appropriate, entertaining, and educational videos for children ages 2 through 10.</p>
<p>At launch, the free, ad-supported service includes over 15,000 hand-curated videos and over 50 topic-based channels for children to explore. And unlike other platforms, like Netflix or YouTube, Sensical doesn&#8217;t use algorithms to make content recommendations. Instead, kids are encouraged to follow their own interests and passions across over 50 topic-based channels. This includes things like Adventures, Animals, Arts &amp; Crafts, Music, Science, Sports, Video Games, and other sorts of kid-friendly topics.</p>
<p>Kids can star these channels, or individual videos or series, in order to keep up with their favorite content in a dedicated Favorites section within the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kids will see a selection of these channels based on their age, but the company is working to expand the channel lineup so there will be even more specific categories in the future. For example, instead of just &#8220;sports,&#8221; there could be channels like &#8220;soccer&#8221; or &#8220;gymnastics.&#8221; Instead of &#8220;Arts,&#8221; there could be &#8220;drawing&#8221; or &#8220;origami.&#8221; Instead of just &#8220;science,&#8221; it could include channels like &#8220;geography&#8221; or &#8220;robotics,&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172223" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172223" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg 2666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=1536,1123 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=2048,1498 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Common Sense Networks</p></div></p>
<p>The app also features a Live TV section, which is programmed throughout the day with kid-friendly content so kids don&#8217;t have to browse to find something to quickly watch.</p>
<p>While other streaming services on the market offer kid-friendly content &#8212; as that&#8217;s a huge selling point for subscribers &#8212; it&#8217;s not always organized in a way that makes sense. Sometimes, all the content gets lumped into a general &#8220;Kids&#8221; category where videos for little kids are mixed in with content for older children. Sensical, meanwhile, curates the content recommendations into three different experiences, including preschool (2-4), little kids (5-7), and big kids (8-10).</p>
<p>What the child sees is based on how parents configure their profile. Plus, parents can use the service&#8217;s ParentZone in-app dashboard to set screen time limits, extend limits as needed, and view daily reports on what the child has watched.</p>
<p>The service&#8217;s best feature, however, is that the content is assured to be age-appropriate &#8212; even the ads.</p>
<p>This is possible because the curation approach Sensical takes, which is very different from YouTube Kids. YouTube&#8217;s app for kids leans on algorithms to filter out adult content from YouTube&#8217;s broader library, but the company doesn&#8217;t manually review all the videos it includes. It warns parents that some inappropriate content could slip through. (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/youtube-kids-inappropriate-horrified-mom-discovers-suicide-instructions-in-video-on-youtube-and-youtube-kids/">And</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22412232/youtube-kids-autoplay">it</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html">has</a>). Common Sense Networks, meanwhile, says dozens of trained child development experts view, vet, and rate &#8220;every single frame of video&#8221; that goes live on its service using its proprietary IP and patent<b> </b>pending process. This system involves tagging content with specific child developmental benefits, too.</p>
<p>Sensical also vets its advertising, which is how the service is supported, with similar direct oversight. Its experts review the sponsor&#8217;s content to ensure it&#8217;s appropriate for children &#8212; an area that&#8217;s often overlooked on other services.</p>

<p>To fill its library, Common Sense Networks partnered with dozens of studios and distribution partners as well as digital-first creators.</p>
<p>Studio and distribution partners include CAKE (<i>Poppy Cat</i>), Cyber Group Studios (<i>Leo The Wildlife Ranger</i>), The Jim Henson Company (<i>The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, Jim Henson&#8217;s Animal Show with Stinky and Jake</i>), Mattel (<i>Kipper, Pingu, Max Steel</i>), Raydar Media (<i>Five Apples’ limited series, Apple Tree House),</i> Superights (<i>Bo Bear, Handico</i>), WildBrain (<i>Teletubbies, Rev &amp; Roll</i>), Xilam Animation (<i>Learn and Play with Paprika, Moka&#8217;s Fabulous Adventures</i>), ZDF Enterprises (<i>Lexi &amp; Lottie, School of Roars</i>), Zodiak Kids (<i>Mister Maker, Tee and Mo</i>), ABC Commercial, CBC &amp; Radio-Canada Distribution, Jetpack Distribution, Nelvana, 9 Story Distribution International, Sesame Workshop, Serious Lunch, and Studio 100.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2172226" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172226" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2172226" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172226" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Common Sense Networks</p></div></p>
<p>Having briefly toyed around with the mobile app, it appears Sensical works as described. If I had any complaints personally, it would only be that the experience could be dismissed as &#8220;baby stuff&#8221; by older kids approaching their tween years, due to the cute pictures and youthful iconography used in the app&#8217;s design. Kids in older age groups take issue with being treated as if they&#8217;re younger &#8212; and they take particular notice of anything that does so. The same complaint goes for the Live TV programming, which was clearly aimed at littler kids when we checked it out, despite testing the app as child profile whose age was set to &#8220;10.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also think it would be nice if there was a better way to track Favorite channels and see when they&#8217;re updated with new videos, as kids moving to Sensical from YouTube will want to &#8220;feel&#8221; like they&#8217;re still connected to new and fresh content, not a library. But Sensical isn&#8217;t YouTube. There&#8217;s a trade-off between hand-curation and timeliness, and Sensical is favoring the former.</p>
<p>Sensical had been first introduced this spring during a closed beta, but is now publicly available to stream across web and mobile on iOS<b>, </b>Android<b>,</b><b> </b>Roku<b>, </b>Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV. This summer, it will expand to more distribution platforms, including VIZIO.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve spent millions of dollars running ads for brands like Outschool, Imperfect Produce and Microsoft. At <a href="http://demandcurve.com">Demand Curve</a>, we’ve worked with over 500 startups, meticulously documenting growth tactics for all growth channels. This post also incorporates what we&#8217;ve learned from our agency, <a href="http://bellcurve.com">Bell Curve</a>.</p>
<p>Here are seven ad types that have proven to increase click-through rates (CTR), with examples of each. Clone them to test in your own social ad campaigns.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Address common complaints and questions directly in your ads, as they will help eliminate objections upfront and encourage clicking to learn more.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Customer reactions</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling a consumer product, it’s likely that some of your customers have posted product reviews, unboxings or recommendation videos on their social media accounts. You can use your customers&#8217; user-generated videos in your social ads — with permission.</p>
<p>Search through Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for posts that mention your product. Reach out to the customer and ask them if you can use their content in an ad campaign, and subsequently, compile the most positive reactions into a video ad.</p>
<p>This works well because dramatic faces are attention magnets. Make sure the thumbnail photo shows a strong emotional image. People will click because they can&#8217;t help but want to see what provoked the emotion. User-generated reaction videos also highlight your products&#8217; &#8220;Moment of Wow.&#8221; If users care enough about your product to make a positive reaction video, their energy is contagious. Your ad audience will connect your product with a strong positive emotion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172059" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172059" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2172059 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg" alt="Customer reactions make for great ads" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/reaction.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172059" class="wp-caption-text">Customer reactions make for great ads. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>You versus the competition</h2>
<p>Comparison ads anchor your product against something your audience already knows. This works well for both ads and the landing page your ad will lead to when clicked on. Try positioning your strongest value proposition — the most valuable promise you&#8217;re making to your customer — against your generic competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the white-hot creator economy space, startups are increasingly looking to build paint-by-numbers platforms to help budding creators more easily execute on what were once seemingly insurmountable business challenges.</p>
<p>The ex-Uber team at <a href="https://www.pietrastudio.com/">Pietra</a> is cashing in on this vision with a plan to build a backend for launching and scaling creator product lines.</p>
<p>The startup, which previously acted as a marketplace for jewelry sellers, has changed a bit since they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/24/startups-weekly-diamond-encrusted-disruption/">announced a seed round from Andreessen Horowitz in early 2019</a>. Now, the company has pivoted from hocking diamonds to building a broad platform for creators that are looking to scale sales of physical goods, from interfacing with suppliers, handling orders and fulfillment and setting up online storefronts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pietra tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve just raised a $15 million Series A led by Founders Fund with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz, TQ Ventures and Abstract Ventures. The deal was led by Founders Fund&#8217;s Keith Rabois.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were initially focused on jewelry and luxury and the rise of creators in this luxury segment,&#8221; CEO Ronak Trivedi tells TechCrunch. &#8220;When we launched our beta last fall we had this platform that had evolved from a marketplace to a creator hub where any size creator could come in, use the platform, marketplace and tools to effectively launch a digital-first consumer business in the most efficient, cost-effective way possible.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wZBEKlDWQ7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=wZBEKlDWQ7" data-secret="wZBEKlDWQ7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pietra allows customers to shop around with a network of suppliers, find which one is best for them and move through the process from crafting samples through order fulfillment with a tech platform to guide them through the process. Trivedi says the ultimate goal is to &#8220;find the best suppliers in the world and try and bring them on the platform at the lowest minimum orders, so that it allows the most people to try to start a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is trying to help small creators scale their product distribution, but also handle all of the bits that can determine success when it comes to launching a brand in the first place, including building a pre-sale website and building up some attractive marketing images of products.</p>
<p>Early on, Pietra has a pretty distinct list of product verticals that they&#8217;re specializing in, including swimwear, makeup, apparel, fragrances and jewelry, among a few others. Overall, their platform seems pretty centered on the types of products that have been broadly successful with influencers who are looking to build out their first brands.</p>
<p>Pietra&#8217;s<a href="https://www.pietrastudio.com/pricing"> pricing</a> depends on how many of their services you&#8217;re using and what the scale of your operation is, but most services are charged on a per-unit basis, with the startup also taking a percentage fee on goods sold through their marketplace. The startup is also working on a Pro offering with differentiated pricing designed for slightly more established brands that are doing multiple production runs per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has petitioned that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">newly minted Chair of the FTC</a> and implacable critic of the company, Lina Khan, be recused from decisions relating to the company. The company argues that she has been too outspoken about the failure to regulate Amazon to handle matters impartially.</p>
<p>It will be for the FTC to decide, and its oversight committee to supervise, whether Khan will recuse herself; an agency spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s argument (which you can read below) is that Khan has simply gone too far in her criticism of Amazon prior to her confirmation at the FTC, creating an effective &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; that precludes her ability to consider cases relating to the company objectively.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Amazon profoundly disagrees with Chair Khan’s conclusions about the company, it does not dispute her right to have spoken provocatively and at great length about it in her prior roles. But given her long track record of detailed pronouncements about Amazon, and her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws, a reasonable observer would conclude that she no longer can consider the company’s antitrust defenses with an open mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it&#8217;s equally plain to &#8220;a reasonable observer&#8221; that Amazon, one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, is a natural target for analysis by an expert whose professional opinion is that antitrust regulation is inadequate and dated.</p>
<p>And it was arguably this very idea that set her on the path to her nomination and sudden ascendance to Chair. Her &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221; paper was not the manifestation of a vendetta against the online services giant — it was an indictment of the aging antitrust doctrine that permitted what she argued amounted to legalized monopolistic behavior.</p>
<p>Amazon may have been the one in the crosshairs, but it was only a stand-in for an entire school of regulatory thought that, Khan has persuasively argued in numerous papers and articles, mindlessly pursued a narrow definition of consumer harms and benefits. There are other ways that a company might act against consumer interests, such as crushing competition in a market by subsidizing costs through dominance of another market — something Amazon has made core to its entire business model.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HIJVKN1a1s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/amazon-antitrust-suit-dc-attorney-general/">DC attorney general files antitrust suit against Amazon over third-party seller agreements</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DC attorney general files antitrust suit against Amazon over third-party seller agreements&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/amazon-antitrust-suit-dc-attorney-general/embed/#?secret=HIJVKN1a1s" data-secret="HIJVKN1a1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Furthermore, the position of Chair at the FTC is one of leadership and priority setting, not utter impartiality. The impartiality comes in the form of legal arguments that show a company has, for example, broken the law. Long-held opinions count for nothing with a judge, including Khan&#8217;s own public and professionally expressed opinions; should she lead the agency in an effort against Amazon, she will have to support her interpretation of the law with facts and systematic argument.</p>
<p>While one can only speculate at the administration&#8217;s true reasoning for its rapid elevation of Khan, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that it&#8217;s anything but a whole-hearted endorsement of the philosophy and change she advocates.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s expertise and perspective on antitrust have made Amazon a natural antagonist, not because Khan is a monomaniacal crusader, but because Amazon could very well represent one of the largest regulatory failures in history. To point that out is not grounds for recusal — it may however be grounds for making history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://swordhealth.com/">SWORD Health</a>, a virtual musculoskeletal care platform founded in 2015, announced today that it has raised an $85 million Series C funding round led by General Catalyst. Other participating investors included BOND, Highmark Ventures, BPEA, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Transformation Capital and Green Innovations. The funding comes months after the company raised a $25 million Series B round &#8211; which, put differently, means that the New York-based company has now raised $110 million across six months.</p>
<p>CEO and founder of SWORD Health,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vbento"> Virgílio Bento</a>, said that company was not actively having conversations with external VCs when it raised the round. The Series C closed within three weeks of the first anchor investor’s check.</p>
<p>“Given the interest of the market, given the valuations, and given the ability to bring other stellar investors [who] can help us grow even faster and more efficiently &#8211; that’s why we decided to raise again,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SWORD Health’s massive tranche of capital comes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">the world of MSK digital health startups continues to boom</a>, thanks to the broad rise of virtual care. Venture-backed startups such as Kaia Health, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd/">saw its business grow by 600% in 2020</a> and Hinge Health, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">which was last valued at $3 billion</a>, are hitting growth stage. SWORD Health, while founded in 2015, has only been in the market for 18 months. Bento declined to share the company’s exact valuation, but he confirmed that it was north of $500 million.</p>
<p>MSK conditions, which can range from a sprained ankle to a disc compression, are diverse and, unfortunately, universally felt. The sheer expansiveness of the condition has triggered a crop of entrepreneurs to create solutions that help people avoid surgery or addictive opioids, two of the mainstream ways to deal with MSK conditions.</p>
<p>SWORD Health&#8217;s solution looks like this: The platform connects consumers to a virtual physical therapist who is accessible via traditional telemedicine. Beyond that, the company gives each consumer a tablet and motion sensors. The consumers are promoted to go through the motions, and get feedback and tips through a SWORD HealthDigital Therapist.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nikillinit">Nikhil Krishnan</a>, the founder of Out-of-Pocket, explained how it all works <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/p/sword-health-and-virtual-musculoskeletal">through a first-person account:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>As you go through them, the sensors + digital therapist can tell if the movements are correct and how far you’re moving in each direction. The digital therapist has 5000 different types of feedback messages like “don’t bend your knee,” “lean forward more,” and “your squat form is more embarrassing than your Facebook etiquette circa 2009.” You get a score of 1-5 stars depending on how far you move in a direction for a given exercise. My regimen was usually between 17-25 exercises and in total would take me 20-25 minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>SWORD Health sells to insurers, health systems and employers in the United States, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>SWORD Health’s biggest competitor is Hinge Health, last valued at $3 billion. However, for now, Bento isn&#8217;t too worried about the behemoth.</p>
<p>“It’s really two different studies on how to build a healthcare company,” Bento said. He pointed to how SWORD Health spent its first four years as a company developing its sensor, while he claims that Hinge went out to the market with “a half-baked solution&#8221; in sensor technology.</p>
<p>That said, in March 2021, Hinge acquired medical device maker Enso to grow its<a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/hinge-health-adds-breakthrough-pain-mgt-tech-to-digital-msk-clinic/"> non-invasive, musculoskeletal therapy tech</a>, and continues to have the biggest marketshare among private startups in the sector.</p>
<p>The company touted that it has increased its number of treated patients 1,000% year over year, which has led to 600% year-over-year revenue growth. Given the fact that it&#8217;s only been in the market for 18 months, these metrics don’t provide an entirely holistic picture into the business, but instead offer a snapshot into the recent growth of an early-stage tool. With millions more, the SWORD Health founder is set to invest more in the company, and continue to not focus too much on profitability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big problem that we want to solve, so we really want to reinvest all of the gross profit that we are generating into building a platform that is able to deliver more value to patients,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit had a successful first commercial launch, meaning there&#8217;s now officially another small satellite launch provider in operation with a track record of delivering payloads to space. Virgin Orbit&#8217;s LauncherOne rocket took off from its carrier aircraft at around 11:45 AM EDT today, and the spacecraft had a successful series of engine fires and stage separations to make the trip to low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>On board, Virgin Orbit carried seven payloads, including the first-ever defense satellite for the Netherlands, as well as cubsats developed by the U.S. Department of Defense for its Rapid Agile Launch initiative. The initiative is seeking to test the viability of flying small spacecraft to space on relatively short notice on launch platforms with increased flexibility, which Virgin Orbit&#8217;s provides thanks to its ability to take off horizontally from more or less conventional runways.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit also carried two Earth observation satellites for Polish startup SatRevolution, and it will be delivering more in future flights to help build out that company&#8217;s planned 14-spacecraft constellation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January, Virgin Orbit completed its final demonstration mission, reaching orbit for the first time with LauncherOne. That paved the way for this mission, and the company plans to increase the pace and frequency of its commercial missions, with at least one more planned tentatively for later this year and many more in 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of payload capacity, Virgin Orbit&#8217;s Launcher One can carry around 1,100 pounds to low Earth orbit, which compares favorably with the capacity of Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron, which can carry around 661 pounds to the same destination.</p>
<p>It fits a niche for small satellite operators that currently have a lot of demand, served in part by SpaceX, as well with its ridesharing missions, but Virgin Orbit has the potential to provide more dedicated services for operator looking to launch just a few small spacecraft for a modest constellation. And as mentioned, its potential for varying its take-off location in future could be a big competitive advantage in the defense and security industries.</p>

The new charges, which include six counts of computer fraud and abuse and one count of access device [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed seven new charges against Paige Thompson, the former Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a>) engineer accused of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/">hacking Capital One</a> and stealing the personal data of more than 100 million Americans.</p>
<p>The new charges, which include six counts of computer fraud and abuse and one count of access device fraud, were revealed in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974985-capitalone-hack-june-2021-superseeding-indictment">court documents</a> filed earlier this month, obtained by <a href="https://therecord.media/new-charges-filed-against-capital-one-hacker-trial-postponed-to-2022/">The Record</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The previous indictment charged Thompson with one count each of wire fraud and computer crime and abuse, which meant she faced five up to five in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. As a result of the additional charges, Thompson now faces up to 20 years of jail time.</p>
<p>The superseding indictment has also expanded the number of victimized companies from the four listed in the 2019 indictment to eight. In addition to Capital One, a U.S. state agency, a U.S. public research university and an international telecommunications conglomerate, the list now includes a data and threat protection company, an organization that specializes in digital rights management (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/drm/">DRM</a>), a provider of higher education learning technology, and a supplier of call center solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The companies have not been named, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/capital-one-breach-vodafone-ford-researchers/">security firm CyberInt previously said </a>that Vodafone, Ford, Michigan State University and the Ohio Department of Transportation may all be victims of the breach.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thompson, who used the handle “erratic” online and was identified after boasting about her activities on GitHub, remains accused of using her knowledge from her previous employment as a software engineer at Amazon to create a program that identified which customers of a cloud computing company (the indictment doesn&#8217;t name the company, but it has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/capital-one-data-systems-breached-by-seattle-woman-u-s-says">identified as Amazon Web Services</a>) had misconfigured firewalls. Once the tool found its target misconfiguration, Thompson allegedly exploited it to extract privileged account credentials.</p>
<p>The prior indictment alleges that once Thompson gained access to victims&#8217; cloud infrastructure using the stolen credentials, she then accessed and downloaded data to a server at her residence in Seattle. It remains unclear whether any of the information was passed to third parties.</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capital-one/">Capital One</a> breach, which the company confirmed in July 2019, the stolen data comprised 106 million credit card applications, which included names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth, along with 140,000 Social Security numbers, 80,000 bank account numbers, and some credit scores and transaction data. Capital One, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/capital-one-security-chief-shuffle/">which replaced its cybersecurity chief four months after the incident</a>, was <a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2020-036.pdf">fined $80 million</a> in August 2020 for the security breach and its failure to keep its users’ financial data secure.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also allege that Thompson copied and stole data from at least 30 entities in total that used the same cloud provider, and claim that, in some cases, she used this access to set up cryptocurrency mining operations using victims&#8217; cloud computing power &#8211; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/ico-snafu/">practice known as cryptojacking</a>.</p>
<p>Thompson pleaded not guilty and was released on pre-trial bond in August 2019. She was initially set to face trial in November 2019, but the trial was delayed to March 2020 due to the huge amount of information the prosecution had to analyze.</p>
<p>The trial was later rescheduled to October 2020 due to the pandemic, then to June 2021, then October 2021, and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974986-motion-to-pospone-capitalone-hack-trial-to-2022">now to March 14, 2022</a>, with prosecutors still citing the need for more time to analyze the data collected from Thompson’s devices.</p>

The company has developed a small launch vehicle it calls Eris, a 25-meter (82 foot) rocket that can deliver a payload of up to 215 kilograms (474 pounds) to sun synchronous orbit.

<p>Eris is much smaller than other launch companies’ rockets. Relativity Space’s Terran One has a max payload capacity to LEO of around 1,250 kg (2,756 lbs); even SpaceX’s Falcon 1, its first and smallest orbital rocket, could deliver 450 kg (990 pounds). Gilmour Space is wagering that the lighter payload will result in lower costs for a burgeoning suite of customers looking to send spacecraft to orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funds will also go toward nearly doubling the company’s workforce, from 70 to 120 employees, and developing a new commercial spaceport at Abbot Point, Queensland. Australian legislators approved construction of the launch site in May. Gilmour Space is also examining a proposed launch site in South Australia to facilitate polar orbit launches.</p>
<p>Gilmour Space has already signed agreements with prospective customers for future Eris launches. This includes contracts with two Australian space startups: Space Machines Company, to launch a 35 kg spacecraft on Eris’s inaugural flight, and Fleet Space Technologies, to carry six nanosatellites in 2023. Gilmour Space has also signed an agreement with U.S.-based Momentus to use its orbital transfer services.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fine Structure Ventures and included contributions from Australian VCs Blackbird and Main Sequence, and Australian pension funds HESTA, Hostplus and NGS Super. Blackbird and Main Sequence are returning investors after leading Gilmour’s Series A and Series B, respectively. This is the largest amount of private equity funding ever raised by a space company in Australia, and brings the company’s total amount raised to $87 million AUD ($66 million USD).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s almost go-time for all you early-stage startup founders. That’s right, on July 8-9 thousands of determined entrepreneurs around the world will gather virtually for the best little two-day bootcamp we like to call <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>.</p>
<p>Two days focused on the bottom-line essentials to build your start up the right way. Here we lay out five reasons why you should stop what you’re doing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">buy your pass</a> and invest in a conference designed to make your work life a whole lot easier.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1. Learn from leading startup experts</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We packed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the agenda</a> with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">incredible subject-matter experts</a> who will offer highly interactive presentations across a range of topics every startup founder needs to know. Listen, engage and learn so you can avoid painful, expensive missteps and move forward without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>“Vlad Magdalin, founder of Webflow, was very candid about the challenges he faced on his journey to success. You always hear about startups that raise millions of dollars, but you don&#8217;t necessarily hear about the ups and downs it takes to get to that point. It’s important for early founders to see that side, too.” — Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl and Early Stage 2020 attendee.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2. Implement advice right out of the gate</strong></p>
<p>Plenty of conferences are long on opinion but short on advice that you can adapt and fold into your business now — when you need it the most. You won’t find that happening at TC Early Stage. Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft, told us she came away for Early Stage 2020 with tips she could implement right away.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">3. Expand your network</strong></p>
<p>Big networks offer more opportunities. It’s just that simple. You’ll have plenty of time to expand your networking empire at Early Stage. And, as Ashley Barrington notes, you never know where a chance meeting might lead one day.</p>
<blockquote><p>“CrunchMatch made it easy to set up short networking sessions with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. I met other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4. Improve your pitch deck</strong></p>
<p>Day two features a pitch-off between 10 early-stage founders. They’ll present their pitches and receive invaluable feedback from our panel of esteemed judges. Even if you’re not on that virtual stage pitching your heart out, you’ll learn a lot by tuning in. Take it from Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly, who attended Early Stage 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pitch deck teardown session was great. VCs reviewed my deck and gave specific, actionable advice. Watching them provide comments on other decks was helpful, too. We’re incorporating the feedback and when we start fundraising, the improved slides will make it easier for VCs to understand our value proposition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">5. Connect with your community</strong></p>
<p>Every TechCrunch event, whether it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage</a>, Disrupt or TC Sessions, strives to provide a sense of community. Why? Because you may go faster alone, but you’ll go further together. Commune, commiserate and celebrate with your tribe of early-stage founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>“TechCrunch does this thing of connecting total strangers to create a genuinely supportive community. We’re all trying to do the same thing, which is bring our idea to life and make it a reality. I loved that unexpected benefit.” — Jessica McLean, director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, there has been a surge of newly formed digital banks aimed at specific demographics. The banks in nearly all cases are trying to meet the needs of certain populations that they believe are feeling left out or underserved by traditional financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest such neobank to emerge is New York-based </span><a href="https://joindaylight.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as the first LGBTQ+ digital banking platform in the United States. (There is a digital bank in Brazil with a similar mission called </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/brazils-pride-bank-says-its-the-first-lgbti-bank-in-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pride Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBTQ+ entrepreneurs Rob Curtis (CEO), Billie Simmons, a trans woman (COO) and Paul Barnes Hoggett (CTO), Daylight is announcing today that it has secured $5 million in a seed funding round. Kapor Capital and Precursor Capital co-led the round, which included participation from Anthemis Group, Clocktower, Financial Venture Studio and Citi.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight says its mission is to “build a more equitable financial life for LGBTQ+ folks and their chosen families.” The company’s services are targeted toward LGBTQ+ people, their families, and allies — or as Daylight describes it, “values-based consumers who want to support the queer community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which was founded in 2020, plans to use its new capital mostly to expand its flagship product and lifestyle services, which are designed to improve financial equality and inclusion for the estimated 30-million-plus Americans who identify as LGBTQ+. It also plans to build out a LGBTQ+ business marketplace and a platform that offers discounts and rewards when members shop at merchants whose actions support the queer community.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=qQ8jkhK9nx" data-secret="qQ8jkhK9nx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch Curtis explained why he believes Daylight is uniquely positioned to help the population deal with challenges such as higher debt accumulation to factors such as p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-existing conditions, lower insurance levels, HIV management needs and [gender] transition costs. At the same time, many members of the community also have lower income levels due to “continued workplace discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBT people engage with money really differently and there’s a multitude of reasons for that,” Curtis said. “We spend about the same proportion of our income on discretionary spend, but we&#8217;re about 20% less likely to have a savings account, 20% less likely to own investments like stocks, or a quarter less likely to own a mutual fund. And we estimate that only about 30% of our community has any estate planning in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, life in general tends to be more costly for LGBTQ+ persons, Curtis believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is expensive to be a queer person,” he said. “Not only do we find that when we come out to our parents, 40% of us no longer have financial support for things like college and those transitions from childhood into adulthood. We end up with 50% more college debt. We also have increased sexual health costs and some have gender affirming surgery that they need to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the time we get to our 30s, we will be told ‘you can have one of the following three things: gender affirming surgery, a home deposit or a child,’ ” Curtis added. And, on top of that, having a child is generally more expensive for this population because people either have to adopt or hire a surrogate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapor Capital Partner Brian Dixon believes that the fact that Daylight’s founders have personally experienced problems within the traditional banking industry gives them the necessary insight to help others in the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those problems include friction associated with names on issued cards, which leads to customers being outed as trans. The population also faces a lack of adequate financing products, Dixon believes, for things such as surrogacy, IVF, adoption, transition support and mental health.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">Maybe neobanks will break even after all</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=Mweqgd4nkI" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many neobanks do not provide a truly unique banking experience that will result in a mass exodus from traditional banks,” Dixon said. “Daylight has an opportunity to be the outlier, especially given their focus on community. Daylight’s unique features include a seamless card issuance process that allows trans and non-binary customers to order a card in their preferred name, book sessions with expert LGBTQ+ financial coaches, get peer-to-peer advice from their digital community and earn rewards that are meaningful to the LGBT+ community.”</span></p>
<p>Daylight will offer features such as a checking account, the ability for members to get paid two days early, free ATMs and &#8220;no hidden fees,&#8221; according to Curtis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that payday early is really important because we know that there are high rates of credit card declines for folks who are buying hormones,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature the Daylight platform offers is personalized recommendations to members which alert them when they’re spending money with merchants that support anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and initiatives, a practice known as “rainbow washing.” It will also offer alternative merchants that it says are “more aligned with the community’s values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBTQ+ consumers, and those that support them, are very intentional about where they spend, but it’s difficult for an individual to know whether they’re spending in line with their values, or inadvertently shopping with brands that engages in rainbow washing while funding politicians and projects that work against our interests,” Curtis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight is currently in beta but already has “thousands and thousands” of customers on its wait list, said Curtis, who estimates that it will have 10,000 customers by the time it launches in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other digital banks targeting specific demographics that have raised funding over the past year include Fair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multilingual digital bank and financial services platform that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/fair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently launched to the public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after raising $20 million in 40 days earlier this year. Others that have emerged include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mandolin just marked its first birthday earlier this month, and yet the Indianapolis-based startup is already announcing a $12 million Series A. That’s a quick follow up to the $5 million seed it raised in early October of last year. Turns out the global pandemic is a pretty fortuitious time to launch and grow a concert streaming platform.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed round was co-led by 645 Ventures and Foundry Group and featured additional funding from existing investors like High Alpha and TIME Ventures (Marc Benioff).</p>
<p>The big question, of course, is what happens to a company like Mandolin when the world starts opening back up? Sure concert livestreams got a massive boost as fans and artists alike were seeking an outlet as touring ground to a halt. But what now that venues are starting to reopen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As artists return to performing in sold out venues, Live+ will undoubtedly become a can’t-live-without digital complement that amplifies live shows,” CEO Mary Kay Huse said in a release. “Our new round of financing will support us in driving innovation of our core solution, delivering new digital offerings, and reinforcing our routes to market, so that every show is Live+.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mandolin</p></div></p>
<p>Granted, that’s…pretty abstract. But the simple answer is the company has been looking toward enhancing the in-person event as well, ahead of an inevitable reopening. Essentially the company wants to build a companion app for shows.</p>
<p>Here’s what Huse told Variety last week, “I would love it if we could see upwards of 50% of in-person attendees experiencing something digitally while in the venue, as early as before the end of the year. It’s just creating a compelling content that makes them want to do it.”</p>
<p>The company will also continue to focus on streaming, which may see a hit, but certainly isn’t going away, post-pandemic. The news also sees 645 Managing Partner Nnamdi Okike joining the company’s board.</p>
<p>“During COVID-19, livestreaming has been a game-changer for fans who want to experience their favorite artists, and for artists and venues who want to bring exciting live events for their fans,” Okike said. “Mandolin provides the best technology platform to enable these experiences, and they’re also scaling a company to meet the needs of this fast-growing category.”</p>
