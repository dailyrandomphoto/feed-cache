										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a month ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/">researchers revealed</a> a notorious malware family was exploiting a never-before-seen vulnerability that let it bypass macOS security defenses and run unimpeded. Now, some of the same researchers say another malware can sneak onto macOS systems, thanks to another vulnerability.</p>
<p>Jamf says it found evidence that the XCSSET malware was exploiting a vulnerability that allowed it access to parts of macOS that require permission — such as accessing the microphone, webcam, or recording the screen — without ever getting consent.</p>
<p>XCSSET was <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/h/xcsset-mac-malware--infects-xcode-projects--uses-0-days.html">first discovered</a> by Trend Micro in 2020 targeting Apple developers, specifically their Xcode projects that they use to code and build apps. By infecting those app development projects, developers unwittingly distribute the malware to their users, in what Trend Micro researchers described as a &#8220;supply-chain-like attack.&#8221; The malware is under continued development, with more recent variants of the malware also targeting Macs running <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/d/xcsset-quickly-adapts-to-macos-11-and-m1-based-macs.html">the newer M1 chip</a>.</p>
<p>Once the malware is running on a victim&#8217;s computer, it uses two zero-days — one to steal cookies from the Safari browser to get access to a victim&#8217;s online accounts, and another to quietly install a development version of Safari, allowing the attackers to modify and snoop on virtually any website.</p>
<p>But Jamf says the malware was exploiting a previously undiscovered third-zero day in order to secretly take screenshots of the victim&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>macOS is supposed to ask the user for permission before it allows any app — malicious or otherwise — to record the screen, access the microphone or webcam, or open the user&#8217;s storage. But the malware bypassed that permissions prompt by sneaking in under the radar by injecting malicious code into legitimate apps.</p>
<p>Jamf researchers Jaron Bradley, Ferdous Saljooki, and Stuart Ashenbrenner explained in <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/">a blog post</a>, shared with TechCrunch, that the malware searches for other apps on the victim&#8217;s computer that are frequently granted screen sharing permissions, like Zoom, WhatsApp, and Slack, and injects malicious screen recording code into those apps. This allows the malicious code to &#8220;piggyback&#8221; the legitimate app and inherit its permissions across macOS. Then, the malware signs the new app bundle with a new certificate to avoid getting flagged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/">by macOS&#8217; in-built security defenses</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers said that the malware used the permissions prompt bypass &#8220;specifically for the purpose of taking screenshots of the user&#8217;s desktop,&#8221; but warned that it was not limited to screen recording. In other words, the bug could have been used to access the victim&#8217;s microphone, webcam, or capture their keystrokes, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how many Macs that the malware was able to infect using this technique. But Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that it fixed the bug in macOS 11.4, which was made available as an update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That’s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/deep-science/">This column</a> aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This edition, we have a lot of items concerned with the interface between AI or robotics and the real world. Of course most applications of this type of technology have real-world applications, but specifically this research is about the inevitable difficulties that occur due to limitations on either side of the real-virtual divide.</p>
<p>One issue that constantly comes up in robotics is how slow things actually go in the real world. Naturally some robots trained on certain tasks can do them with superhuman speed and agility, but for most that&#8217;s not the case. They need to check their observations against their virtual model of the world so frequently that tasks like picking up an item and putting it down can take minutes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s especially frustrating about this is that the real world is the best place to train robots, since ultimately they&#8217;ll be operating in it. One approach to addressing this is by increasing the value of every hour of real-world testing you do, which is the goal of <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/multi-task-robotic-reinforcement.html">this project over at Google.</a></p>
<p>In a rather technical blog post the team describes the challenge of using and integrating data from multiple robots learning and performing multiple tasks. It&#8217;s complicated, but they talk about creating a unified process for assigning and evaluating tasks, and adjusting future assignments and evaluations based on that. More intuitively, they create a process by which success at task A improves the robots&#8217; ability to do task B, even if they&#8217;re different.</p>
<p>Humans do it — knowing how to throw a ball well gives you a head start on throwing a dart, for instance. Making the most of valuable real-world training is important, and this shows there&#8217;s lots more optimization to do there.</p>
<p>Another approach is to improve the quality of simulations so they&#8217;re closer to what a robot will encounter when it takes its knowledge to the real world. That&#8217;s the goal of the Allen Institute for AI&#8217;s THOR training environment and its newest denizen, ManipulaTHOR.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156602" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manipulathor.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156602" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2156602 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manipulathor.gif" alt="Animated image of a robot navigating a virtual environment and moving items around." width="857" height="604" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allen Institute</p></div></p>
<p>Simulators like THOR provide an analogue to the real world where an AI can learn basic knowledge like how to navigate a room to find a specific object — a surprisingly difficult task! Simulators balance the need for realism with the computational cost of providing it, and the result is a system where a robot agent can spend thousands of virtual &#8220;hours&#8221; trying things over and over with no need to plug them in, oil their joints and so on.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last year, Instagram has added a slew of features to help independent creators make a living, like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram Shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping in Reels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-instagram-reels-and-live-insights-tools/">Instagram launched new Insights</a> for Reels and Live on its Professional Dashboard, giving businesses and creators essential data about the reach of their content. These tools will help Reels catch up with its competitor TikTok, which already offers users detailed analytics. As Instagram and TikTok continue trying to keep up with one another, it can only be a good thing for influencers and small businesses that use these platforms to bolster their income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, Instagram creators could only view publicly available metrics, like the views, likes, or comments on a Reel. Now, they will be able to access data like Accounts Reached, Saves, and Shares for their Reels. Instagram will also share the number of Peak Concurrent Viewers that tune in to watch their Live videos. Plus, in the Account Insights section of the app, Instagram will add breakdowns that show users what kinds of accounts they are reaching, and which content formats are generating their strongest engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For entrepreneurs and content creators whose businesses run on social commerce, these analytics might not change the game, but they certainly make it easier to play. Shopping in Reels makes in-app sales more convenient, but until now, scant data was available to help businesses tailor their Reels to reach potential customers. On the other hand, TikTok’s analytics have long provided creators with data on their videos’ average watch time, types of traffic sources, and performance by geographic location. The viral video app announced </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would work with specific brands, like the streetwear label Hype, to test in-app sales. This would deepen its competition with Instagram, but it’s still unclear when the feature will be widely available. So, Instagram’s Insights, combined with established in-app shopping, can create a perfect storm for content creators to better reach and monetize their target audiences.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always thought it was weird that there were no Insights for Reels. Sometimes it feels like shooting in the dark,” Quinn Jones told TechCrunch. Jones is one of the owners of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shop.kikay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIKAY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a handmade jewelry business based in Los Angeles. With over 90,000 followers across Instagram and TikTok, the Gen-Z creators rely on social media to expand their audience and increase their sales. Though KIKAY has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shop.kikay/video/6954415811838708997?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gone viral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on TikTok, Jones said that Instagram has been the best way for the small business to gain followers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Insights are definitely going to be useful going forward,” said Jones. “It’s currently hard to tell the actual effective reach your videos have, and seeing Insights means more feedback to help improve content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For influencers, these analytics are also helpful for collaborating with brands on sponsored content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been wanting Insights for Reels for the longest time. All we know now is views, likes, and comments,” said </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/caras_atl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara Cochran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an LGBTQ+ content creator and microinfluencer. She notes that brands have already been pushing creators to make videos on Reels ever since </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram redesigned its interface</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to place the short videos front-and-center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that they are rolling out analytics, I think we will see a lot of brands push for more and more Reels instead of just static posts,” she says. “I think it brings their products to life in a whole new way, and it almost works like a commercial for them instead of just a static ad.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram will begin rolling out Insights today. The company also says that over the coming months, it will add tools to help creators measure engagement over a preset time frame and begin to support Insights on desktop. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How’s your Monday going? If you’re Apple, the answer is probably somewhere between “very busy” to “gaaaaaaah.” The company just dropped a whole bunch of new OS updates today, including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, all ahead of the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off (virtually) on June 7.</p>
<p>Indeed, iOS and iPadOS are the headliners here &#8212; if for no other reason than the fact that they’ll impact the most devices. The public release of iOS/iPadOS 14.6 brings a couple of biggish features, including the addition of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/"> paid podcast subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">Apple Card Family</a>, both announced at a recent hardware event.</p>
<p>The former allows podcasters to charge for subscriptions to their show (imagine that!), with Apple taking a 30% commission for the first year. That will halve in a year. The latter, meanwhile, makes it possible for Apple Card owners to effectively split a card, with the various responsibilities that entails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Tim Cook noted at the time of announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning [of launching Apple Card] was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores when there were two holders of a credit card. One of you got the benefit of building a good credit history, and the other did not. We want to reinvent the way this works.</p></blockquote>
<p>MacOS 11.4 brings support for additional graphics cards, a number of bug fixes and, like the new iOS, support for paid podcast subs. Ditto that last part and Apple Card Family for the new watchOS 7.5, along with support for additional health features in Malaysia and Peru, as well as expense tracking for the Apple Card. TVOS/HomePod 14.6, meanwhile, are getting bug fixes and some color balance changes for the former.</p>
<p>Along with all of this, the company also announced the slate of programming for this year’s virtual WWDC. Things will kick off on June 7 at 10 a.m. PT with the keynote. That’s where the big news on the latest version of all of the above will be announced &#8212; and, hopefully, some hardware, as well. At 2 p.m. the company will be offering more information with its annual Platforms State of the Union.</p>
<p>The full schedule is available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soliduslabs.com/">Solidus Labs</a>, a company that says its surveillance and risk-monitoring software can detect manipulation across cryptocurrency trading platforms, is today announcing $20 million in Series A funding led by Evolution Equity Partners, with participation from Hanaco Ventures, Avon Ventures, 645 Ventures, the cryptocurrencies derivative exchange FTX,  and also a sprinkling of government officials, including former CFTC commissioner Chris Giancarlo and former SEC commissioner Troy Paredes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty great timing, given the various signals coming from the U.S. government just last week that it&#8217;s intent on improving its crypto monitoring efforts &#8212; such as the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s call for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/us-treasury-calls-for-stricter-cryptocurrency-compliance-with-irs.html">stricter cryptocurrency compliance</a> with the IRS.</p>
<p>Of course, Solidus didn&#8217;t spring into existence last week. Rather, Solidus was founded in 2017 by several former Goldman Sachs employees who worked on the firm&#8217;s electronic trading desk for equities. At the time, Bitcoin was only becoming buzzier, but while the engineers anticipated different use cases for the cryptocurrency, they also recognized that a lack of compliance tools would be a barrier to its adoption by bigger financial institution, so they left to build these.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast forward and today Solidus employs 30 people, has raised $23.75 million altogether, and is the process of doubling its head count to address growing demand. We talked with Solidus&#8217;s New York-based cofounder and CEO Asaf Meir &#8212; who was himself one of those former Goldman engineers &#8212; about the company late last week. Excerpts from chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are your customers?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We work with exchanges, broker dealers, OTC desks, liquidity providers, and regulators &#8212; anyone who is exposed to the risk of buying and selling cryptocurrencies crypto assets or digital assets, whatever you want to call them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you promising to uncover for them?</strong></p>
<p>AM: What we detect, largely speaking, is volume and price manipulation, and that has to do with wash trading, spoofing, layering, pump and dumps, and an additional growing library of crypto native alerts that truly only exist in our unique market.</p>
<p>We had a 400% increase in inbound demand over 2020 driven largely by two factors, I think. One is regulatory scrutiny. Globally, regulators have gone off to market participants, letting them know that they have to ask for permission not forgiveness. The second reason &#8212; which I like better &#8212; is the drastic institutional increase in appetite toward exposure for this asset class. Every institution, the first question they ask any executing platform is: &#8216;What are your risk mitigation tools? How do you make sure there is market integrity?&#8217;</p>

<p><strong> TC: We talked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/nft_users/">couple of months</a> ago, and you mentioned having a growing pipeline of customers, like the trading platform <a href="https://bittrex.com/">Bittrex</a> in Seattle. Is demand coming primarily from the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We have demand in Asia and in Europe, as well, so we will be our opening offices there, too.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is your former employer Goldman a customer?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I can&#8217;t comment on that, but I would say there isn&#8217;t a bank right now that isn&#8217;t thinking about how they&#8217;re going to get exposure to crypto assets, and in order to do that in a safe, compliant and robust way, they have to employ crypto-specific solutions.</p>
<p>Right now, there&#8217;s the new frontier &#8212;  the clients we&#8217;re currently working with, which are these crypto-pure exchanges, broker dealers. liquidity providers, and even traditional financial institutions that are coming into crypto and opening a crypto operation or a crypto desk. Then there&#8217;s the new <em>new</em> frontier; your NFTs, stablecoins, indexes, lending platforms, decentralized protocols and God knows what [else] all of a sudden reaching out to us, telling us they want to do the right thing, to ensure the users on their platform are well-protected, and that trading activities are audited, and [to enlist us] to prevent any manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does your subscription service work and who is building the tech?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We consume private data from our clients &#8212; all their training data &#8212;  and we then put it in our detection models, which we ultimately surface through insights and alerts on our dashboard, which they have access to.</p>
<p>As for who is building it, we have a lot of fintech engineers who are coming from Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Citi and bringing that traditional knowledge of large trading systems at scale; we also have incredible data scientists out of Israel whose expertise is in anomaly detection, which they are applying to financial crime, working with us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do these crimes look like?</strong></p>
<p>AM: When we started out, there was much more wholesale manipulation happening whether through wash trading or pump-and-dumps &#8212; things that are more easy to perform. What we&#8217;re seeing today are extremely sophisticated manipulation schemes where bad actors are able to exploit different executing platforms. We&#8217;re quite literally surfacing new alerts that if you were to use a legacy, rule-based system you wouldn&#8217;t be able to [surface] because you&#8217;re not really sure what you&#8217;re looking for. We oftentimes have an alert that we haven&#8217;t named yet; we just know that this type of behavior is considered manipulative in nature and that our client should be looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate a bit more about these new anomalies?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I&#8217;m conflicted about how much can we share of our clients&#8217; private data. But one thing we&#8217;re seeing is [a surge in] account extraction attacks, which is when through different ways, bad actors are able to gain access to an account&#8217;s funds and are able in a sophisticated way to trade out of the exchange or broker dealer or custodian. That&#8217;s happening in different social engineering-related ways, but we&#8217;re able, through account deviation and account profiling, to alert the exchange or broker dealer or financial institution we&#8217;re working with to avoid that.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re about detection and prevention, not about tracing [what went wrong and where] after the fact. And we can do that regardless of knowing even personal identifiable information about that account. It&#8217;s not about the name or the IP address; it&#8217;s all about the attributes of trading. In fact, if we have an exchange in Hong Kong that&#8217;s experiencing a pump-and-dump on a certain coin pair, we can preemptively warn the rest of our client base so they can take steps to prepare and protect themselves.</p>
<p><strong>TC: On the prevention front, could you also stop that activity on the Hong Kong exchange? Are you empowered by your clients to step in if you detect something anomalous?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We&#8217;re bomb sniffing dogs, so we&#8217;re not coming to disable the bot. We know how to take the data and point out manipulation, but it&#8217;s then up to the financial institution to handle the case.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists add value in a number of ways. For example, one of my business’ backers has a deep tech &#8220;pod&#8221; that generates events and content we are always welcomed to be a part of. Another one of our investors gives us full commercial support through its network of mentors that are there to support the business, not the VC.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Due diligence works both ways, and entrepreneurs shouldn’t be in a rush to take investment from anyone that offers it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I might not expect that from every VC, but if they promise those &#8220;assets&#8221; by saying that they are here to drive innovation and growth, then I expect them to deliver, just as I have to back up the claim of having a team of supersmart machine learning researchers.</p>
<p>They might know the forks in the road, directions to take, and who to speak to based on having been through the process with similar companies. They might have venture partners that can mentor you and a network of investors that can participate in follow-on rounds. That is where they add value.</p>
<p>The best ones will seek to connect with you personally. They’ll have prepared thoroughly beforehand and are brimming with questions. While they may have preconceived and potentially ill-informed ideas, they demonstrate enthusiasm by starting sentences with &#8220;what if,&#8221; and they leave me emboldened but contemplative. I fully expect to be provoked in the right way.</p>
<p>However, some also play God. One experience offered up a major warning sign, one that would make me walk on by.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to say my business has some outstanding investors who totally get it. Our investors&#8217; head of investment told representatives at one of New York&#8217;s top funds that one of their leading deep tech portfolio companies was coming to town for a &#8220;blitz meeting session.&#8221; They announced that they were committing to the round I was raising and that we were looking for a new lead investor.</p>
<p>So, put it this way: I wasn’t a guy who walked off the street with a crazy idea, but you might have thought otherwise, given the experience that followed. To be clear, I don’t expect all VCs to open their arms and embrace everyone, but there are rules of engagement.</p>
<h2>The transparency and value of DocSend</h2>
<p>After a very positive morning meeting, I’d scheduled a couple of hours for a quick chance to grab a breather at my hotel. Flicking through my phone, an email from the associate at the VC I was due to meet next pinged into my inbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Ofri, it’s Jessica [not her real name], really sorry, I’m not feeling great so am thinking I might cut the day short. I know you’re only in New York the next two days, so let’s catch up later on a call and next time you’re over I’m sure we can revisit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started composing a polite response: &#8220;Really sorry to hear that. Absolutely fine to reschedule. Let me know your availability, etc., etc.&#8221; In truth, I was irritated &#8212; this had been in the diary for two months and was one of six meetings scheduled. I was not sorry; I was annoyed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft have officially started to offer free rides to anyone traveling to get a COVID-19 vaccine, two weeks after the ride-hailing companies announced an agreement with the White House to offer the program.</p>
<p>The free rides will last through July 4, the date when President Joe Biden wants 70% of U.S. adults to be vaccinated. Lyft and Uber have previously told TechCrunch the companies will cover the costs of the free rides. The White House advised on the development and launch of the product. The White House also shared data on the more than 80,000 vaccination sites in the country, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Uber is giving riders four one-way rides up to $25 off each. Each of these two round trips must be three weeks apart between Monday and July 4, Uber said in a blog post. Riders can access the program by opening up the Uber app and tapping &#8220;vaccine&#8221; and then &#8220;get your free ride.&#8221; The free rides are offered between 6 am and 8 pm. Riders must enter the zip code of their appointment to find the location they are going to or coming from. The rider then selects the provider location and the ride option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156597" style="width: 157px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lyft-Vaccine-Rides-Gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156597" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2156597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lyft-Vaccine-Rides-Gif.gif?w=147" alt="Lyft Vaccine Rides Gif" width="147" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156597" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lyft</p></div></p>
<p>Lyft is offering two roundtrip rides up to $15 each trip. Lyft said if either ride costs more than $15 or if the rider tips their driver, those additional charges will hit their personal form of payment. Lyft is also requiring these free rides be three weeks apart.</p>
<p>The vaccine access program follows efforts by both companies to provide free and discounted rides to underserved communities as well as roll out features to make it easier to access vaccine information and point-of-distribution sites. Uber first rolled out a COVID-relief program in March to offer free rides and deliveries. In December, the company said it would give an additional 10 million free or discounted rides.</p>
<p>Uber announced in April that it was launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked off in December a universal vaccine access campaign, a coalition of partners that includes JPMorgan Chase, Anthem and United Way, to provide 60 million rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.</p>

If you want to place your ground-breaking, edge-cutting, envelope-pushing (no extra charge for clichés) early-stage startup in front of the world’s leading mobility movers, shakers and makers you gotta hustle. You have just one week left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2022&amp;utm_content=sua&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sua&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy one of our remaining three Startup Exhibitor Packages.</a></p>
<p>Here’s what the $380 package includes, plus a few suggestions on ways to take full advantage of the virtual platform’s capabilities and boost the opportunity factor. <strong>Note:</strong> Exhibitors must be pre-Series A, early-stage startups in the mobility field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual booth space</li>
<li>Lead generation</li>
<li>4 conference passes</li>
<li>Full event access</li>
<li>Videos on-demand</li>
<li>Breakout sessions</li>
<li>Networking with CrunchMatch</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopin, our virtual platform, lets you tap into your creativity. Include a product walk-through video — complete with links to your website and social media accounts — at your virtual booth. But get this. Your booth also includes live stream capability. Make the most of that opportunity. Share your screen, host a live demo or a product tutorial and moderate the chat area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maybe you’d like to host and live stream your own Q&amp;A session. Go for it. Or why not establish yourself as a subject matter expert? Choose your topic and combine your virtual booth and CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, to send invitations to the people you want to impress and get the conversation started. And of course, you can always schedule 1:1 video calls.</p>
<p>Since you’ll have four event passes, you and your team can tend to booth business and take in a range of presentations. Here are just two examples of what’s in store. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?promo=leftrail#878941bf-c22c-4ec4-ab2f-d8c0c15cb8ae">the event agenda</a> and plan your schedule now.</p>
<p><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision:</strong> Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</p>
<p><strong>AVs: Past, Present and Future:</strong> TechCrunch Mobility will talk to two pioneers, and competitors, who are leading the charge to commercialize autonomous vehicles. Karl Iagnemma, president of the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, and Chris Urmson, the co-founder and CEO of Aurora, will discuss — and maybe even debate — the best approach to AV development and deployment, swap stories of the earliest days of the industry and provide a few forecasts of what’s to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.futurefamily.com">Future Family</a>, a company we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/future-family/">a few times over the years</a>, makes fertility treatments more accessible. They pre-negotiate terms with fertility clinics to ensure there are no surprise fees, convert the often substantial upfront costs into a monthly payment plan, and give each user a dedicated Fertility Coach to help them navigate their journey.</p>
<p>This morning the company is announcing that it has raised a $9M round of funding as it expands the network of clinics it works with.</p>
<p>The company last raised $10M <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/future-family-raises-10m-to-make-fertility-treatments-more-affordable/">in a Series A back in 2018</a>, and they&#8217;re positioning this round an extension of that — a &#8220;Series A-1&#8221;, as they&#8217;re calling it — rather than a whole new round.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/future-family-raises-10m-to-make-fertility-treatments-more-affordable/">I&#8217;ve written before</a>, Future Family was inspired by founder Claire Tomkin&#8217;s own experiences:</p>
<blockquote><p>Future Family was born out of Claire Tomkins’ own experiences with the complexities and costs of fertility treatments. After spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on treatments involved with having her first child (with much of the cost coming as a surprise only revealed once the process had begun), Claire set out to build a better way. Future Family partners with clinics to work out all the pricing ahead of time and pays the bill upfront, ensuring there are no billing surprises down the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Claire tells me that, as it did for just about everyone, 2020 brought a whole new set of challenges for the company. In the early days of the pandemic, as a million questions about COVID-19 emerged, many fertility clinics closed their doors. And even as the clinics began reopening, with little certainty about where things might be in 9 months, many patients understandably held off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was definitely a tough year,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but I think we&#8217;re emerging in a good place.&#8221;</p>
<p>2021 is already looking like a different story, Claire tells me. &#8220;People had to sit on the sidelines,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People who have wanted to go forward with treatment, and now have waited 12 or more months&#8230; it&#8217;s gotten very busy.&#8221; According to their numbers, Claire expects the second half of 2021 to hit &#8220;record levels of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help with the sudden spike in demand, the company is adding more fertility clinics to its network, including CCRM — a fertility group with locations in Minneapolis, Houston, Denver, San Francisco, and a number of other major metros.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Norwegian conciliation council has ordered Tesla to pay thousands of dollars each to Model S owners after it found that a software update led to longer charging times, the Norwegian newspaper <a href="https://www.nettavisen.no/okonomi/tesla-domt-i-retten-risikerer-milliardutbetaling-til-norske-elbil-eiere/s/12-95-3424130203">Nettavisen</a> reported Monday. Drivers eligible for compensation under the ruling will receive 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each.</p>
<p>Thirty Tesla drivers brought a complaint to the conciliation council in December 2020, citing that charging times slowed down after a software update the previous year. The poorer performance affected Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured between 2013 and 2015.</p>
<p>Tesla sold about 10,000 Model S vehicles during that timeframe in Norway. That means Tesla faces an overall payout of up to 1.36 kroner ($163 million), Nettavisen said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla did not respond to the complaint prior to the judgement being issued and it has until May 30 to pay the fine. The company has the opportunity to appeal the ruling to the Oslo Conciliation Board by June 17.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Tesla has faced complaints on charging speeds in court. A Tesla owner in 2019 filed a lawsuit against the EV manufacturer in the Northern California federal court alleging fraud and decreased battery range following a software update.</p>
<p>Norway leads Europe in the number of EVs on the road, with battery electric vehicles accounting for 54% of all new vehicle sales in 2020, according to the Norweigan Road Federation. Audi e-trons were the most popular vehicle sold, followed by the Model 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we head into the summer of vaccination, travel is bound to start bouncing back from the lows of 2020, and Airbnb is betting it will look very different than it did in the pre-COVID era.</p>
<p>The home-sharing platform has introduced some big changes, across a wide variety of feature sets, that focus on flexibility for the guests and simplicity for the hosts. The end goal, according to Airbnb Head of Guest Experience <a href="https://twitter.com/samshank?lang=en">Sam Shank</a>, is to increase both the volume and diversity of the supply side of the operation.</p>
<p>To start, Airbnb has streamlined the process of becoming a host, minimizing the amount of steps it takes to get a listing up. Machine learning algorithms can also now automatically arrange photos based on guest appeal, and hosts are provided suggestions from Airbnb about the best titles and descriptions for their listing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156449" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156449" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2156449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?w=341" alt="" width="300" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png 866w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=768,1533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=769,1536 769w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156449" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbnb</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also adding new layers of data to the system, integrating with publicly available real estate data, so that hosts can simply enter their address and have information like number of bedrooms and bathrooms automatically filled in.</p>
<p>Other improvements to the hosting experience include a redesigned &#8216;Welcome to Hosting&#8217; hub, and a new Today tab that helps hosts keep track of new messages, tasks, etc.</p>
<p>On the guests side, Airbnb is doubling down on features around flexibility.</p>
<p>In February, for example, the company introduced flexible date search, letting people search for listings based on the type of trip, rather than the dates. Users can now search for a long weekend, a week-long trip, or a month-long trip.</p>
<p>Today, Airbnb announced that it is making its search product even more supple with &#8220;Flexible Matching&#8221; and &#8220;Flexible Destinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flexible Matching essentially adds wiggle room to a more specific search. For example, if a user searches for listings under $250/night, it might show listings that fit all other criteria but are priced slightly outside of that range. Or, if a user searches for a certain set of amenities, it might show a listing that&#8217;s only missing one.</p>
<p>Flexible Destinations allow a user to search for a certain type of listing regardless of the location. Think treehouses or beach side properties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brian [Chesky] said we have the right amount of hosts for this summer, but also that we have the capacity to add millions of hosts,&#8221; said Shank, explaining that changing how people find places expands their search to more diverse supply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were boiling down one big theme, it&#8217;s really around helping us get more diverse, unique supply and helping more people become very successful at being hosts, and recognizing the benefits of that,&#8221; said Shank. &#8220;There are financial benefits and also the chance to meet people from around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside flexible search updates and the improved host flow, Airbnb is also making upgrades to its community support department, doubling the number of support agents available on the phone this summer and expanding support coverage from 11 to 42 languages. The company has also redesigned the Help Center, with easier navigation, for both hosts and guests.</p>
<p>All told, this release includes more than 100 updates to the product.</p>
<p>Much of it was informed by Airbnb&#8217;s 2021 trend report, which showed that families both drove and diversified travel through the summer of 2020, with family travel growing from 27 percent of nights booked to 33 percent in the summer of 2021 globally. Of family travel, 42 percent of the nights booked were in rural destinations, which is up 10 percentage points from the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s work to expand its listing supply is not surprising given that it is now a public company, giving it a slightly less-forgiving investor pool to impress on a quarterly basis. Airbnb survived the COVID-19 pandemic better than some expected, thanks in part to users booking long stays while they quarantined. But now Airbnb needs to lead its industry into the post-COVID world if it wants to not only defend its market position, but also the very growth rates that helped it become the well-known brand that it remains today.</p>
<p>Of course, onboarding more hosts with more automated tooling opens to the door to quality risks. We&#8217;ll see how users respond to both more supply, and more computer-aided supply generation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, we held our first dedicated space startup event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a>, featuring some of the industry&#8217;s top founders and leaders, including <strong>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, Lockheed Martin&#8217;s Lisa Callahan, Amazon&#8217;s Dave Limp, NASA&#8217;s Kathy Leuders</strong> and many more. This year, we&#8217;re excited to announce we&#8217;re doing it again with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, happening virtually December 14-15.</p>
<p>Even in just the few short months between when we held <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a> in 2020 and now, there&#8217;s been a lot of major activity in the industry, including many launches and the addition of plenty more in-space infrastructure. NASA is signalling more strongly than ever that it wants to encourage the private sector to replace the International Space Station at the end of its useful life, and working with more startups than ever in it pursuit of ever-great public-private collaboration.</p>
<p>This year is also set to be one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with planned debut commercial or test orbital flights from companies including Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data gold rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren&#8217;t available before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll be diving into this much-expanded launch market, and in the many opportunities available in taking the exploding wealth of data from space-based sources and making those readily available for use in Earth at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> this year. We&#8217;re also looking forward to hearing more about what&#8217;s next in human space exploration, and in securing the stars for the safety and continued access of all.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="http://Fireflies.ai">Fireflies.ai</a> project is a good reminder that not every startup project goes from idea to unicorn-status in 48 minutes. Instead, the startup&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/krish_ramineni?lang=en">Krish Ramineni</a> told TechCrunch about how a period of interest in natural language processing (NLP), tinkering with a friend, a stint at Microsoft, and even working on Slack bots led him to helping found Fireflies.ai (Fireflies), a company that today announced a $14 million raise led by <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla</a>.</p>
<p>Fireflies is a two-part service. Its first point of business is recording and transcribing voice conversations. Things like video meetings, for example. Next, Fireflies wants to plug your voice data into other applications, helping its customers automate data entry, task creation and more.</p>
<p>Before today&#8217;s round, the startup had <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fireflies/company_financials">raised around $5 million</a>, including some micro-rounds, a stint in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">the Acceleprise accelerator</a>, and a $4.9 million seed round raised in late 2019. That investment included participation from Canaan Partners and well-known angel April Underwood.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Fireflies has raised more capital is not surprising, given how quickly it has accreted users. According to an interview with Ramineni, more than 10,000 teams use Fireflies today. In individual usage terms, some 35,000 organizations are represented amongst its user base.</p>
<p>As the company launched its product in early 2020, those results sound pretty good.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch was curious if revenue tracked with usage at Fireflies, as is sometimes the case. It does, Ramineni said, adding that his company grew its revenues 300% in the last six or seven months.</p>
<p>How did it manage such rapid growth while only having raised $5 million before, and with a team that is around 90% in its product and engineering teams? By pursuing everyone&#8217;s favorite: the bottoms-up sales model. In short, you can use Fireflies for free, but if you run out of meeting credits, other usage-based blockers or the need for different, paywalled functionality, you have to cough up for the product.</p>
<p>Folks are, it appears.</p>
<p>Fireflies is in fact an interesting hybrid of SaaS and usage-based pricing. The higher the paid tier that a user selects, the more minutes of transcription they are apportioned per month. But there are caps, limits that users can buy their way out of. TechCrunch asked Ramineni about it, with the CEO explaining that some customers want to ingest years of saved meetings. Our read is that despite work done by the startup to keep its infrastructure costs low, building pricing guardrails around product usage just makes sense for the startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mFhfZU27rU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/leverage-ai-to-optimize-customer-service-outcomes/">Leverage AI to optimize customer service outcomes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Leverage AI to optimize customer service outcomes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/leverage-ai-to-optimize-customer-service-outcomes/embed/#?secret=mFhfZU27rU" data-secret="mFhfZU27rU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company will sport SaaS-like gross margins, Ramineni confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fireflies wants to plug into more and more meeting platforms, and external software. You can currently link your Fireflies account to services like Zapier, Slack and your CRM. Over time, it&#8217;s not hard to see how the startup could take more direct commands from meetings, and help users better distribute, file and recall meeting information.</p>
<p>As someone with too many meetings, and too many notes documents spread out across the wasteland that is my Google Drive account, I get why people are using Fireflies today. But if the startup can build a no-code automation platform on top of my note taking? Then I will probably have to buy its service.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as a final note, working for a Major American Corporation can have its downsides. For example, Ramineni provided TechCrunch with a recording of our interview inside of Fireflies. This was nice, as I prefer to write from both my notes <em>and</em> transcripts to ensure that I am not missing things, or making mistakes. Fireflies kept asking me to log in. I tried with my corporate Google account. Which blocks such log-ins. So I kept getting the same prompt again and again.</p>
<p>Annoying? Sure. Lethal? No.</p>
<p>More when we can squeeze more growth data out of the startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM is leaning into TikTok. The satellite radio company and Pandora parent today announced a partnership with the social video platform to power several new initiatives, including a TikTok channel on SiriusXM, hosted TikTok playlists on Pandora and re-airings of Pandora LIVE events on TikTok.</p>
<p>The hosted playlists on Pandora are the first of the new initiatives to launch.</p>
<p>Starting today, popular TikTok creators will curate, host and promote their own Pandora playlists to their fans on TikTok, starting with Bella Poarch. The TikTok influencer, who now has 69.6 million followers, is best-known for her viral lip-sync video to &#8220;M to the B,&#8221; which blew up to become <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-poarch-tiktok-tyga-tattoo-navy-age-military-how-old-2020-10#she-first-went-mega-viral-with-her-m-to-the-b-video-which-became-the-most-liked-video-on-tiktok-2">the most-liked video on TikTok</a>. She also makes videos featuring singing, dancing and gaming content, among other things, and this month <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/tiktok-star-bella-poarch-said-her-new-song-build-a-btch-was-inspired-by-her-experience-of-being-bullied-as-a-child/articleshow/82637923.cms">released her first single</a>, &#8220;Build a B*tch,&#8221; which has broken into Spotify&#8217;s U.S. and Global Top 50 charts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of the time of writing, Poarch&#8217;s TikTok announcing her playlists, launched four hours ago, has 187.6K likes and 1 million views.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156510" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156510" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2156510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156510" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SiriusXM</p></div></p>
<p>Other &#8220;TikTok Tastemakers,&#8221; as SiriusXM has dubbed them, will release their own playlists in the months to come, including Christian Shelton and Nick Tangorra.</p>
<p>In addition, Pandora users will be able to tune into the <a href="https://www.pandora.com/playlist/PL:844424989710412:1756780791">TikTok Hits Playlist</a> at any time, which features popular and trending songs from TikTok.</p>
<p>Pandora is not the first music streamer to tap into TikTok&#8217;s influence for its own ends. Today, TikTok&#8217;s trends are driving songs up the Billboard charts and delivering Spotify streams as younger users look for their favorite TikTok songs on their preferred streaming music app. Spotify is now curating TikTok hits across editorial playlists like Viral Hits, big on the internet, Teen Beats and others. Apple Music also got in on the TikTok action when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-music-adds-10-new-playlists-aimed-at-gen-z-including-one-with-tiktok-hits/">introduced 10 new playlists</a> last year aimed at younger, Gen Z users. This included its own Viral Hits playlist, which pulls in top tracks from TikTok and other social media channels.</p>
<p>Among the other SiriusXM initiatives is the soon-to-launch TikTok Radio, a full-time music channel featuring tracks trending on TikTok, which will be presented by TikTok creators, influencers and DJs. The channel will debut later this summer, and will stream across SiriusXM, including in vehicles as well as in the SiriusXM app for desktop, mobile and connected devices.</p>
<p>TikTok fans will also later be able to watch selected re-airings of Pandora&#8217;s original events series, Pandora LIVE &#8212; a continuation of Pandora&#8217;s live events that went virtual during the pandemic. Pandora LIVE events feature artists from across genres, including country, rock, pop, R&amp;B and more, and have typically been re-aired, in part, the day after on SiriusXM.</p>
<p>Recently, Pandora LIVE celebrated Women&#8217;s History Month with a virtual event that included performances by Gwen Stefani and Jazmine Sullivan, which was re-aired on TikTok.</p>
<p>More Pandora LIVE events will soon do the same. SiriusXM says it will announce which events will re-air on TikTok throughout the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to collaborate with TikTok to create new content that brings the vibrancy of the leading social networking service to life on live radio and our streaming platforms,&#8221; said Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM president and chief content officer, in a statement. &#8220;The effect TikTok has on music, and pop culture in general, is undeniable. Our platforms will provide a unique opportunity for TikTok creators to engage with our listeners with content experiences that have never been done before in audio,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>SiriusXM&#8217;s move to partner more closely with TikTok could help it attract a younger set of listeners and subscribers, who may follow their favorite fans over to Pandora to tune into their playlist content. However, it&#8217;s unable to benefit from the full impact that working with TikTok could bring as the integrations are split across its two services, instead of being focused on just one.</p>
<p>Plus, SiriusXM, like others, still faces the looming threat of Resso, TikTok owner ByteDance&#8217;s own<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/resso-music-india-bytedance/"> music streaming app</a> that could one day make its way to the U.S. as part of its global expansion efforts. It has the potential to more closely tie TikTok&#8217;s music discovery features with streaming, impacting demand for rival services.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, TikTok sees the potential in partnering with a U.S. music streamer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to work with SiriusXM on TikTok Radio and to bring TikTok creators to Pandora to make the trends, music, and creative influences that are playing such a defining role in modern culture even more accessible,&#8221; said TikTok&#8217;s Global Head of Music, Ole Obermann, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to see this come to life and thank the SiriusXM team for being such an innovative and visionary collaborator,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December, Microsoft wrote a blog post highlighting “The year ahead for Surface Duo.” The news highlighted the dual-screen device’s upcoming availability outside the U.S. (including Canada, the U.K., France and Germany this year), as well as a smattering of features. It’s been pretty well acknowledged from most everyone who reviewed the device (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/microsoft-surface-duo-review/">us included</a>), that it’s very much a work in progress.</p>
<p>After making the feature available in beta, Microsoft today is issuing at update to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> for Android that will unlock some of the product’s entertainment potential. It’s something the company has discussed, and even previewed, but until now, it has remained one of a handful of blind spots.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A very cool update goes live for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SurfaceDuo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SurfaceDuo</a> customers today! Working with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> we&#39;ve put touch controls on to the second screen. More than 50 games are available to play with touch for <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@xboxGamePass</a> Ultimate Members. <a href="https://t.co/ZPIqQZXxS4">pic.twitter.com/ZPIqQZXxS4</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Panos Panay (@panos_panay) <a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1396844093133660173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The app works as you’d expect on the Duo &#8212; displaying the game on the top screen and transforming the bottom into a virtual version of an Xbox controller in the Compose Mode orientation. Obviously you can only go so far on that front with a touchscreen, but gaming is genuinely an application where having a second screen can really come in handy.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-gamepad-xbox-cloud-150042077.html">Engadget notes</a>, there are now more than 50 titles that support Xbox Touch Controls. Those will be available to users with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>A much-hyped &#8212; and eagerly anticipated &#8212; alternative to the foldable form factor, the Duo was a disappointment on launch. The company has since dropped the product’s price from $1,500 to $1,000 &#8212; not exactly a sign that it was selling well &#8212; but continued software support like this is, perhaps, an indication that the company is going to support the line going forward, in spite of early stumbles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Delhi police, controlled by India&#8217;s central government, on Monday evening visited two offices of Twitter &#8212; in the national capital state of Delhi and Gurgaon, in the neighboring state of Haryana &#8212; to seek more information about Twitter&#8217;s rationale to label one of the tweets by ruling partly BJP spokesperson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/"> as &#8220;manipulated media.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>An hour into the search attempt, Delhi Police Special Cell team, which investigates terrorism and other crimes, vacated Twitter&#8217;s offices because they were closed and there were no Twitter employees to engage with at the premises, according to live broadcast by several local news channels.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment. India, the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market, is a key overseas region for Twitter and many other American technology firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Delhi sent a notice to Twitter last week after the social network <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India’s ruling party BJP, as “manipulated media.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>In the tweet, Patra had claimed that Congress, the leading opposition party in India, was using a so-called “toolkit” to derail the Indian government’s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic. Alt News, a leading fact-checking organization in India, had <a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/">debunked Patra’s claim</a>.</p>
<p>Delhi police said it had received a complaint about the classification of Patra&#8217;s tweet, which it said it was investigating, and visited the offices to serve Twitter India&#8217;s head <a href="https://twitter.com/barandbench/status/1396842836226580484">a notice of the inquiry</a>. In a statement, the police said Twitter India&#8217;s managing director&#8217;s replies on the subject had been &#8220;very ambiguous.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Delhi Police is enquiring into a complaint in which clarification is sought from Twitter regarding the classification of a tweet by Shri Sambit Patra (BJP spokesman) as &#8216;manipulative&#8217;. It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such,&#8221; Delhi Police said in an earlier statement to local TV channels and <a href="https://twitter.com/Bhuvanbagga/status/1396841617294823430">other journalists</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information is relevant to the enquiry. Special Cell which is conducting the enquiry wants to find out the truth. Twitter which has claimed to know the underlying truth should clarify,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>In a follow-up statement, it disputed the characterization of today&#8217;s event as &#8220;raiding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several policy executives and the like questioned Delhi Police&#8217;s motives.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The move also comes at a time when Twitter and Facebook are inching closer to the deadline to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">comply with India&#8217;s new guidelines</a> to regulate social media.</p>
<p>In a new notice to both the firms, New Delhi warned that &#8220;failure to comply with IT rules could lead to loss of status and protections as intermediaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s development is the latest headache for the American firm, which has been struggling to maintain peace with the Indian government for several months.</p>
<p>After briefly complying with a New Delhi order early this year, the company faced heat from the government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">restoring accounts that had posted tweets critical of the Indian government’s policy</a> or the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The two faced off again publicly last month after New Delhi ordered Twitter and Facebook to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">take down posts</a> that were critical of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has a reported valuation over $5 billion and has raised more than $900 million since launch. The restaurant POS service has clearly been on a rapid growth trajectory, but how has the company navigated the market during the pandemic, which has pushed and pulled the restaurant industry unlike ever before?</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Extra Crunch Live (May 26 at 3pm ET</a>), we&#8217;ll find out. We&#8217;re sitting down with president and co-founder of Toast, Aman Narang, and one of the company&#8217;s investors, Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; Kent Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett is a partner out of the Cambridge office, focusing on consumer products and services as well as consumer-facing software. Before venture, Bennett was a creative executive for an entertainment production company called Licht Entertainment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His portfolio includes Bevi, Blue Apron, Xtime and, of course, Toast.</p>
<p>Narang spent seven years at Oracle, then Endeca, working on the development of the company&#8217;s business intelligence platform and mobile commerce platform.</p>
<p>He co-founded Toast in 2011 and has been growing the company ever since, adding new products and features to the restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Narang and Bennett to learn about how they came together for the company&#8217;s Series B deal, which Bessemer led. We&#8217;ll also talk about why Bennett wanted to bet on Toast, how they&#8217;ve worked together since and how they overcome challenges and disagreements. If we&#8217;re lucky, we may even get a peek at Toast&#8217;s original Series B pitch deck.</p>

<p>From there, we&#8217;ll head into the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off. Members of the audience can raise their hand to pitch live on the show, and Bennett and Narang will offer their feedback. It&#8217;s always a good time, but the only way to participate is to show up live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Register here for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a free event and accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members get access to the entire library of ECL episodes, all of which are packed with insights on how to raise and run a successful venture-backed company.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Register to hang out with myself, Narang and Bennett on Wednesday, May 26 at 3pm ET/noon PT.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[With a rising adjusted EBITDA result and improving adjusted EBITDA margins, Zeta has a profit story to tell investors along with possibly accelerating revenue growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to the working week. Are you ready to get our hands a little dirty this morning?</p>
<p>Good. We have an IPO to catch up on, one I should have kept up with in the past few weeks. Regardless, today we&#8217;re looking at Zeta Global&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001851003/000119312521167972/d379381ds1a.htm">IPO filing</a> ahead of its eventual pricing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Zeta Global is not a firm that I am very familiar with, but <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zeta-interactive/company_financials">because Crunchbase notes</a> that the New York-based startup has raised north of $600 million in private capital in the form of both equity financing and debt, it&#8217;s a unicorn worth understanding.</p>
<p>The gist is that Zeta ingests and crunches lots of data, helping its users market to their customers on a targeted basis throughout their individual buying lifecycles. In simpler terms, Zeta helps companies pitch customers in varied manners depending on their own characteristics.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You can imagine that, as the digital economy has grown, the sort of work Zeta Global supports has only expanded. So, has Zeta itself grown quickly? And does it have an attractive business profile? We want to know. We&#8217;ll also poke around its final private valuation so that we can see how much that number matches up &#8212; or doesn&#8217;t &#8212; to its recent financial results.</p>
<p>Sound good? Let&#8217;s find out why Staley Capital, GCP Capital Partners, Franklin Square Group, GPI Capital and others backed the firm.</p>
<h2>Zeta Global&#8217;s business in brief</h2>
<p>It can be useful to dissect a company&#8217;s marketing materials not just to see how well they describe themselves, but also to grok how they want to be perceived in the marketplace. Zeta is one such case.</p>
<p>Via its S-1 filings, here&#8217;s how it wants you to understand its business:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zeta is a leading omnichannel data-driven cloud platform that provides enterprises with consumer intelligence and marketing automation software. We empower our customers to target, connect and engage consumers through software that delivers personalized marketing across all addressable channels, including email, social media, web, chat, connected TV (“CTV”) and video, among others.</p></blockquote>
<p>If that didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense, it&#8217;s OK.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the early-stage VC firm is announcing its largest fund closures to date: Kaszek Ventures V, a $475 million early-stage fund, believed to be the largest vehicle of its kind ever raised in the region, and Kaszek Ventures Opportunity II, a $525 million for later-stage investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since 2011, Kaszek has backed 91 companies, which the firm says collectively have raised more than $10 billion in capital. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With backers like Tiger Global, LatAm crypto exchange Bitso raises $250M at a $2.2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/latam-crypto-exchange-bisto-raises-250m-from-tiger-coatue-at-a-2-2b-valuation/embed/#?secret=2STSOjM8Hd" data-secret="2STSOjM8Hd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MercadoLibre co-founder Hernán Kazah and the company’s ex-CFO, Nicolas Szekasy, founded Kaszek a decade ago after leaving LatAm’s answer to Amazon. Fun fact: The firm’s name comes from a combination of their two last names: Ka-Szek. Rounding out the team are Nicolas Berman (former VP at MercadoLibre), Santiago Fossatti, Andy Young and Mariana Donangelo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek founded its first fund in 2011, raising $95 million, an impressive sum at that time. Funds II and III closed in 2014 and 2017, raising $135 million and $200 million, respectively. By 2019, Kaszek had closed on its fourth fund, raising $375 million and its first Opportunity Fund, reserving $225 million for later-stage investing in existing portfolio companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s notable that in its fifth fund, Kaszek is reserving more of its new capital to fund later-stage investments &#8212; a testament to its faith in its current portfolio. Both funds, according to Kaszek, were “several times oversubscribed&#8221; with demand coming globally from university endowments, global foundations, technology funds and several tech entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley-based Sequoia Capital has been an LP since day one via </span><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/heritage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Heritage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its community investment office. Also, Connecticut-based Wesleyan University is an LP, with Chief Investment Officer Anne Martin describing the founding team as “internet pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there has been an explosion of global investor interest in Latin American startups. The region’s startup scene is seeing a surge of fundraises, with new unicorns emerging with increasing regularity. And Kaszek has been at the heart of it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been at the epicenter of the technology ecosystem in Latin America since 1999, first with MercadoLibre and now with Kaszek, and have witnessed firsthand the extraordinary  evolution that the sector has experienced since its infancy,” said managing partner and co-founder Kazah. “When MercadoLibre started, the internet penetration was less than 3% and it was mostly dial-up connections. Today, more than two decades later, technology secular trends are stronger than ever before as we are experiencing an acceleration towards digitalization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek has not yet backed any companies out of its newest investment vehicles, but plans to put money in 20 to 30 companies out of its early-stage fund, with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $25 million, according to Kazah. Its Opportunity Fund investments will be more concentrated, with the firm likely backing 10 to 15 companies with check sizes ranging from $10 million to $35 million. The firm is industry agnostic, with Kazah saying it considers “any industry where technology is playing a transformational role.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General partner and co-founder Szekasy says that in the firm’s first funds, Kaszek mostly backed first-time entrepreneurs. But in its last early-stage fund, it began backing more teams led by repeat entrepreneurs or by founders spawned out of some of the region’s more successful startups. As many VC firms do, Kaszek describes its investment strategy as providing more than capital, but also becoming partners with the founders of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Creditas founder and CEO Sergio Furio describes the firm as “the co-founder I did not have.”</span></p>
<p>While the firm declined to comment on performance, a source with firsthand knowledge of its metrics over the years tells TechCrunch that it&#8217;s quite impressive with MOICS ranging from 19.2 for Fund I, 10.5 for Fund II, 4.9 for Fund III and 2.6 for Fund IV &#8212; with an aggregate IRR for all funds above 55%.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s active <a href="https://www.kaszek.com/companies/">portfolio</a> currently consists of 71 companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek was one of the earliest investors in Brazilian neobank Nubank, just one of nine unicorns it has helped build over the years. Other unicorns it’s backed include MadeiraMadeira, PedidosYa, proptech startup QuintoAndar, Gympass, Loggi, Creditas, Kavak and Bitso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s investments have largely concentrated in Brazil and Mexico (the two startup hotspots of the region) and Colombia, but the firm has also backed startups based in other countries in the region such as DigitalHouse (which was formed in Argentina), NotCo (originally founded in Chile) and Kushki (launched first in Ecuador). It has people on the ground in its home base of Brazil, as well as Mexico, the United States, Argentina and Uruguay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have always believed that the strong secular technology trends that we were seeing 20 years ago, evident in the U.S. and a little later in China, were going to happen in Latin America,” Kazah told TechCrunch. “&#8230;Everything we predicted back then was going to happen, happened. Maybe it happened later, but it was also much larger and more comprehensive than what we had initially imagined. That is typically what happens with innovations, they take off later than you think, but fly much higher than you ever imagined.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might have thought that with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">more than 300 companies joining this year’s winter batch of Y Combinator</a>, the investor interest might have thinned. Well, it’s 2021 and investors are hopping around like crazy to invest in ideas that push the boundaries in fields far-flung from enterprise SaaS.</p>
<p>Case in point today: <a href="https://www.gridware.io">Gridware</a>. It’s a startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/gridware-is-building-early-detection-sensors-for-power-grid-failures-and-wildfires/">I profiled earlier this year when it had just started up in its YC batch</a>. As I wrote, it wants to save our power grids from the ravages of climate change:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its approach is to use a small, sensor-laden box that can be installed to a power pole with just four screws. Gridware’s package contains microphones and other sensors to sense the ambient environment around a power pole, and it uses on-board AI/ML processing to listen for anomalies and report them to the relevant managers as appropriate.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hardware, IoT, infrastructure, utilities and government are five keywords you probably most would have wanted to avoid when pitching investors even a few years ago. But with power disappearing in states like California and Texas for stretches of time, investors have perhaps finally realized there is an opportunity to save the planet and make a bit of money here.</p>

<p>Gridware today announced that it has raised $5.3 million in a seed round led by Priscilla Tyler of True Ventures and Seth Bannon and Shuo Yang of Fifty Years. CEO and co-founder Tim Barat said fundraising was quite fierce. “We had 130 investors reach out to us, and I wasn’t even able to get back to some of them yet … [I’m] still going back through the emails,” he said. “Even before Demo Day, we had raised a significant portion of our round.”</p>
<p>Barat and the Gridware team were looking for investors who were mission-driven and really understood the timeline it would take to build the company. “You see a lot of investors say they are mission-driven … but when it comes time to put their money where their mouth is, it often goes to consumer technology where it is safer,” he said. Tyler at True leads climate investing for the firm, and True has made a variety of bets in the space. Fifty Years focuses on startups tackling the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">UN’s list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/gridware-is-building-early-detection-sensors-for-power-grid-failures-and-wildfires/">read more about the company’s product and market in my profile from three months ago</a>, but with the new funding, Gridware wants to double down on building a very intentional team capable of tackling this tough market. “Dealing with this multi-stakeholder business model is very challenging, so bringing on people with the experience, knowledge and wits to deal with this kind of environment is key,” Barat said.</p>

<p>As I explored recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">the disaster response space is probably one of the toughest markets in the world to sell into</a>. Barat acknowledged the intrinsic difficulty, but sees huge potential in the long run. “One of the things that I have observed with the companies being successful — they really spend the time to meet as many stakeholders as possible,” he said. “With consumer, you can stand in front of a shopping mall and talk to 100 customers in a day [but] in govtech, getting 100 meetings even within a year is a huge accomplishment.”</p>
<p>The company will be re-opening its Bay Area office in Walnut Creek on June 1.</p>
