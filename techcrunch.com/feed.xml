										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not even half a year since crypto exchange Bitpanda announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/neobroker-bitpanda-raises-170m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-take-its-trading-platform-beyond-crypto/">$170M Series B</a> &#8212; when, back in March, Austria&#8217;s first unicorn was being valued at $1.2 billion. Today it&#8217;s topping that: Announcing a $263M Series C, led by Peter Thiel&#8217;s Valar Ventures, with the fintech startup now valued at a whopping $4.1BN &#8212; more than 3x its earlier valuation as crypto trading continues cooking on gas.</p>
<p>The round was signed earlier this month, just four months after the business gained unicorn status. Other participating investors include Alan Howard and REDO Ventures, with existing investors LeadBlock Partners and Jump Capital also joining the Series C.</p>
<p>There are a number of exchanges and trading platforms targeted at retail investors, of course, including some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">big US-based players</a>. But Bitpanda has been making its mark by being Europe-focused, with offices and physical tech hubs located in eight cities across the region, including Vienna, Barcelona, Berlin, Krakow, London, Madrid, Milan, and Paris.</p>
<p>The platform has a further twist in that it lets its ~3 million users easily invest (commission-free) in precious metals (like gold) or in any established stock they fancy &#8212; in addition to encouraging individuals to hop aboard the crypto rollercoaster, which was its first focus. (The minimum investment amount set by the platform is €1.)</p>
<p>Despite diversification beyond crypto, a spokeswoman confirmed to us that crypto trading remains &#8220;the preferred choice&#8221; for Bitpanda&#8217;s current users, noting the Stocks trading product is still in beta. &#8220;With Bitpanda Stocks, we introduced a new way of investing in stocks and ETFs; it enables investing 24/7, any time, day or night. This is still in a beta phase, we’re adding constantly new assets. That said, stock trading is slowly picking up and increasing its share in overall trading,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>More recently (in June) Bitpanda expanded into the b2b market &#8212; with a white label platform offering that lets other fintechs and banks offer trading to their own clients.</p>
<p>This combination of products and regional focus has helped the platform pile on new users in short order: Bitpanda says it&#8217;s &#8220;on track&#8221; to achieve 6x customer growth year over year, with revenues projected to increase sevenfold in 2021 vs the previous year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C funding will be used for international expansion and growth, per a press release, as well as going on further beefing up headcount (500+ strong at this stage), as well as on gearing up for further scaling of the business.</p>
<p>Tech and product are also set to get juiced with Series C funds.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO, said: “We started Bitpanda in 2014 with a clear vision: To bring investing closer to everyone, everywhere. We wouldn’t be here today without the efforts of our talented team members who are constantly &#8216;rolling up their sleeves&#8217; to make things happen. We’re grateful to share our journey with these incredible people — and that’s why a key area of focus for us is to keep strengthening our team by bringing onboard world-class talent.We’re also grateful for the vote of confidence received from our investors, old and new, in this investment round. We look forward to working together as we shape the future of finance and grow Bitpanda into the #1 investment platform in Europe<br />
and beyond”.</p>
<p>Bitpanda&#8217;s spokeswoman also told us that international expansion and growth are &#8220;key priorities&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We’ll keep building the team, opening new offices, and launching new products as we design for scale and optimise for growth. This also means strengthening Bitpanda’s position in existing markets &#8212; such as in the DACH region, Spain, France, Italy, and Poland, and also enter new markets, such as the UK or the markets in Central and Eastern Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Andrew McCormack, founding partner of Valar Ventures, said: “We believed in Bitpanda’s potential from the beginning and we are impressed by the results that Eric, Paul, Christian and the Bitpanda team have achieved. With more than 1.2 million users acquired in the first half of 2021, impressive net revenue growth and world-class executive hires, Bitpanda stands as the living proof that hypergrowth can be achieved in a sustainable way. We’re excited to further work together to bring the world of investing at the fingertips of everyone, anywhere.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness platform <a href="https://ultrahuman.com">Ultrahuman </a>has officially announced a $17.5 million Series B fund raise, with investment coming from early stage fund Alpha Wave Incubation, Steadview Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Blume Ventures and Utsav Somani’s iSeed fund.</p>
<p>A number of founders and angel investors also participated in the Bangalore-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series B, including Tiger Global’s Scott Schleifer, Deepinder Goyal (CEO of Zomato), Kunal Shah (CEO of Cred), and Gaurav Munjal and Romain Saini (the CEO and co-founders of unacademy), among others. The latest tranche of funding brings its total raised to date to $25M.</p>
<p>While the subscription platform has been around since 2019, offering a fairly familiar blend of home workout videos, mindfulness content, sleep sessions and heart rate tracking (integrating with third party wearables like the Apple Watch), its latest fitness tool looks rather more novel &#8212; as it&#8217;s designed for monitoring metabolic activity by tracking the user&#8217;s glucose levels (aka, blood sugar).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Keeping tabs on blood sugar is essential for people living with diabetes. But in the US alone millions of people are prediabetic &#8212; meaning they have a higher than normal level of blood glucose and are at risk of developing diabetes, though they may not know it yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More broadly, Ultrahuman claims over a billion people in the world suffer from a metabolic health disorder &#8212; underlining the scale of the potential addressable market it&#8217;s eyeing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">H</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aving sustained high blood glucose is associated with multiple health issues so managing the condition with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise is advisable. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lifestyle changes can reduce elevated blood glucose and shrink or even avoid negative health impacts &#8212; such as by averting the risk of a prediabetic person going on to develop full blown diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But k</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nowing what type of diet and exercise regime will work best for a particular person can be tricky &#8212; and involve a lot of frustrating trial and error &#8212; since people&#8217;s glucose responses to different</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> food items can differ wildly. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These responses depend on a person&#8217;s metabolic health &#8212; which in turn depends on individual factors like microbiome diversity, stress levels, time of day, food ingredient and quality</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. (See also: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">Personalized nutrition startups like Zoe</a> &#8212; which is similarly paying mind to blood glucose levels but as one component of a wider play to try to use big data and AI to decode the microbiome.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With metabolic health being so specific to each of us there&#8217;s a strong case for continuous glucose monitoring having widespread utility &#8212; certainly if the process and price-point can be made widely accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, Ultrahuman is having a go at productizing the practice for a fitness enthusiast market &#8212; launching its first device in beta back in June &#8212; although the price-point it&#8217;s targeting is starting out fairly premium. </span></p>
<p>The product (a wearable and a subscription service) &#8212; which it&#8217;s branded &#8216;Cyborg&#8217; &#8212; consists of<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a skin patch that extracts glucose from the interstitial fluid under the skin, per founder and CEO, Mohit Kumar, with the data fed into a companion app for analysis and visualization.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190321" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190321" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2190321" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png 4437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190321" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Ultrahuman</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The patch tracks the wearer&#8217;s blood glucose levels as they go about their day &#8212; eating, exercising, sleeping etc &#8212; with the biomarker used to trigger the app to</span> nudge the user to &#8220;optimize your lifestyle&#8221;, as Ultrahuman&#8217;s website puts it &#8212; such as by alerting the user to a high blood glucose event and suggesting they take exercise to bring their level down.</p>
<p>If the product lives up to its promise of continuous glucose monitoring made easy, lovers of junk food could be in for a rude awakening as they&#8217;re served fast feedback on how their body copes (or, well, doesn&#8217;t) with their favorite snacks&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We use medical grade sensors that have been used in the sports technology domain for the last 6-7 yrs with decent accuracy levels,&#8221; says Kumar when we ask about the specifics of the wearable technology it&#8217;s using. (</span>The sensing hardware is being &#8216;worn&#8217; here in the sense that it&#8217;s directly attached to (i.e. stuck into/on) bare skin.)</p>
<p>While Ultrahuman&#8217;s platform has plenty more vanilla fitness content, the company is now billing itself as a &#8220;metabolic fitness platform&#8221; &#8212; putting the nascent product front and center, even though the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> glucose tracking subscription service remains in closed beta for now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is operating a waitlist for sign-ups as it continues to hone the technology. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">  </span></p>
<p>Ultrahuman touts &#8220;thousands&#8221; of people signed up and waiting to get their hands on the glucose tracker service &#8212; and says it&#8217;s seeing 60% week over week growth in sign ups, with wider availability of the product slated for &#8220;early 2022&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some of the Series B cash will be used to make improvements to the quality of the glucose biomarkers ahead of a full product launch.</span></p>
<p>On the enhancements side, Kumar tells TechCrunch the team is exploring &#8220;other form factors and other types of sensors that could help us capture glucose in a more accurate way and for a longer duration than 14 days&#8221;, as they work to hone the wearable. (The current version of the skin-worn sensor only lasts two weeks before it must be replaced with another patch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to add more biomarkers like HRV [heart-rate variability], sleep zones and respiratory rate to help people understand the impact of metabolic health on their recovery/sleep and vice-versa,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman says it decided to focus on tracking glucose as its &#8220;main biomarker&#8221; as it can be used as a proxy for quantifying a number of fitness and wellness issues &#8212; making it a (potentially) very useful measure of individual health signals.</p>
<p>Or provided the startup&#8217;s technology is able to detect changes to glucose levels with enough sensitivity to be able to make meaningful recommendations per user.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glucose is interesting because it is a real-time biomarker that&#8217;s affected by exercise, sleep, stress and food,&#8221; says Kumar, adding: &#8220;We are able to help people make lifestyle changes across many vectors like nutrition, sleep, stress and exercise vs being unidimensional. It is also highly personalized as it guides you as per your body&#8217;s own response.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gives some examples of how the product could help users by identifying beneficial tweaks they could make to their diet and exercise regimes &#8212; such as figuring out which foods in their current diet yield &#8220;a healthy metabolic response&#8221; vs those that &#8220;need more optimization&#8221; (aka, avoiding the dreaded sugar crash). Or by helping users identify &#8220;a great meal window&#8221; for their lifestyle &#8212; based in their body&#8217;s glucose consumption rate.</p>
<p>Other helpful nudges he suggests the service can provide to sensor-wearing users &#8212; with an eye on athletes and fitness fanatics &#8212; is how best to fuel up before exercise to perform optimally.</p>
<p>Optimizing the last meal of the day to improve sleep efficiency is another suggestion.</p>
<p>If Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg can do all that with a (bearably) wearable skin patch and a bit of clever algorithmic analysis it could take the quantified self trend to the next level.</p>
<p>A simple stick-on sensor-plus-app that passively amplifies internal biological signals and translates individual biomarkers into highly actionable real-time personalized health insights could be the start of something huge in preventative healthcare.</p>
<p>Again, though, Ultrahuman&#8217;s early pricing suggests there will be some fairly hard limits on who is able to tap in here.</p>
<p>Early adopters in the closed beta are shelling out $80 per month for the subscription service, per Kumar. And &#8212; at least for now &#8212; the startup is eyeing adding more bells and whistles, rather than fewer. &#8220;[Product pricing] will mostly be in the same range but may introduce more services/premium features on top of this,&#8221; he confirms.</p>
<p>The (typically higher) cost of eating healthily and having enough leisure time to be able to look after your body by taking exercise are other hard socioeconomic limits that won&#8217;t be fixed by a wearable, no matter how smart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Many Southeast Asian digital businesses run into obstacles when seeking early-stage growth financing. They might not want to sell equity in their company, but often struggle to secure working capital loans from traditional financial institutions. That’s where Singapore-based <a href="https://jenfi.com/">Jenfi</a> comes in, providing revenue-based financing of up to $500,000 with flexible repayment plans that co-founder and chief executive officer Jeffrey Liu refers to as “growth capital as a product.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/revenue-based-financing-the-next-step-for-private-equity-and-early-stage-investment/">revenue-based financing is gaining traction in many other markets</a>, Liu told TechCrunch that Singapore-based Jenfi is the first company of its kind focused on Southeast Asia. The startup announced today that it has raised a $6.3 million Series A led by Monk’s Hill Ventures. Participants included Korea Investment Partners and Golden Equator Capital, 8VC, ICU Ventures and Taurus Ventures. The company previously raised $25 million in debt financing from San Francisco-based Arc Labs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jenfi wants to solve small business lending in Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/jenfi-wants-to-solve-small-business-lending-in-southeast-asia/embed/#?secret=c350sdBV3L" data-secret="c350sdBV3L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p2">Jenfi works primarily with “digital-native” companies, including SaaS providers and e-commerce sellers. Some of its clients include Tier One Entertainment, Pay With Split and Homebase. Jenfi hasn’t disclosed how much non-dilutive financing it&#8217;s provided so far, but its goal is to deploy $15 million by July 2022. It claims that the average Jenfi customer experienced compounded sales growth of about 26.5% over three months, 60% over six months and 156% over twelve months.</p>
<p class="p2">The aggregate sales of companies in its portfolio is currently more than $30 million, and Jenfi expects that the capital it has already deployed will help them generate $47 million in sales, or a 156% increase by July 2021.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Liu launched Jenfi with Justin Louie in 2019, after seeing how traditional financial institutions were lagging behind <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/">Southeast Asia’s digital boom</a>. The two previously founded GuavaPass, the fitness studio membership platform that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/06/fitness-marketplace-classpass-acquires-competitor-guavapass/">acquired by ClassPass in 2019</a>. Jenfi&#8217;s creation was motivated by some of the challenges Liu and Louie faced while financing a high-growth startup focused on Asian markets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Jenfi’s application process is completely online and in some cases, companies have received financing in less than 24 hours, though it typically takes a few days. This is another benefit over traditional working capital loans or private equity financing, which can take months to complete, making it difficult for companies to respond quickly to revenue growth opportunities. For example, an e-commerce company may need quick working capital to purchase more inventory if it suddenly gets a lot of demand for a certain product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lending startup Portal Finance nabs $200 million for small business loans in Latin America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/03/lending-startup-portal-finance-nabs-200-million-for-small-business-loans-in-latin-america/embed/#?secret=AZWDVD6i54" data-secret="AZWDVD6i54" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p2">Some of Jenfi’s Series A will also be used to develop more integrations for its proprietary risk assessment engine, which analyzes how efficiently companies use their growth spending. Currently, it can tap into information from bank accounts; software like Xero or Quickbooks; payment gateways including Stripe and Braintree; e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Shopee and Lazada; and Facebook Ads and Google Ads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Instead of fixed installment repayment plans, Jenfi gives companies more flexible target repayment plans and charges them a flat fee based on the amount of financing they received, their monthly sales and how many months it will take to pay back the loan. Jenfi continues analyzing the data sources provided by companies, so it can tell if a client potentially needs more capital or an adjustment to their repayment terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, Jenfi’s plan to move beyond financing and also provide tools to help businesses. “We see ourselves as partners in our portfolio companies’ growth,” said Liu.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Since Jenfi taps into a mix of data sources—including bank accounts, accounting software and digital advertising platforms, it can use that same information to identify opportunities. Part of Jenfi’s Series A funding will be used to develop automated analytics. For example, the platform would be able to identify an advertising opportunity with high ROI on Google Ads and notify the company, asking if they want to apply for more capital to finance the campaign.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p-rich_text_section">EV startup Canoo has hired hundreds of employees and is homing in on a production date, but critical milestones including landing a battery supplier remain, according to the company&#8217;s second quarter earnings report.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Canoo&#8217;s earnings report comes just a few weeks after the company&#8217;s first investor relations day when it named Dutch company<a href="https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner"> VDL Nedcar as its contract manufacturing partner</a> for its lifestyle vehicle. At the time, Canoo estimated the Nedcar facility would build up to 1,000 units in 2022 for U.S. and European markets, with a target of 15,000 units in 2023. During Monday&#8217;s earnings call, CEO Tony Aquila said the company is now expecting 25,000 units in 2023.</p>
<p>Canoo also provided updates on its plans to build a U.S.-based factory, which it describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; for its pickup truck and multipurpose delivery vehicle. In June, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">EV startup announced plans to build its first factory in Oklahoma</a>. The state has committed $300 million in non-dilutive financial incentives to support the facility and Phase 2 of manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This two-pronged strategy is important for a few reasons,&#8221; Aquila said during Monday&#8217;s earnings call. &#8220;As a new OEM, working with Nedcar will allow us to refine our manufacturing process. While augmenting our production expertise, which will be deployed in our Oklahoma manufacturing plant, it will allow us to geographically diversify our manufacturing operations and position us to increase our commitments, products and volumes to adapt to changing market demands and build flexibility in distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila said about a third of Oklahoma&#8217;s investment will be available within the first 36 months. These funds will help the company progress as it moves into its Gamma phase, which means Canoo is getting ready to launch. Year over year, Canoo upped its workforce from 230 to 656 total employees, 70% of which are hardware and software engineers. The startup&#8217;s operating expenses have increased from $19.8 million to $104.3 million YOY, with the majority of that increase coming from R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The ramping up of expenses pre-revenue is a signal that Canoo is pushing forward on its production goals, but there&#8217;s still work to be done before construction begins on the Oklahoma factory. Aquila said Canoo is in the final process of selecting a construction manager, an architect and an engineering firm and will likely have more updates on the construction progress by next quarter.</p>
<p>The company is still working on making a final decision for a battery partner in the third quarter, a move that is becoming increasingly important as more legacy OEMs work to control their supply chain with battery joint ventures. Canoo is also struggling with semiconductor supply chain issues, as is the rest of the industry, but says its streamlined manufacturing process means its vehicles will require less chips to function.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On IR day, Canoo announced that it had completed 500,000 miles of beta testing. As of June 30, Aquila said the company has locked in engineering and design to commence &#8220;gamma&#8221; builds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also sourced 87% of components, compared to 74% in the first quarter of the year, and excluding bulk material, we are 95% sourcing complete,&#8221; said Aquila. &#8220;Our CTO and his team have completed engineering design for 67% of the lifestyle vehicle components and have moved those into tooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila said Canoo would begin its countdown to standard operating procedure for its lifestyle vehicle during the fourth quarter. The lifestyle vehicle is probably closer to production, but Aquila said out of the 9,500 non-binding refundable preorders, preorders for Canoo&#8217;s other two vehicles, the pickup truck and the multipurpose delivery vehicle, are the most popular.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 16, 2021. While the world deals with myriad issues, we’re sticking to our usual remit. Hugs and love to everyone, and here’s hoping for a better tomorrow. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">How Nuro is taking on Google, the world:</a> </strong>The race to build commercial-ready self-driving cars is big, well funded and competitive. And companies are taking diverging paths in their approach to the autonomous driving question. Nuro is one such company, and TechCrunch has the inside scoop in our latest EC-1. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">Tesla under investigation for Autopilot crashes:</a> </strong>Speaking of self-driving cars, Tesla’s efforts on the project are in the spotlight after a number of collisions between the company’s cars and parked first-responder vehicles. Tesla’s diver assistance program appears to be the culprit. How you feel about the inquiry will depend on whether you hold Tesla stock, but the situation underscores just how hard it is to get self-driving, full or not, to work in the wild.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-hyperactive-late-stage-market-should-keep-the-startup-investing-game-afoot/"><strong>Chime, Carta and Discord:</strong></a> As U.S. unicorns raise new mega-rounds, or work to close their next epic funding round, TechCrunch wondered what the rash of startups worth $10 billion or more could mean for startups earlier in their lifecycle. The news is good for startups and their founders alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"><strong>Guilded sells to Roblox:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Microsoft failed to acquire Discord, but Roblox didn’t miss when it came to Guilded. Admittedly, Guilded is a far smaller company than Discord, but the two startups play in the same space, so the Roblox deal really does matter. The market for gamer chat apps is probably big enough to support a few players, but Roblox, flush with cash, was more than happy to pony up for Guilded, which raised just over $10 million while private.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tropic-picks-up-25m-to-streamline-software-procurement-experiences/"><strong>Tropic raises $25M for better software procurement:</strong></a> The pandemic taught the world that software gets paid for. Why? Because without it business literally stops. Software companies did well during the pandemic thanks to the centrality to regular operations that their business enjoyed. But no one wants to overpay. That’s where Tropic comes in &#8212; and now the startup that wants to help others spend less on software has $25 million to play with.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/"><strong>Shopistry raises $2M for better headless commerce:</strong></a> We are presuming that this startup’s name is pronounced <em>SHOP-istry</em>, else it would make little sense. Regardless, Shopistry is building a modular e-commerce service that it thinks is better than other headless e-commerce services. It has pretty big competition in BigCommerce and Shopify, but those companies were also once wee startups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/brainq-raises-40m-to-transform-stroke-patient-rehabilitation-with-its-home-therapy-device/">BrainQ wants to transform stroke rehab:</a> </strong>At-home stroke therapy startup BrainQ has racked up a $40 million round, TechCrunch wrote today. What does its hardware do? It “stimulates the damaged part of the brain and promotes self-repair,” and does so with enough impact that it secured “a Breakthrough Device certification from the FDA.” I mean, that’s super cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/how-one-founder-identified-a-gap-in-education-working-as-a-teacher-and-built-a-startup-to-fix-it/"><strong>How Amanda DoAmaral built Fiveable:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today on the Found podcast, TechCrunch has a real treat: “Hear how DoAmaral took her dissatisfaction with an inadequate system and turned that into the motivation to build a venture-scale business outside of it.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Nuro EC-1</h2>
<p>In 2010, Google&#8217;s autonomous vehicle project placed self-driving cars on Bay Area streets and freeways, but practical applications were thought to be at least a decade away.</p>
<p>The futurists were right on schedule: In 2020, Mountain View-based Nuro was testing its second-generation R2 robotic vehicle, the first to earn a federal exemption to operate an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>By the time Nuro raised $940 million for its Series B, it had already partnered with companies like CVS, Walmart and Domino&#8217;s to use the R2 for last-mile deliveries.</p>
<p>But before Nuro could even consider reaching product-market fit, its founders had to overcome technological challenges, win over regulators and strike partnerships with a range of consumer-facing companies.</p>
<p>“Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” says co-founder Dave Ferguson. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google’s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a></p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro’s self-driving delivery vehicles</a></p>

Frankly, this sounds like a good idea, and one that could improve the app’s overall safety. Our only question is how it took this long for Tinder to get to.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/cisco-beefing-up-app-monitoring-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-epsagon-for-500m/"><strong>Cisco buys Epsagon:</strong></a> U.S. tech company Cisco has plonked down around $500 million for Israeli app monitoring company Epsagon. Sure, Israel is best known for its cybersecurity work, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the country is one-note. The deal didn’t appear to move Cisco’s stock, which eased modestly during a generally lackluster day for technology shares. Still, we don’t see this size of deal as often as we once did, it feels, so we wanted to highlight it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Do you want more privacy breaches? This is how you get more privacy breaches.</a> </strong>That’s my takeaway from news that Pearson is paying a $1 million fine for a 2018 breach that leaked millions of student records, one that it failed to mention to investors. The SEC agreed to the settlement. Next they’ll fine Exxon $47.29 for lying about climate change.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After meeting an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">ignominious end in 2017</a>, the anonymous gossip app once popular with college students lives again. Yik Yak returned to the iOS App Store on Monday (sorry, Android users) under new ownership, inspiring a fresh round of interest in the long-dead social network.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With a reputation for rampant cyber-bullying and harassment, moderation woes were central to the app&#8217;s failure. Once ubiquitous on many college campuses, Yik Yak <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/fading-anonymous-social-network-yik-yak-is-reportedly-laying-off-most-of-its-employees/">limped into 2016</a>, laying off most employees and struggling to keep users engaged. The app tried to pivot away from campus gossip and toward location-based social networking that same year, but it wasn&#8217;t enough and the once high-flying social network was sold for scrap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/embed/#?secret=GVis4hJnsW" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington wound down the app in 2017, Square paid $1 million for several Yik Yak engineers and rights to some of the company&#8217;s intellectual property. The company had raised $73 million and was valued around $400 million in 2014, during its peak. TechCrunch contacted the company for information about its new ownership, which is apparently based in Nashville, but has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Though we&#8217;re still not sure who re-launched it, the new version of Yik Yak is well aware of the original app&#8217;s pitfalls. After providing a phone number to sign up, a short onboarding sequence warns users of a zero tolerance &#8220;one strike and you&#8217;re out&#8221; policy for bullying and threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re committed to combating bullying and hate speech on the Yik Yak platform by any means necessary,&#8221; the new Yik Yak team, which acquired the rights to develop the app in February, <a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back">wrote on a relaunched website</a>.</p>
<p>Being aware of what issues will inevitably arise on a social network and being prepared to moderate those issues at scale are two very different propositions. Yik Yak is anonymous, but it&#8217;s also an app focused on what&#8217;s happening IRL nearby within a tight radius, two factors that could combine to pose even more of a moderation challenge.</p>
<p>Within the new app, a sidebar points users toward &#8220;stay safe&#8221; resources address and array of issues that could arise on the app, like ridesharing, bullying, sexual consent and COVID-19, though the app doesn&#8217;t yet include explicit misinformation policies.</p>
<p>Another section in the sidebar offers a list of mental health resources and encourages users to downvote and report any bullying on the app so it can be reviewed by the Yik Yak team. The company says that yaks with a negative ranking from five or more downvotes will be automatically removed from the app&#8217;s feed, though we&#8217;ve asked the company for more details about its content moderation plans, including if a team at Yik Yak is dedicated to the task.</p>
<p>The new Yik Yak is built around location-based sharing and users can share messages, called &#8220;yaks,&#8221; to anyone within a five-mile radius. If you&#8217;re in a rural area or otherwise quiet zone devoid of yaks, you can amuse yourself with the confessions that show up on a chart of popular national posts.</p>
<p>For now, many high-ranking posts are excited chatter about the app&#8217;s return from former Yik Yak devotees — mostly younger millennials who&#8217;ve since graduated from college. A smattering of popular posts warns that Gen Z-ers too young to have used Yik Yak during its heyday won&#8217;t know what hit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this app now 100% 25-30 year olds?&#8221; one post reads. &#8220;The Zoomers aren&#8217;t ready for the return of the Yak,&#8221; another user wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea’s LG Energy Solution has entered into a six-year agreement with an Australian mining company for cobalt and nickel, securing a stable supply of key minerals to make electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>LG Energy, a subsidiary of LG Chem, will purchase 71,000 dry metric tons of nickel and 7,000 dry metric tons of cobalt from Australian Mines Limited starting from the end of 2024. That’s enough raw material to make batteries for 1.3 million EVs with a driving range of over 310 miles per charge.</p>
<p>“Securing key raw materials and a responsible battery supply chain has become a critical element in gaining a greater control within the industry, as the demand for electric vehicles worldwide heightened in recent years,” LG Energy Solution CEO Jong-hyun Kim said in a statement.</p>
<p>The materials will be sourced from Australian Mines’ $1.5 billion Sconi Project based in Queensland, which is currently under development. The site will use a “dry stacking method” to store filtered tailings, an alternative and more eco-friendly way to manage waste from a mining site. Instead of dumping tailings into local water sources or burying them in underground quarries, dry stacking removes the water from the waste, leaving a sand-like substance that can be securely stored in management facilities.</p>
<p>“Although more costly compared to the conventional method due to construction and maintenance expenses, the dry stacking method is deemed an environmentally friendly way to extract raw materials,” LG Energy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The sole condition to the agreement is that Australian Mines secure financing for the construction of the project before the end of June next year. If secured, the agreement would account for all of the anticipated output of the site.</p>
<p>The two companies have the option to extend the agreement by another five years by mutual agreement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LG Energy is a subsidiary of LG Chem, one of the world’s largest producers of batteries and battery materials. Last month, the company said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/">it had earmarked</a> ₩6 trillion ($5.2 billion) in its battery businesses, specifically the production of anode materials, separation membranes and cathode binders. Earlier this summer, it also entered into an agreement with Queensland Pacific Metals valued at ₩12 billion ($10.3 million), for 7,000 tons of nickel and 700 tons of cobalt per year over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>LG Chem counts Volkswagen, General Motors and Tesla amongst its customers. It said it anticipates the global battery market only expanding in the coming years, from ₩39 trillion ($34 billion) in 2021 to ₩100 trillion ($87 billion) by 2026.</p>
<p>It isn’t the only major player vying to secure sources of raw materials. In a move to obtain its own battery source, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla inked a deal</a> with commodity production giant BHP in July for nickel from its mines in Western Australian.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">T-Mobile has confirmed &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; to its systems, days after a portion of customer data was listed for sale on a known cybercriminal forum.</p>
<p>The U.S. cell giant, which last year completed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-officially-completes-merger-with-sprint-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-ahead-of-schedule/">a $26 billion merger with Sprint</a>, confirmed an intrusion but that it has &#8220;not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved.&#8221; The company said that its investigation will &#8220;take some time,&#8221; and no timeline was given.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Vice reported <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">this weekend</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a possible intrusion after a seller was claiming to be in possession of millions of records. The seller told Vice that they had 100 million records on T-Mobile customers, which included customer account names, phone numbers, the IMEI numbers of phones on the account, and Social Security number and driver&#8217;s license information — details that the company often collects to verify the identities of its customers.</p>
<p>Vice verified a sample of the records from the seller, suggesting the data is in at least partially valid.</p>
<p>The forum post, which TechCrunch has seen, asks for 6 bitcoin, or about $275,000, for a 30 million subset of customers&#8217; data. The data was allegedly obtained from a T-Mobile-run database server that was connected to the internet, according to a screenshot posted <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-steal-data-of-100-million-t-mobile-customers/">by Bleeping Computer</a>, which also reported that the seller has the IMEI database &#8220;going back to 2004.&#8221; IMEI and ISMI numbers can be used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">uniquely identify and locate</a> a cellphone user.</p>
<p>An earlier post seen by TechCrunch from the same seller and using the same sample of data claimed to have 124 million records, but still did not name T-Mobile as the source of the data. The post was deleted in the past few days.</p>
<p>This is by our count the fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years.</p>
<p>In January, T-Mobile said it had a data breach that saw cybercriminals steal about 200,000 call records and other subscriber data. Last year, T-Mobile had two incidents — it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/t-mobile-says-hacker-gained-access-to-employee-email-accounts-user-data/">admitted a breach</a> on its email systems that saw hackers access some T-Mobile employee email accounts and access customer data; and a breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/">a million prepaid customers&#8217;</a> personal and billing information months later. In 2018, T-Mobile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">as many as two million customers</a> may have had their personal information scraped.</p>

			It used to be that if you were a fintech startup or, for lack of a better term, a digitally native financial services business, you might be eyeing an acquisition from an incumbent in the industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But lately, fintech upstarts are the ones doing the acquiring. Over just the last year or so, we’ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>In February 2020, <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">LendingClub</a> announced plans to <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/lendingclub-announces-acquisition-of-radius-bank/">acquire Radius Bank</a> in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $185 million. The deal <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/its-official-today-radius-joined-lendingclub/">closed in February 2021</a>, leading to a very quick and surprising <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lendingclub-stock-jumps-40-after-surprise-q2-profit-11627505448?mod=article_inline">second-quarter profit</a>.</li>
<li>In March of this year, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/sofi-acquires-community-bank-golden-pacific-bancorp-to-speed-up-its-national-bank-charter-process/">agreed to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp (GBP)</a> for about $22.3 million in a deal that was designed to accelerate its acquisition of a national bank charter.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, blockchain-based lender <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure Technologies</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210803005925/en/Figure-Announces-Merger-With-Top-Mortgage-Lender-Homebridge-Financial-Services">agreed to merge</a> with mortgage firm Homebridge Financial Services, which has 180 retail branches and funded more than $25 billion in home loans in 2020.</li>
<li>And last fall, fintech startup and challenger bank Jiko <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/09/04/fintech-startup-jiko-completes-buy-of-nationally-regulated-u-s-bank/">acquired Wadena, Minnesota-based Mid-Central National Bank</a> in a deal that took years of due diligence and whose sales price fell in the range of a Series A round, according to the founder.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on here? Why are fintechs now acquiring legacy financial services businesses, instead of the other way around?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s ambitious upstart decentralized social media working group &#8220;<a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">bluesky</a>&#8221; took an important step Monday as the social media company appointed a formal project lead who will direct how the protocol develops moving forward.</p>
<p>Crypto developer Jay Graber was tapped by Twitter to helm the initiative, which the company hopes will eventually create a decentralized social media protocol that a number of social networks including Twitter will operate on. The separate bluesky organization will operate independently but to date has been funded and managed largely by employees at Twitter.</p>
<p>Graber had already been working in a less formal role inside the bluesky team, with Twitter paying her to create a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem for a working group of developers in the space. Graber previously worked on the developer team behind privacy focused cryptocurrency Zcash and built out her own decentralized social network called <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, designed to compete with Facebook Events. Graber eventually walked away from the effort after having issues bootstrapping a user base interested in the benefits of decentralization, something that has grown to be a near-insurmountable issue for most upstart networks in the space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m excited to announce that I’ll be leading <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>, an initiative started by <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a> to decentralize social media.

<p>&mdash; Jay Graber (@arcalinea) <a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1427314482154414080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In an interview back in January, Graber told TechCrunch she saw a major opportunity in Twitter entering the decentralized social space due to the hefty user base on the Twitter platform, which will itself eventually migrate to the protocol, the company has said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The really powerful thing about Twitter doing a decentralized protocol move is that if you could design a protocol that works in an ideal way, you don&#8217;t have to go through the initial effort of finding the niche to bootstrap from because Twitter will bring so many users,&#8221; Graber told us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In January, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">TechCrunch profiled the initiative</a> as it gathered more attention following Twitter&#8217;s permanent ban of former President Donald Trump from its platform. Following Trump&#8217;s removal, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey highlighted the bluesky effort as one of the company&#8217;s ongoing initiatives to ensure that social media moderation could be less </span>decentralized<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in the future. A decentralized social media protocol would allow for individual networks to govern themselves without one company or organization exercising monolithic control over the sphere of online conversations. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a huge focus for everyone involved has been thinking how do we enable better moderation, and not just coming from one source,&#8221; Graber told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The bluesky organization is still in its earliest stages. Graber&#8217;s next task is bulking up the team with its first hires, which include a protocol developer and web developer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spin users planning trips in 84 cities, towns and campuses across the U.S., Canada, Germany and Spain will be able to view Spin's electric scooters and bikes on the app while planning their trip.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford-owned micromobility company Spin has announced an integration with Google Maps. Now, users planning their trips in 84 cities, towns and campuses across the U.S., Canada, Germany and Spain will be able to view Spin&#8217;s electric scooters and bikes on the app while planning their trip.</p>
<p>Spin joins its top competition on the popular mapping app, Lime, which also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration with transit planning app Moovit</a>. We can expect to see further integrations of micromobility operators with mapping apps as shared mobility becomes part of the broader transit ecosystem.</p>
<p>A recent report from the <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association</a> on the state of the micromobility industry found that 50% of riders reported using shared mobility to connect to transit, and 16% of all micromobility trips were for the purpose of connecting to transit.</p>
<p>Similar to Lime, the Spin icon will now show up under Google Map&#8217;s bike section when planning a journey &#8212; only in the mobile app, not on the desktop. A user will see the nearest available Spin vehicle, how long it will take to walk to it, what the estimated battery range is and the expected arrival time if using the vehicle. Choosing that option will direct users to the Spin app to pay for and unlock the vehicle.</p>
<p>“With this integration, Spin is making it easier for millions of Google Maps users to easily incorporate shared bikes and scooters into their daily trips,” Ben Bear, CEO of Spin, said in a statement. “Our goal is to make it as low friction as possible for consumers to plan multi-modal journeys. It needs to be just as easy, and even more convenient to get around with bikes, buses, trains and scooters as it is with a personal car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear also said this collaboration with Google is Spin&#8217;s largest yet, and he teased &#8220;many more in the pipeline.&#8221; Spin is already integrated into platforms like Citymapper, Moovit, Transit and Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe. This news comes not long after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">Spin announced it would be adding e-bikes to the mix</a> and trying to capture market share with exclusive or semi-exclusive city partnerships. A major app integration such as this one could be a vote of confidence for Spin looking to partner with more cities in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder announced this morning that in the &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">coming quarters</a>,&#8221; users will be able to verify their ID on the app. This feature <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041821872-Age-verify-to-chat-with-matches">was first rolled out in Japan</a> in 2019, where Tinder users must verify that they are at least 18 years old. Aside from places like Japan, where this is mandated by law, ID verification will &#8220;begin as voluntary,&#8221; Tinder wrote in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>ID verification will be free for all users, similar to its <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034941812-What-is-Photo-Verification-">photo verification</a> feature. According to a Tinder spokesperson, the company will also use ID verification to cross-reference data like the sex offender registry in regions where that information is accessible. Tinder already does this via credit card lookup when users sign up for a subscription. Per its <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms/us/en">terms of use</a>, Tinder requires that users &#8220;have never been convicted of or pled no contest to a felony, a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The existing photo verification feature adds a Twitter-like blue check to a user&#8217;s profile, while ID verification will yield another distinct badge. That way, users can tell whether or not a potential date has confirmed their identity via photo verification, ID verification, both or neither.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a truly equitable solution for ID Verification is a challenging, but critical safety project and we are looking to our communities as well as experts to help inform our approach,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>While Tinder has made continued investments in safety features, free ID verification can only go so far &#8212; especially when voluntary, putting the onus on individual users to decide whether or not they feel comfortable meeting up with unverified users. But in March 2021, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Match Group, the parent company to Tinder, announced its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">seven-figure contribution</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to the nonprofit background check company Garbo. </span>Garbo&#8217;s background checks could help detect dating app users with a history of violence or abuse, but we have yet to see how that will be integrated into Tinder, and if users will be charged for access. Notably, Garbo conducts &#8220;equitable background&#8221; checks, meaning that it will exclude <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">drug possession charges and minor traffic incidents</a> on its platform, citing the way that these charges are disproportionately levied against vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though Tinder said it will not be using Garbo&#8217;s tech to power its ID verification tools, the company noted to TechCrunch that it will have more information to share about background checks via Garbo in the fall. Tinder didn&#8217;t share whether or not access to information from Garbo will be paywalled. At the time of the investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">Match Group said</a> it would determine pricing &#8212; if it does choose to paywall this information &#8212; based on factors like user adoption, how many people want to use it and how many searches they want to perform.</span></p>
<p>Tinder&#8217;s investment in safety features is encouraging, but if left behind a paywall, impact may be limited. Match Group faced serious scrutiny in December 2019, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">an investigation</a> by Columbia Journalism Investigations (CJI) and ProPublica found that the company screened for sexual predators on Match, a paid service, but not on free apps like Tinder, OkCupid and PlentyofFish. At the time, a spokesperson for the company said, “There are definitely registered sex offenders on our free products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January 2020, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/subcommittee-chairman-krishnamoorthi-launches-investigation-into-user-safety">launched an investigation</a> into user safety policies on dating apps, sending letters to Match Group, The Meet Group, Bumble and Grindr. He wrote, &#8220;Protection from sexual predators should not be a luxury confined to paying customers.” The following month, U.S. Representatives Ann Kuster (D-NH) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) wrote a <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements">letter to Match Group</a>, signed by nine other representatives, stating their concern that Match Group doesn&#8217;t cross-reference user responses with sex offender registries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around the same time, Match Group made several moves to invest more deeply in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-02-25-The-Top-10-Safety-Focused-Features-on-Tinder">user safety</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; for example, it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">acquired Noonlight</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in January 2020, which allows users in the U.S. to share who, when and where they&#8217;re meeting someone. In dangerous situations, users can discreetly trigger emergency services &#8212; Noonlight will first reach out to the user, then call 911 if necessary (Noonlight&#8217;s basic version is free, but some features like connecting to an Apple Watch, Google Home or Alexa are only available by upgrading to a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://help.noonlight.com/en/articles/3270559-how-much-does-noonlight-cost">$5 or $10 monthly plan</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">). Features like these can be controversial due to concerns about police intervention, but might help some users feel a sense of security. But blocking offenders prior to signup could lessen the need for such intervention in the first place.</span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past decade has seen several structural changes in know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations in Europe and globally. High-profile money laundering cases and the penetration of illicit funds into global markets have caught the attention of regulators and the public, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>The Wirecard scandal was a particularly salacious example, in which the investigation into widespread fraud <a href="https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/07/wirecard-a-scandal/">revealed a chain of shell companies involved in illegal distribution of narcotics and pornography</a>. Over at Danske Bank, some <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/aml/how-danske-is-cleaning-up-after-a-200b-money-laundering-scandal/29595.article">$227 billion was laundered through an Estonian subsidiary</a>, going virtually unnoticed for nine years.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338">against Ripple Labs and two of its executives</a>, claiming they had raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. That case is ongoing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As regulators and financial institutions improve their understanding of these criminal practices, AML requirements have likewise been improved. But these adjustments have been an overwhelmingly reactive, trial-by-fire process.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of the fast-evolving blockchain ecosystem, the European Union has begun to introduce more stringent financial regulations that further bolster the regulatory system in order to improve licensing models. Many member states now regulate crypto assets individually, and Germany is leading the way in being the first to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These individual regulations clearly prescribe the pathway for crypto companies, outlining the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a financial license from the regulator. Compliance naturally boosts investor confidence and protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As these financial crimes and crypto itself evolves, so have regulatory bodies’ efforts to monitor, address and enforce restrictions. Internationally, the most prominent monitoring body is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which outlines general guidance and determines best practices in anti-money-laundering practices and combating the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>Although FATF is considered soft law, the task force sets the bar for workable regulations within crypto assets. Especially notable is FATF’s Recommendation 16, better known as the “travel rule,” which requires businesses to collect and store the personal data of participants in blockchain transactions. In theory, access to this data will enable authorities to have better oversight and enforcement of crypto market regulations. In other words, they’ll know exactly who is doing exactly what. Transparency is key.</p>
<h2>The travel rule conundrum</h2>
<p>FATF’s travel rule impacts two types of businesses: traditional financial institutions (banks, credit firms and so on) and crypto companies, otherwise known as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/latest-fatf-rules-jolt-crypto-businesses-what-are-the-new-realities-crypto-has-to-acknowledge-to-stay-afloat/">virtual asset service providers</a> (VASPs).</p>
<p>In its original incarnation, the travel rule only applied to banks, but was expanded to crypto companies in 2019. In 2021, many of the FATF member jurisdictions began to incorporate the travel rule into their local AML laws. This regulatory shift sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. The stakes of refusal are high: Failure to incorporate the travel rule results in a service provider being declared noncompliant, which is a major obstacle to doing business.</p>
<p>But, the travel rule is also a major hindrance that doesn’t take into account the novelty of crypto technology. It is problematic for crypto businesses to integrate due to the major amount of effort it poses when obtaining KYC data about the recipient and integrating it into day-to-day business.</p>
<p>In order for crypto businesses to obtain this information for outgoing payments, data would have to be provided by the client and would end up being virtually impossible to verify. This is highly disruptive to the crypto’s emblematic efficiency. Moreover, its implementation presents challenges regarding the accuracy of the data received by VASPs and banks. Also, it creates further data vulnerabilities due to additional data silos being created across the globe.</p>
<p>When it comes to international standardization measures rather than those isolated within certain communities, there is a wide gap between exclusively on-chain solutions (transactions that are recorded and verified on one specific blockchain) and cross-chain communication, which allows for interactions between different blockchains or for combining on-chain transactions with off-chain transactions that are conducted on other electronic systems, such as PayPal.</p>
<p>We must eventually find a halfway point between those with valid concerns about the anonymity crypto assets provide and those who see regulation as prohibitively restrictive on crypto. Both sides have a point, but crypto’s continued legitimacy and viability within the larger financial markets and industry is a net positive for all parties, making this negotiation nothing short of crucial.</p>
<h2>Not anti-regulation, just anti-unworkable regulations</h2>
<p>Ultimately, we need to regulate with efficacy, which necessitates legislation that is applicable specifically to digital assets and does not hinder the market without really solving any AML-related problems.</p>
<p>The already global nature of the traditional financial industry underscores the value of and need for FATF’s issuance of an international framework for regulatory oversight within crypto.</p>
<p>The criminal financial trade &#8212; money laundering, illegal weapons sales, human trafficking and so on &#8212; is also an international business. Thus, cracking down on it is, out of necessity, an international effort.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain, which runs contrary to the central-server standard we know and use nearly everywhere, presents a formidable challenge here. Rules and regulations for traditional financial institutions are being implemented part and parcel onto crypto — a misstep and misunderstanding that ignores the innovation and novelty this economic ecosystem and its underlying technology entails.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology. However well intentioned they may be, because these imposed regulations are built on an old system, they must be adapted and modified.</p>
<p>The creation of fair restrictions on the technology’s use requires a fundamental understanding and cooperation within the limits and characteristics of those technologies. In traditional financial circles, the topic of blockchain is currently subject to more impassioned rhetoric than genuine understanding.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is the fundamental misunderstanding that blockchain transactions are anonymous or untraceable. Blockchain transactions are pseudo-anonymous and, in most circumstances, can offer more traceability and transparency than traditional banking. Illegal activity conducted on the blockchain will always be far more traceable than cash transactions, for example.</p>
<p>Technology with such immense potential should be made accessible, regulated and beneficial for everyone. Blockchain and digital assets are already revolutionizing the way we operate, and regulatory measures need to follow suit. The way forward cannot simply be delivering old-school directives, demanding obedience and doling out unfair punishments. There’s no reason a new way forward isn’t possible.</p>
<h2>The end of the outlaw era</h2>
<p>Activity can already be monitored through a collective database of users known to abide by international standards. This knowledge of approved users and vendors allows the industry to spot misconduct or malfeasance far sooner than usual, singling out and restricting illegitimate users.</p>
<p>By means of a well-thought-through tweaking of the suggested regulations, a verified network can collectively be built to ensure trust and properly leverage blockchain’s potential, while barring those bad actors intent on corrupting or manipulating the system. That would be a huge step forward in prosecuting international financial crimes and ensuring crypto’s legitimacy globally.</p>
<p>Crypto’s outlaw days are over, but it’s gained an unprecedented level of legitimacy that can only be preserved and bolstered by abiding with regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>That regulatory oversight can’t just be the old way of doing things copy-and-pasted onto blockchain transactions. Instead, it needs to be one that helps fight criminal activity, shores up investor confidence and throws a bone &#8212; not a wrench &#8212; to the very mechanics that make crypto a desirable financial investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pearson/">Pearson</a>, a London-based publishing and education giant that provides software to schools and universities has agreed to pay $1 million to settle charges that it misled investors about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/education-software-maker-pearson-says-data-breach-affected-thousands-of-accounts-in-the-u-s/">a 2018 data breach resulting in the theft of millions of student records</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-154">settlement</a> on Monday after the agency found that Pearson made “misleading statements and omissions” about its 2018 data breach, which saw millions of student usernames and scrambled passwords stolen, along with the administrator login credentials of 13,000 schools, district and university customer accounts.</p>
<p>The agency said that in Person&#8217;s semi-annual review filed in July 2019, the company referred to the incident as a “hypothetical risk,” even after the data breach had happened. Similarly, <a href="https://www.pearson.com/news-and-research/announcements/2019/07/pearson-customer-notification.html">in a statement that same month</a>, Pearson said the breach may include dates of birth and email addresses, when it knew that such records were stolen, according to the SEC.</p>
<p>Pearson also said that it had &#8220;strict protections&#8221; in place when it actually took the company six months to patch the vulnerability after it was notified.</p>
<p>“As the order finds, Pearson opted not to disclose this breach to investors until it was contacted by the media, and even then Pearson understated the nature and scope of the incident, and overstated the company’s data protections,” said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit. “As public companies face the growing threat of cyber intrusions, they must provide accurate information to investors about material cyber incidents.”</p>
<p>While Pearson did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, Pearson agreed to pay a $1 million penalty — a small fraction of the $489 million in pre-tax profits that the company raked in last year.</p>
<p>A Pearson spokesperson told TechCrunch: “We&#8217;re pleased to resolve this matter with the SEC. We also appreciate the work of the FBI and the Justice Department to identify and charge those responsible for a global cyberattack that affected Pearson and many other companies and industries, including at least one government agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pearson said the breach related to its AIMSweb1.0 web-based software for entering and tracking students’ academic performance, which it retired in July 2019. &#8220;Pearson continues to enhance its cybersecurity efforts to minimize the risk of cyberattacks in an ever-changing threat landscape,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox is using M&amp;A to bulk up its social infrastructure, announcing Monday morning that they had acquired the team at <a href="https://www.guilded.gg/">Guilded</a> that has been building a chat platform for competitive gamers.</p>
<p>The service competes with gaming chat giant Discord, with the team&#8217;s founders telling TechCrunch in the past that as Discord&#8217;s ambitions had grown beyond the gaming world, its core product was meeting fewer competitive gaming needs. Like Discord, users can have text and voice conversations on the Guilded platform, but Guilded also allowed users to organize communities around events and calendars, with plenty of specific functionality designed around ensuring that tournaments happened seamlessly.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s product supported hundreds of games, with specific functionality for a handful of titles, including League of Legends, Fortnite, CS: GO and, yes, Roblox. Earlier this year, the company launched a bot API designed to help nontechnical users build bots that could enrich their gaming communities.</p>
<p>Guilded had raised $10.2 million in venture capital funding to date according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guilded/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/guilded-raises-7-million-for-its-competitive-gaming-focused-chat-app/">$7 million Series A</a> led by Matrix Partners early last year. The company launched out of Y Combinator in mid-2017.</p>

<p>Terms of the Roblox deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. In an announcement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005389/en/Roblox-Acquires-Guilded-a-Platform-to-Connect-Gaming-Communities">post</a>, Roblox detailed that the Guilded team will operate as an independent product group going forward. In a<a href="https://www.guilded.gg/blog/joining-roblox"> separate blog post</a>, Guilded CEO Eli Brown wrote that existing stakeholders will be able to continue using the product as they have previously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone &#8211; including communities, partners, and bot developers &#8211; will be able to keep using Guilded the same way you are now,&#8221; Brown wrote. &#8220;Roblox believes in our team and in our mission, and we&#8217;re going to continue to operate as an independent product in order to achieve it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roblox has seen profound success and heightened investor attention in recent years as the pandemic has pushed more gamers online and brought more users into the fold, but that success has drawn the attention of competitors. In June, Facebook acquired a small Roblox competitor called Crayta, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing just weeks ago that he planned to transform Facebook into a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; company, using a term many have come to associate closely with what Roblox has been building. Guilded represents an opportunity for Roblox to bring its user base deeper inside its own suite of products, creating a social infrastructure that keeps users engaged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin, the space company helmed by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is taking NASA to court. The company filed a complaint with a federal claims court on Monday over the agency’s decision to award a lunar lander contract solely to rival company SpaceX.</p>
<p>The complaint, which Blue Origin successfully petitioned to have sealed, says NASA&#8217;s evaluation of proposals for the the Human Landing System was &#8220;unlawful and improper.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Blue Origin filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the moon for America.”</p>
<p>The Human Landing System, a key part of NASA’s forthcoming Artemis program, is the lander that will return humans to the moon’s surface for the first time since the days of Apollo. NASA aims to have the human lander touching down at the lunar south pole in 2024.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">NASA awarded the HLS contract</a> to a single company — SpaceX, which submitted a $2.9 billion bid. That NASA selected only one company, rather than two, was a surprise (the agency likes to hedge its bets). Only a few weeks later, Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics, which also submitted a bid for the lander program, filed separate protests with the Government Accountability Office over the decision. GAO later upheld NASA’s decision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/government-watchdog-rejects-blue-origins-protest-over-lunar-lander-contract/">maintaining that</a> “the [contract] announcement reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”</p>
<p>(Read a blow-by-blow of GAO’s rationale by TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">here</a>).</p>
<p>When GAO released its decision, it seemed like that might have been case closed: SpaceX won, Blue Origin lost. This new lawsuit, filed to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, is a clear signal that Jeff Bezos’ company has no intention of backing down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For its part, a NASA spokesperson would say little more to TechCrunch than that the agency was notified of the complaint and &#8220;officials are currently reviewing details of the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a federal court filing represents Blue Origin’s buttoned-up protests, the company has also been waging a separate attack on social media, releasing a series of infographics aimed at discrediting SpaceX’s Starship and NASA’s decision to use it for moon missions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190043" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190043" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1325" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg 1275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=768,994 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=525,680 525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=1187,1536 1187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.blueorigin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Origin <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>On one infographic, referring to Starship, the words “IMMENSELY COMPLEX &amp; HIGH RISK” blaze across the image in red; another described it as “a launch vehicle that has never flown to orbit and is still being designed.”</p>
<p>The case number is 1:21-cv-01695-RAH. TechCrunch has reached out to NASA for comment and will update the story if they respond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic was a catalyst for showing companies looking to cut costs, just how much they were spending on their software tools.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic was a catalyst for showing companies looking to cut costs just how much they were spending on their software tools. New York-based <a href="https://tropicapp.io/">Tropic</a>’s platform not only uncovers those savings, but also brings a click-and-approve approach to buying software. Today, the company announced a $25 million Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>Canaan Partners led the round, with participation from Founder Collective and Mo Koyfman’s new fund, Shine. It gives Tropic $27.1 million in total funding since the company emerged from stealth in 2020, CEO David Campbell told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Prior to founding the company with Justin Etkin, Campbell was in technology and sales roles, selling software contracts of every size, and realized how complex and rigid the contracts were getting as companies grew larger and the lack of price transparency increased. The complexity of some contracts can cause companies to overpay, even locking companies into payments they can’t afford, Campbell said.</p>
<p>On top of that, more buyers are younger now and their experience with purchasing software is pulling out their phone to download an app, while buying a customer relationship management tool will take six months to buy and cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“Looking at the space, we are in a mirror maze of software, including companies using software to build products that they then sell back to the software companies,” Campbell said. “Companies are only buying software once a year, yet the process can be so complex.”</p>
<p>Tropic’s SaaS procurement model gathers the whole process under one platform. Unlike some competitors’ approaches, it takes on the heavy lifting so when companies have to buy or renew a contract, users can access Tropic’s one-click purchasing service to outsource the transaction. After the contracts are signed, its platform manages the technology and ensures financing is in order. This approach saves companies 23%, on average, on the software purchases, which Campbell said “moves the needle” for many companies where software is the No. 1 cost after salary.</p>
<p>In recent years, cloud software has become a fast-growing spend category across most businesses. Campbell said the average company can have more than 100 software contracts, while that jumps to over 500 for enterprise organizations. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/203428/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast/">global spend on enterprise software</a> is forecasted to reach $599 billion by the end of 2021, a 13.2% increase over the previous year, according to Statista.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the last 12 months, the company added over 60 customers, counting Qualtrics, Vimeo, Zapier and Intercom, surpassed $250 million in managed spend and processed transactions for over 1,200 vendors. The company is seeing 100% quarter over quarter growth, and in the last quarter, doubled its annual recurring revenue, Campbell said.</p>
<p>Tropic will use the funding for R &amp; D and to deepen integrations with existing procurement tools in the cloud software ecosystem. Over the past year, the company’s headcount has grown to 50 and Campbell has “aggressive hiring plans between now and the rest of the year” focused on the tech side with engineering and product management.</p>
<p>Hootan Rashidifard, principal from Canaan Partners, said his firm was tracking the software procurement sector and learned about Tropic through Founder Collective, which led the company’s seed round.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing software and financial services converge and Tropic sits squarely at the intersection of both in a category with massive tailwinds,” Rashidifard said via email. “Software is accelerating the share of expenses while also penetrating every part of an organization, and software purchasing is becoming more decentralized. Tropic’s platform is in a fragmented market with high payment volume, which is ripe for layering on all kinds of adjacent services.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Six years ago, I sat in the Google self-driving project's Firefly vehicle — which I described, at the time, as a "little gumdrop on wheels" — and let it ferry me around a course in Mountain View.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years ago, I sat in the Google self-driving project&#8217;s Firefly vehicle — which I described, at the time, as a &#8220;little gumdrop on wheels&#8221; — and let it ferry me around a closed course in Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>Little did I know that two of the people behind Firefly&#8217;s ability to see and perceive the world around it and react to that information would soon leave to start and steer an autonomous vehicle company of their very own.</p>
<p>Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu aren&#8217;t the only Google self-driving project employees to launch an AV startup, but they might be the most underrated. Their company, <strong>Nuro</strong>, is valued at $5 billion and has high-profile partnerships with leaders in retail, logistics and food including FedEx, Domino&#8217;s and Walmart. And, they seem to have navigated the regulatory obstacle course with success — at least so far.</p>
<p>Yet, Nuro has remained largely in the shadows of other autonomous vehicle companies. Perhaps it&#8217;s because Nuro&#8217;s focus on autonomous delivery hasn&#8217;t captured the imagination of a general public that envisions themselves being whisked away in a robotaxi. Or it might be that they&#8217;re quieter.</p>
<p>Those quiet days might be coming to an end soon.</p>
<p>This series aims to look under Nuro&#8217;s hood, so to speak, from its earliest days as a startup to where it might be headed next — and with whom.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <strong>Mark Harris</strong>, a freelance reporter known for investigative and long-form articles on science and technology. Our resident scoop machine, Harris is based in Seattle and also writes for Wired, The Guardian, The Economist, MIT Technology Review and Scientific American. He has broken stories about self-driving vehicles, giant airships, AI body scanners, faulty defibrillators and monkey-powered robots. In 2014, he was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT, and in 2015 he won the AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Gold Award.</p>
<p>The lead editor of this EC-1 was <strong>Kirsten Korosec</strong>, transportation editor at TechCrunch (that&#8217;s me), who has been writing about autonomous vehicles and the people behind them since 2014; OK maybe earlier. The assistant editor for this series was <strong>Ram Iyer</strong>, the copy editor was<strong> Richard Dal Porto</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <strong>Nigel Sussman</strong>. The EC-1 series editor is <strong>Danny Crichton</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Nuro had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Harris nor Korosec have any financial ties to Nuro.</em></p>
<p>The Nuro EC-1 comprises four articles numbering 10,600 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Here are the topics we&#8217;ll be dialing into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google&#8217;s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a>&#8221; (3,200 words/13 minutes) — explores the early days of Nuro and its founders and how they realized that the most useful robot they could ever build would be an autonomous delivery vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Regulations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro&#8217;s self-driving delivery vehicles</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — analyzes how Nuro won over federal regulators and navigated a patchwork of policies to be able to test and deploy its autonomous delivery vehicles in several states.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Partnerships</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-partnerships/">How Nuro became the robotic face of Domino&#8217;s</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — digs into Nuro&#8217;s relationship with Domino&#8217;s as well its trials with other companies including fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle, Kroger grocery stores and CVS pharmacies and how those relationships have affected the design and functions of the R2 bot.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Operations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">Here&#8217;s what the inevitable friendly neighborhood robot invasion looks like</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — examines where Nuro has set up shop, and more importantly, how it goes about picking locations and learning from its experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re always iterating on the EC-1 format. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please send an email to TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton at <a href="mailto:danny@techcrunch.com">danny@techcrunch.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro doesn&#8217;t have a typical Silicon Valley origin story. It didn&#8217;t emerge after a long, slow slog from a suburban garage or through a flash of insight in a university laboratory. Nor was it founded at the behest of an eccentric billionaire with money to burn.</p>
<p>Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2016, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were teammates on Google&#8217;s self-driving car effort. Ferguson was directing the project&#8217;s computer vision, machine learning and behavior prediction teams, while Zhu (widely JZ) was in charge of the car&#8217;s perception technologies and cutting-edge simulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both were leading pretty large teams and were responsible for a pretty large portion of the Google car&#8217;s software system,&#8221; Zhu recalls.</p>
<p>As Google prepared to spin out its autonomous car tech into the company that would become Waymo, it first needed to settle a bonus program devised in the earliest days of its so-called Chauffeur project. Under the scheme, early team members could choose staggered payouts over a period of eight years — or leave Google and get a lump sum all at once.</p>
<p>Ferguson and Zhu would not confirm the amount they received, but court filings released as part of Waymo&#8217;s trade secrets case against Uber suggest they each received payouts in the neighborhood of $40 million by choosing to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we were fortunate enough to receive as part of the self-driving car project enabled us to take riskier opportunities, to go and try to build something that had a significant chance of not working out at all,&#8221; Ferguson says.</p>
<p>Within weeks of their departure, the two had incorporated Nuro Inc, a company with the non-ironic mission to &#8220;better everyday life through robotics.&#8221; Its first product aimed to take a unique approach to self-driving cars: Road vehicles with all of the technical sophistication and software smarts of Google&#8217;s robotaxis, but none of the passengers.</p>
<p>In the five years since, Nuro&#8217;s home delivery robots have proven themselves smart, safe and nimble, outpacing Google&#8217;s vehicles to secure the first commercial deployment permit for autonomous vehicles in California, as well as groundbreaking concessions from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>While robotaxi companies struggle with technical hitches and regulatory red tape, Nuro has already made thousands of robotic pizza and grocery deliveries across the U.S., and Ferguson (as president) and Zhu (as CEO) are now heading a company that as of its last funding round in November 2020 valued it at $5 billion with more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>But how did they get there so fast, and where are they headed next?</p>
<h2>Turning money into robots</h2>
<p>&#8220;Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,&#8221; Ferguson says. &#8220;It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nuro's autonomous vehicles (AVs) don't have a human driver on board. There's no room in the narrow chassis for a driver's seat, no need for a steering wheel, accelerator or brake pedals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro&#8217;s delivery autonomous vehicles (AVs) don&#8217;t have a human driver on board. The company&#8217;s founders Dave Ferguson (president) and Jiajun Zhu&#8217;s (CEO) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">vision of a driverless delivery vehicle</a> sought to do away with a lot of the stuff that is essential for a normal car to have, like doors and airbags and even a steering wheel. They built an AV that spared no room in the narrow chassis for a driver&#8217;s seat, and had no need for an accelerator, windshield or brake pedals.</p>
<p>So when the company <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/NHTSA-2019-0017-0001">petitioned the U.S. government</a> in 2018 for a minor exemption from rules requiring a rearview mirror, backup camera and a windshield, Nuro might have assumed the process wouldn&#8217;t be very arduous.</p>
<p>They were wrong.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aamva.org/AAMVA-Comments-on-Nuro-AV-Exemption-Petition/">2019 letter</a> to the U.S. Department of Transportation, The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) &#8220;[wondered] about the description of pedestrian &#8216;crumple zones,&#8217; and whether this may impact the vehicle&#8217;s crash-worthiness in the event of a vehicle-to-vehicle crash. Even in the absence of passengers, AAMVA has concerns about cargo ejection from the vehicle and how Nuro envisions protections from loose loads affecting the driving public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Society of Professional Engineers similarly complained that Nuro&#8217;s request lacked information about the detection of moving objects. &#8220;How would the R2X function if a small child darts onto the road from the passenger side of the vehicle as a school bus is approaching from the driver&#8217;s side?&#8221; it asked. It also recommended the petition be denied until Nuro could provide a more detailed cybersecurity plan against its bots being hacked or hijacked. (Nuro refers to the bots as. R2, but in some written documents reviewed by TechCrunch, the term R2X is used)</p>
<p>The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (now the Alliance Automotive Innovation), which represents most U.S. carmakers, wrote that the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) should not use Nuro&#8217;s kind of petition to &#8220;introduce new safety requirements for [AVs] that have not gone through the rigorous rule-making process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you can see is that many comments came from entrenched interests,&#8221; said David Estrada, Nuro&#8217;s chief legal and policy officer. &#8220;And that&#8217;s understandable. There are multibillion dollar industries that can be disrupted if autonomous vehicles become successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be fair, critical comments also came from nonprofit organizations genuinely concerned about unleashing robots on city streets. The Center for Auto Safety, an independent consumer group, thought that Nuro did not provide enough information on its development and testing, nor any meaningful comparison with the safety of similar, human-driven vehicles. &#8220;Indeed, the planned reliance on &#8216;early on-road tests … with human-manned professional safety drivers&#8217; suggests that Nuro has limited confidence in R2X&#8217;s safe operation,&#8221; it wrote.</p>

<p>Despite such concerns, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/nuro_grant_notice_final-unofficial.pdf">granted</a> Nuro the exemptions it sought in February last year. Up to 5,000 R2 vehicles could be produced for a limited period of two years and subject to Nuro reporting any incidents, without a windshield, rearview mirror or backup camera. Although only a small concession, it was the first — and so far, only — time the U.S. government had relaxed vehicle safety requirements for an AV.</p>
<p>Now Estrada and Nuro hope to use that momentum to chip away at a mountain of regulations that never envisaged vehicles controlled by on-board robots or distant humans, extending from the foothills of local and state government to the peaks of federal and international safety rules.</p>
<p>If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.</p>
<h2>Regulate for success</h2>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of the credible, big AV players want this to be a free-for-all,&#8221; said Dave Ferguson, Nuro&#8217;s co-founder and president. &#8220;We need the confidence of a clear regulatory framework to invest the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars necessary to manufacture vehicles at scale. Otherwise, it&#8217;s really going to limit our ability to deploy.&#8221;</p>
