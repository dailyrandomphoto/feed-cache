</div><p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the board&#8217;s role in an early-stage startup?</p>
<p>Startup founders frequently ask me about the role of a board of directors. A board can be a crucial asset in an early-stage startup.</p>
<p>Here’s a framework for how it can help drive success at your company: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance, or “SPIFS.”</p>
<h2>What is a board of directors, anyway?</h2>
<p>The board of directors helps with governance of the company. U.S. law requires that any company have one, though does not require how big it should be. By generic definition, the board of directors consists of elected individuals that represent shareholders. It is the governing body that provides company oversight and helps set business policy and strategy.</p>
<p>On a more practical level and in a startup environment, the board can aid in creating a successful business strategy, putting together the right management team, developing branding, building good financial habits, and avoiding legal and compliance issues. The needs and composition of the board will change depending on the startup’s stage, management and financing history (e.g., if there are preferred shareholders, investors that require a board seat and more).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors often ask founders about their board for two reasons. First, it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged. The founder can typically choose who is on their board (through careful selection of investors and advisers) and negotiate a board structure they prefer.</p>
<p>Typically, a healthy board will have a good balance between common shareholders, preferred shareholders and <a href="https://tylerjewell.substack.com/p/independent-board-member-guide">independents</a>. It also helps investors and analysts understand who will ask critical questions and give important advice to the company’s executive management, especially when the going gets tough (it inevitably does!).</p>
<h2>What exactly can a board help you do?</h2>
<p>After 20 years as a venture capitalist and board member, I boiled down the value of a board into five main pieces under the acronym SPIFS: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Setting business strategy is one of the main ways that the board helps founders, especially if it’s their first time running a business. It is a valuable sounding board for validating that you have taken a sober account of the market and have the right plan to develop your product and acquire customers.</p>
<p>The board should ask these questions when guiding founders through setting strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I win?</li>
<li>What problem am I solving?</li>
<li>Why is my product the best to solve that problem?</li>
<li>How do I differentiate against my competitors?</li>
<li>Do I have the right go-to-market strategy?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based CRM company <a href="http://hubspot.com">HubSpot</a> announced today that co-founder and CEO Brian Halligan would be stepping into the executive chairman role and CMO Yamini Rangan would be taking over as CEO next month on September 7th.</p>
<p>Rangan joined the company in January 2020 after stints at Dropbox, Workday and SAP. Her strong background in engineering, sales and marketing should prove helpful as she takes over the chief executive role. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspots-ceo-brian-halligan-injured-in-accident-expected-to-make-a-full-and-complete-recovery">Halligan suffered a snowmobile accident</a> earlier this year, and while he has recovered now, Rangan ran the company in his absence, perhaps helping lay the ground work for this decision  Halligan wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@HubSpot/writing-hubspots-next-chapter-940aab669c5d">in a blog post</a> announcing his decision that she is completely prepared to take on this role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yamini has been overseeing day to day operations at HubSpot since March, managing Board meetings, the HubSpot earnings call, and key hiring and growth initiatives, working closely with Dharmesh and the rest of the leadership team. She’s made HubSpot better by being here, and I know that trend will continue with her as CEO.,&#8221; Halligan wrote.</p>

<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, who has been following the company since early days, says he isn&#8217;t surprised to see a change like this. &#8220;With the company recently hitting its 15-year anniversary it really isn&#8217;t a huge surprise that something like this is happening. And given all the success they&#8217;ve had in growing the company to this point, you have to believe they&#8217;ve been preparing for this move for quite some time,&#8221; Leary told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement came as the company released its Q22021 revenue, which looked to be pretty solid coming in at $310.8 million up 53% over the same period last year. The vast majority, over $300 million was subscription revenue with the remainder coming from professional services, a ratio that you would expect for a company like this. The revenue puts them on a nice run rate of over $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The company was founded in Boston in 2006 by Halligan and Dharmesh Shah and raised over $100 million, according to Crunchbase data. It was an early promoter of content marketing, using quality content, often in the form of company blogs, to drive website traffic and increase sales. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s widely accepted now, but when they started the company it was not well known and they helped bring the concept to the mainstream.</p>
<p>HubSpot later moved into a broader CRM platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/09/hubspot-spikes-20-over-its-ipo-price-in-strong-debut/">after going public in 2014</a>. Along with Wayfair, HubSpot is one of the big success stories <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/wayfair-and-hubspot-ipos-could-be-just-the-beginning-for-boston-startup-scene/">to come out of the Boston startup scene</a> and go public, helping to fuel the city&#8217;s startup ecosystem with the money the founders made on their successful IPOs. HubSpot stock was up over 2% in after market trading on the news, perhaps signaling that investors are pleased with the company&#8217;s transition plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">may have shut down</a> its Stories features known as Fleets, but the Stories format will continue to invade other social platforms. TikTok today confirmed it&#8217;s piloting a new feature, TikTok Stories, which will allow it to explore additional ways for its community to bring their creative ideas to life.</p>
<p>The company notes the new feature will be another option, in addition to its existing storytelling tools like videos, Duets, Stitch and LIVE &#8212; it&#8217;s not meant to replace them.</p>
<p>TikTok didn&#8217;t say how long the pilot test would run or whether it would result in a public launch. However, we understand the test has been running for several days, not weeks or months. It is available in a small handful of non-U.S. markets for the time being, with the goal of gaining insight and feedback from TikTok users.</p>

<p>The current set of features may or may not make it to the public product, we should warn.</p>

<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422978668771647491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The feature was discovered by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422978668771647491">Matt Navarra</a>, who is often among the first to find new features in social apps. In this case, he tells us that several tipsters brought screenshots of TikTok Stories to him, but it was initially unclear whether or not it was a hoax.</p>
<p>The timing, of course, was somewhat suspect &#8212; Twitter had just shut down Fleets in what was a fairly high-profile example of a failure to make Stories work on a social platform, despite their popularity on other popular apps, like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and even, as of late, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Pinterest</a>.</p>
<p>From the screenshots and videos of TikTok Stories in action, we see a product that appears to be, for the most part, something that looks familiar to users of Stories on other platforms.</p>
<p>Users can tap a camera button from the new navigation bar on the left side of the screen to create their first Story, then use common tools like those to add text or stickers, insert sounds and even use effects on their content. Like other platforms, users can either record videos or upload photos &#8212; the latter which opens up TikTok to take advantage of users&#8217; larger camera rolls, rather than relying only on video.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Where TikTok&#8217;s version of Stories differentiates itself is that it allows users to comment publicly on the creator&#8217;s content. These comments are public, the app explains, as mutual friends can see each other&#8217;s comments. There is also another tab where you can see how many people viewed a given Story, and whether or not you&#8217;re following those users. A button will allow you to click to follow people back, if you choose.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s Stories are also ephemeral and disappear in 24 hours, the app&#8217;s tutorial explains.</p>
<p>To view Stories from other creators, you can scroll through the new sidebar and tap on the creator&#8217;s avatar to watch their content. (This almost looks like a vertical version of Twitter&#8217;s Fleets bar, even down to the blue rings around creators&#8217; profile photos.)</p>
<p>The addition of Stories offers TikTok users who don&#8217;t post with regularity (or at all) an easier way to start engaging with TikTok&#8217;s tools by getting started with a more comfortable and familiar format. It can also provide creators with a way to interact casually with fans in between their more polished and edited TikTok video posts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="w9yUQUCIqf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=w9yUQUCIqf" data-secret="w9yUQUCIqf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But it also gives TikTok a much larger surface where it could eventually run advertisements, assuming it can first properly moderate the inevitable attempts at skirting its community guidelines that result from launching an &#8220;ephemeral&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>The feature is also a direct shot across Instagram&#8217;s bow, following the Facebook-owned app&#8217;s direct attempt to copy TikTok with Reels.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to say which markets, specifically, can try out TikTok Stories. Screenshots show the feature described in English and on Android phones, however.</p>
<p>Though Stories may have failed on Twitter, the platform isn&#8217;t known for being a home for rich, creative tools, like TikTok. Meanwhile, TikTok believes in exploring any creative tool that could allow its users to express themselves &#8212; whether that&#8217;s through video, livestreaming, interacting with others or now, through ephemeral, short-form content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell U.S. ride-hailing giant Uber reported its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210804005979/en/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021">second-quarter financial results</a>. The company’s numbers come a day after its domestic rival, Lyft,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/"> shared its own Q2 earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Notably while Lyft managed to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, Uber did not. However, Uber did generate positive net income of $1.14 billion in the quarter thanks to its investments in other companies like Didi and Aurora Innovation.</p>
<p>From the top, Uber’s gross bookings totaled $21.9 billion in the second quarter, up 114% compared to the year-ago period. That gross platform spend resulted in $3.93 billion in revenues at Uber, up 105% from the company’s $1.91 billion Q2 2020 results.</p>
<p>Its Q2 performance was enough to keep Uber on track toward its pre-tax profitability goal, with the company reiterating that it will reach adjusted EBITDA profitability by the fourth quarter, per its earnings release.</p>

<p>Analysts had expected the company to post revenues of $3.74 billion, and earnings per share of -$0.51, per data <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBER/analysis?p=UBER">collected by Yahoo Finance</a>. While beating expectations on revenue, the company did not have the same success with its forecasts on its adjusted EBITDA loss. Analysts had expected a narrower adjusted EBITDA loss of -$324.5 million. The adjusted EBITDA reality was a loss of $509 million.</p>
<p>Shares of Uber fell more than 8% in after-hours trading. Shares have since recovered, but are still off by more than 6%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Digging into the company’s individual business operations, in gross bookings terms, Uber’s ride business posted the largest growth in Q2 2021, growing 184% from its year-ago result to $8.84 billion. Delivery, a larger chunk of gross bookings at the company, grew 85% in Q2 2021 to $12.91 billion compared to its year-ago comparable.</p>
<p>Uber derives less revenue per dollar of delivery gross bookings than it does in ride-hailing, with its two businesses generating $1.96 billion and $1.62 billion in revenues, respectively, despite their massive differential in total consumer spend.</p>
<p>Freight, Uber’s smallest named division in revenue terms, grew 64%, to $348 million. Despite its small size, Uber has been expanding the division and making strategic acquisitions and partnerships as a means to help the segment break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Last month, Uber Freight acquired Transplace from private equity group TPG Capital for about $2.25 billion. The deal involved $750 million in Uber stock, with the remainder in cash.</p>

<p>Uber’s two key businesses were not profitable in aggregate, with the company’s ride-hailing and delivery businesses not managing to save the company from negative adjusted profits. However, Uber’s rides business did manage to post $179 million in positive adjusted EBITDA on its own &#8212; down from the company’s Q1 2021 result &#8212; while the company’s delivery business posted another quarter of negative adjusted profits, turning in -$161 million worth of adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<p>Recall that Uber’s ride-hailing adjusted EBITDA pales in comparison to the company’s unallocated expenses; Uber’s adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 came to -$509 million, an improvement of 39% compared to the year-ago period, but still a long way from breakeven.</p>
<p>But Uber’s quarter had a highlight to share in the form of other income. Uber’s operating loss of $1.19 billion was more than ameliorated by the company earning $1.93 billion in nonoperating income. That was mostly derived from $1.91 billion in unrealized gains on “debt and equity securities,” including “a $1.4 billion unrealized gain on [its] Didi investment and a $471 million unrealized gain on [its] Aurora Investments recognized in the second quarter of 2021.”</p>
<p>Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">went public in the second quarter</a>.</p>
<p>Turning to geographic results, Uber’s fastest recovery came in the APAC region, where revenue soared 227% from $217 million in the year-ago quarter to $709 million in the company’s most recent three-month period. EMEA came in second, in growth terms, expanding top line 159% from $358 million to $929 million over the same time frame. The United States and Canada posted revenue growth of 76% from $1.13 billion to $1.98 billion, and Latin America managed a more modest 44% rebound in the quarter.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The future of technology is determined by a handful of venture capitalists. The world’s 10 leading venture capital firms have, together, invested over $150 billion in technology startups. The venture capitalists who run these firms decide which startups today will develop the new platforms and technologies that will shape our lives tomorrow.</p>
<p>There is a startling lack of diversity within the venture capital sector. This means that a small group of men — mostly white men — make decisions that affect all of us. Unsurprisingly, they all too often ignore the broader societal and human rights implications of these investment decisions.</p>
<p>We all live in a world shaped by venture capital. As of 2019, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/state-of-venture-capital-industry-2019">81%</a> of all venture capital funds worldwide are clustered in just a handful of countries, primarily in the U.S., Europe and China, which in turn are shaping the future of technology. If you spend time on Facebook or Twitter, use Google, travel in an Uber or stay in an Airbnb, then you’ve experienced firsthand the impact of venture capital funding.</p>
<p>Venture capital firms, which provide equity financing for early- and growth-stage startups, play a critical gatekeeper role, deciding which new technologies and technology companies will receive funding.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital firms need to institute human rights due diligence processes that meet the standards set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All businesses &#8212; including venture capital &#8212; have a responsibility to respect human rights. In order to ensure that their investments are not undermining our human rights, it is therefore critical for venture capital firms to conduct due diligence processes before making investments.</p>
<p>Amnesty International recently <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/risky-business-top-10-leading-venture-capital-firms-failing-in-their-responsibility-to-respect-human-rights/">surveyed</a> the world’s largest venture capital firms and startup accelerators. Of the world’s 10 largest venture capital firms, not a single one had an adequate human rights due diligence process that met the standards set forth in the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this is true of the broader venture capital sector as well. Overall, of the 50 VC firms and three startup accelerators analyzed by Amnesty International, we found that almost all of them lacked adequate human rights due diligence policies and processes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UEjK0CUDF6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/">Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/embed/#?secret=UEjK0CUDF6" data-secret="UEjK0CUDF6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This failure to carry out adequate due diligence means that a vast majority of VC firms are failing in their responsibility to respect human rights.</p>
<p>This almost complete lack of respect for human rights among the world’s largest venture capital firms has three key impacts. First, and most immediately, it means that venture capital firms invest in companies whose products and services have been implicated in ongoing human rights abuses, such as <a href="http://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii">companies that provide support</a> to the Chinese government’s repression of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang and across China.</p>
<p>Second, it means that venture capital firms continue to fund companies whose business models have a significant negative impact on human rights, including our privacy and labor rights. For instance, leading venture capital firms continue to support companies that rely on app-based or “gig” workers, who often face exploitative or otherwise abusive work conditions, as well as companies whose “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/1404/2019/en/">surveillance capitalism</a>” business model undermines our right to privacy.</p>
<p>Third, the lack of human rights due diligence by venture capital firms dramatically increases the risk that they fund new and “frontier” technologies without ensuring that adequate human rights safeguards are in place.</p>
<p>For instance, the application of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) tools across a wide variety of sectors risks amplifying existing societal biases and discrimination. Seemingly objective algorithms can be biased by reliance on incomplete or unrepresentative training data, and/or by replicating the unconscious bias of those who developed the algorithms.</p>
<p>This is a critical blind spot, especially as VC-funded startups seek to disrupt such fundamental parts of our lives as education, finance and health.</p>
<p>The negative impacts of the VC firms’ lack of human rights due diligence — especially regarding issues like algorithmic bias — are magnified by these firms’ own lack of gender and racial diversity. For instance, women comprise only <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">23%</a> of venture capital investment professionals (i.e., those involved in deciding which startups to fund).</p>
<p>The numbers are even worse when it comes to racial diversity — just <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">4%</a> of investment professionals at VC firms in the U.S. are Latinx, and only 4% are Black. Groups like <a href="https://www.blckvc.org/">Blck VC</a>, <a href="https://www.diversity.vc">Diversity VC</a> and <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/">digitalundivided</a> have been calling attention to this issue for years, but venture capitalists have been slow to respond so far.</p>
<p>This lack of diversity is mirrored in the gender and racial composition of founders who receive VC funding. In 2018, all-female founding teams received just <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/01/28/funding-female-founders-2018/">2.2%</a> of all U.S.-based venture funding. At the same time, Black and Latinx founders received less than <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/23/venture-capital-diversity-equity-black-latino-startups-funding/">2.3%</a> of all U.S.-based venture capital funding in 2019.</p>
<p>With power comes responsibility. Venture capital firms need to institute human rights due diligence processes that meet the standards set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p>
<p>Further, they should provide support to their portfolio companies to ensure that they comply with human rights standards. Venture capital firms should also publicly commit to hiring more diverse teams, especially in investment-related positions. Finally, they should publicly commit to funding more diverse startup founders as part of their flagship funds.</p>
<p>VC firms have a responsibility to ensure that their investments are not causing harm. A responsibility that they have, to date, largely ignored.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese startup ispace has raised $46 million in a fresh round of Series C funding as it looks to complete three lunar lander missions in three years.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward the second and third of the planned missions, scheduled for 2023 and 2024. The first mission, which ispace aims to conduct in the latter half of 2022, is being furnished by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/moon-lander-startup-ispace-raises-28-million-and-launches-a-new-lunar-data-platform/">earlier financing</a>.</p>
<p>The Series C was led by Japanese VC firm Incubate Fund, with additional investment from partnerships managed by Innovation Engine, funds managed by SBI Investment Co., Katsunori Sago, Aizawa Investments and funds managed by HiJoJo Partners and Aizawa Asset Management. Incubate Fund’s investments in ispace stretch back to the company’s seed round in 2014.</p>
<p>Ispace’s total funding now stands at $195.5 million.</p>
<p>The company said last month it had started building the lunar landing flight module for the 2022 mission at a facility owned by space launch company ArianeGroup, in Lampoldshausen, Germany. The lander for that first mission, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/ispace-reveals-the-final-design-of-its-lunar-lander-ahead-of-its-first-mission-to-the-moon-in-2022/">the Hakuto-R</a>, will take three months to reach the moon, largely to save costs and additional weight from propellant. It<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/"> will deliver</a> a 22-pound rover for Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center, a lunar robot for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and payload from three Canadian companies. The lander will reach the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>The 7.5 foot-tall Hakuto-R will also be used in the second mission in 2023, to deposit a small ispace rover that will collect data to support the company&#8217;s subsequent missions to the moon. For the final mission, the Toyko-based startup is developing a larger lander in the United States.</p>

<p>Ispace describes its long-term goal as being a &#8220;gateway for private sector companies to bring their business to the Moon.&#8221; The company has particular interest in helping spur a space-based economy, noting on its <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/">website</a> that the moon&#8217;s water resources represent &#8220;untapped potential.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two decades after businesses first started deploying AI solutions, one can argue that they’ve made little progress in achieving significant gains in efficiency and profitability relative to the hype that drove initial expectations.</p>
<p>On the surface, recent data supports AI skeptics. Almost <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/">90%</a> of data science projects never make it to production; only <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/">20%</a> of analytics insights through 2022 will achieve business outcomes; and even companies that have developed an enterprisewide AI strategy are seeing failure rates of up to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190708005039/en/">50%</a>.</p>
<p>But the past 25 years have only been the first phase in the evolution of enterprise AI — or what we might call Enterprise AI 1.0. That’s where many businesses remain today. However, companies on the leading edge of AI innovation have advanced to the next generation, which will define the coming decade of big data, analytics and automation — Enterprise AI 2.0.</p>
<p>The difference between these two generations of enterprise AI is not academic. For executives across the business spectrum — from healthcare and retail to media and finance — the evolution from 1.0 to 2.0 is a chance to learn and adapt from past failures, create concrete expectations for future uses and justify the rising investment in AI that we see across industries.</p>
<p>Two decades from now, when business leaders look back to the 2020s, the companies who achieved Enterprise AI 2.0 first will have come to be big winners in the economy, having differentiated their services, scooped up market share and positioned themselves for ongoing innovation.</p>
<p>Framing the digital transformations of the future as an evolution from Enterprise AI 1.0 to 2.0 provides a conceptual model for business leaders developing strategies to compete in the age of automation and advanced analytics.</p>
<h2>Enterprise AI 1.0 (the status quo)</h2>
<p>Starting in the mid-1990s, AI was a sector marked by speculative testing, experimental interest and exploration. These activities occurred almost exclusively in the domain of data scientists. As Gartner wrote in a recent <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/">report</a>, these efforts were “alchemy … run by wizards whose talents will not scale in the organization.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook shut down accounts belonging to two academic researchers late Tuesday, cutting off their ability to study political ads and misinformation on the world&#8217;s biggest social network.</p>
<p>The company accused the academics of engaging in &#8220;unauthorized scraping&#8221; and compromising user privacy on the platform, claims that Facebook&#8217;s many critics are slamming as a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/">thin pretense</a> for killing the transparency work.</p>
<p>The company took action against Laura Edelson and Damon McCoy, two well-known researchers affiliated with<a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/"> NYU&#8217;s Cybersecurity for Democracy project</a> who have long sparred with the company. The move cuts off their access to Facebook&#8217;s Ad Library — one of the company&#8217;s only meaningful transparency efforts to date — and data on popular posts from the social media monitoring service CrowdTangle.</p>
<p>Facebook has a history with Edelson and McCoy. The company served the pair cease and desist letters<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/facebooks-threat-to-the-nyu-ad-observatory-is-an-attack-on-ethical-research/"> just weeks before the 2020 election</a>, calling on the team to disable an opt-in browser tool called Ad Observer and unpublish their findings. Ad Observer is a <a href="https://adobserver.org/">browser tool anyone can install</a> that&#8217;s designed to give researchers a rare glimpse into how Facebook targets the ads that have transformed it into a trillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last several years, we’ve used this access to uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, identify misinformation in political ads including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation,&#8221; Edelson said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, including our work measuring vaccine misinformation with the<a href="https://www.viralityproject.org/"> Virality Project</a> and many other partners who rely on our data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident set off a fresh round of criticism about the company&#8217;s preference for opacity over transparency when it comes to some of the more dangerous behavior that the platform incubates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By Wednesday, Facebook&#8217;s actions had attracted the attention of some members of Congress. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) criticized Facebook&#8217;s decision to punish the researchers under the pretense of protecting users in light of the company&#8217;s long history of invasive privacy practices. Wyden also called Facebook&#8217;s bluff over its claim that revoking researcher access is an effort to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">comply with a privacy order from the FTC</a> that the company was issued for its previous user privacy violations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After years of abusing users&#39; privacy, it&#39;s rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems. I&#39;ve asked the FTC to confirm that this excuse is as bogus as it sounds. <a href="https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9">https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1422961646096424963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) also weighed in on Facebook&#8217;s latest controversy, calling the decision &#8220;deeply concerning.&#8221; Warner praised independent researchers for &#8220;consistently [improving] the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s past time for Congress to act to bring greater transparency to the shadowy world of online advertising, which continues to be a major vector for fraud and misconduct,&#8221; Warner said.</p>
<p>Firefox developer Mozilla came to the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/">defense of Ad Observer</a> on Wednesday, noting that the company &#8220;reviewed it twice, conducting both a code review and examining the consent flow&#8221; before recommending the browser extension through its storefront. In a blog post, Mozilla&#8217;s chief security officer stated that Facebook&#8217;s claims &#8220;simply do not hold water.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/researchers-nyu-knight-institute-condemn-facebooks-effort-to-squelch-independent-research-about-misinformation">free press organizations</a>, researchers and misinformation experts also condemned Facebook&#8217;s decision Wednesday. &#8220;Facebook’s cavalier approach to privacy enabled it to become so dominant,&#8221; <a href="https://themarkup.org/press-release-20210804">The Markup&#8217;s Julia Angwin and Nabiha Syed</a> wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now, when independent researchers want to interrogate that platform and the influence it commands, Facebook is propping up user privacy as a shield to hide behind.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. </strong></p>
<p><strong>While I’m immensely appreciative of my company’s sponsorship and that I made it through the H-1B lottery and am working, I’m stuck in a rut. I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seeking Satisfaction near Stanford</strong></p>
<p>Dear Seeking,</p>
<p>A couple of exciting immigration news updates to get us started today! In <a href="https://bit.ly/3fsIUZ0">breaking startup founder news</a>, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/media/press-releases/lofgren-introduces-legislation-create-new-visa-program-immigrant-entrepreneurs">LIKE Act</a> for startup founders in the House of Representatives last week. Below, we’ll share what this could mean for your startup aspirations. Also, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducted a second H-1B lottery because it didn’t receive enough H-1B petitions to meet the annual cap. So, if you or your employer were selected, be sure to file an H-1B petition by November 3.</p>
<p>Although job dissatisfaction and frustration on an H-1B can be normal, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardgorbis/">Edward Gorbis</a>, there’s a lot you can do to take control of your U.S. immigration situation and go out on your own. I interviewed Gorbis for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/076-coaching-immigrant-leaders-with-edward-gorbis/">my podcast</a>; he’s the founder of <a href="https://www.careermeetsworld.com/">Career Meets World</a> and a performance coach who works with immigrants and first-generation professionals to help them find fulfillment and thrive in their careers and life. Gorbis said that “once immigrants reach stability, they start to think, ‘Who am I, what do I value, what’s my core identity?’” It’s possible for any of us to retrain our brain for success.</p>
<p>Gorbis said that imagining overcoming the hurdles that stand in the way of doing the work that will fulfill you is the first step. So, here are some options that can help you imagine how to build the life of your dreams.</p>
<h2>Become a founding CEO and raise $250,000</h2>
<p>A great new option for aspiring entrepreneurs is <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP), a new immigration program in the United States that allows CEOs, CTOs and others to live in the U.S. and run their company for 2.5 years with an option for a 2.5-year extension. Your spouse can obtain a work permit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Entrepreneur-Parole.pdf?7fd8bf&amp;7fd8bf">How to qualify?</a> You need to own at least 10% of a U.S. company, such as a Delaware C corporation registered in California. Ideally, you’ll want to show that your company bank account has at least $250,000 raised from qualified U.S. investors, but you can use other evidence to demonstrate that your company has the potential to grow rapidly and create jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>A startup visa and path to a green card may be soon on the way for entrepreneurs and their crucial employees: Last week, Lofgren introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/lofgren.house.gov/files/7.26.21%20-%20LIKE%20Act%20Full%20Text.pdf">Let Immigrants Kickstart Employment (LIKE) Act</a>. The requirements for the proposed startup visa are the same as for IEP but would allow a longer stay &#8212; up to eight years total if the startup creates jobs and generates substantial revenue.</p>
<p>I’m <a href="https://bit.ly/3fsIUZ0">very proud</a> to have aided in drafting the LIKE Act. It’s a thrill to see how my suggestions were included, such as making Startup Green Cards not subject to the visa bulletin, clarifying that you can seek consecutive Startup Visas from different companies, how to allocate employee visas to startups, ensuring the Startup Visa is a dual intent status, and adding premium processing. It was such a joy to be able to contribute ideas to this amazing process. I look forward to supporting this bill to become a law; please reach out to me if you want to support this worthy cause.</p>

<h2>See yourself at another company</h2>
<p>There is technically no limit to how many <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> employers you can have or how many — or few — hours you work in an H-1B position. So, think about other companies.</p>
<p>One option would be to have concurrent H-1Bs: Keep your current H-1B job for stability and start your own company, preferably with another individual or two, and have your startup sponsor you for an H-1B. Take a look at this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/#:~:text=But%20yes%2C%20it%20is%20possible,to%20work%20at%20the%20startup.">Dear Sophie column</a> for what to do before embarking on this path.</p>
<p>Another option would be to <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/h-1b/031-h-1b-nitty-gritty-2-h-1b-transfer-for-startup-founders/">transfer your H-1B</a> to another employer, or your own startup if you are going to work there. Since you already went through the H-1B lottery with your current employer, you will not have to go through the lottery process again for a second H-1B whether you choose the concurrent or transfer option.</p>
<p>Setting up a startup that can sponsor you for an H-1B is complicated, so I suggest you work with both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney. Keep in mind that you will not be able to do any work for your startup until an H-1B with your startup has been approved, which is why having co-founders is helpful. Another reason is H-1Bs require an employer-employee relationship between a startup and the H-1B candidate. That means a co-founder — or the startup’s board — must supervise you and have the ability to fire you. Moreover, we often advise founders that it may be best to own less than a 50% stake in the startup when applying for an H-1B.</p>
<h2>Consider a green card</h2>
<p>If you end up pursuing concurrent H-1Bs, consider asking your employer whether it is willing to sponsor you for a green card. If that’s not the case, your startup can sponsor you for one, or you can self-petition for a green card:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A extraordinary ability green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-advanced-degree/">EB-2 green card for professionals holding advanced degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-exceptional-ability/">EB-2 exceptional ability green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-3-green-card-skilled-workers-professionals">EB-3 green cards for skilled workers and professionals</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All EB-2 green cards — except the EB-2 NIW — and the EB-3 green card require labor certification approval (<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">PERM</a>) from the U.S. Department of Labor. The two green cards that allow an individual to self-sponsor are the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW.</p>
<h2>Imagine yourself doing gigs in your field</h2>
<p>Many startup founders qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/o-1a-extraordinary-ability/">O-1A</a> extraordinary ability visa. However, you cannot have both an H-1B and an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A</a> at the same time, so if your startup sponsors you for an O-1A, you will be required to leave your current H-1B job once an O-1A is approved.</p>
<p>An O-1A offers more flexibility than an H-1B. You can work for a single petitioning company or on multiple gigs through an agent. However, qualifying for an O-1A is more difficult than an H-1B. Resources, such as through my firm, support people with getting qualified. The one similarity with the H-1B is that you must show your startup and you have an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<h2>Invest in your own company</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/">E-2 visa</a> for treaty investors and employees is ideal for startup founders whose home country has a treaty of commerce and navigation with the U.S. Here is a list of <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/treaty.html">treaty countries</a>. For more details on E-2 visas for founders and employees, check out this previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-best-option-for-international-founders-to-expand-in-the-us/">Dear Sophie column</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/016-e-2-visa-for-founders-and-employees/">podcast episode</a>.</p>
<p>Although there is no minimum dollar amount that a founder must invest in a startup to qualify for an E-2, we often advise founders to invest at least $100,000 to have a strong case. You cannot have both an H-1B and an E-2, so you will need to leave your current H-1B job if your E-2 is approved.</p>
<p>An immigration attorney can offer additional options based on your personal circumstances and legal advice tailored to you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey of building your dreams!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dating app maker and Tinder parent Match Group said during its Q2 <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/match-sales-grow-faster-than-expected-as-u-s-dating-scene-recovers-but-earnings-miss-hits-stock-11628021471">earnings</a> it will bring audio and video chat, including group live video, and other livestreaming technologies to several of the company&#8217;s brands over the next 12 to 24 months. The developments will be powered by innovations from Hyperconnect, the social networking company that this year became Match&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date when it bought the Korean app maker for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">a sizable $1.73 billion. </a></p>
<p>Since then, Match Group has been relatively quiet about its specific plans for Hyperconnect&#8217;s tech or its longer-term strategy with the operation, although Tinder was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tinder-tested-group-video-chat-ahead-of-matchs-move-into-social-discovery-with-hyperconnect-deal/">briefly spotted testing a group video chat</a> feature called Tinder Mixer earlier this summer. The move had seemed to signal some exploration of social discovery features in the wake of the Hyperconnect deal. However, Tinder told us at the time the company had no plans to bring that specific product to market in the year ahead.</p>
<p>On Tuesday&#8217;s earnings, Match Group offered a little more insight into the future of Hyperconnect, following the acquisition&#8217;s official <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/match-group-closes-acquisition-of-hyperconnect-301314582.html">close</a> in mid-June.</p>
<p>According to Match Group CEO Shar Dubey, who <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/match-group-names-sharmistha-dubey-chief-executive-officer-300994817.html">stepped into the top job</a> last January, the company is excited about the potential to integrate technologies Hyperconnect has developed into existing Match-owned dating apps.</p>
<p>This includes, she said, &#8220;AR features, self-expression tools, conversational AI and a number of what we would consider metaverse elements, which have the element to transform the online meeting and getting-to-know-each-other process,&#8221; Dubey explained, without offering further specific details about how the products would work or which apps would receive these enhancements.</p>
<p>Many of these technologies emerged from Hyperconnect&#8217;s lab, <a href="http://3.112.16.158/hyper-x/?lang=en">Hyper X</a> &#8212; the same in-house incubator <a href="http://3.112.16.158/hyper-x/?lang=en">whose first product</a> is now one of the company&#8217;s flagship apps, Azar, which joined Match Group with the acquisition.</p>
<p>Dubey also noted that the work to begin these tech integrations was already underway at the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By year-end, Match Group said it expects to have at least two of its brands integrated with technologies from Hyperconnect. A number of other brands will implement Hyperconnect capabilities by year-end 2022.</p>
<p>In doing so, Match aims to transform what people think of when it comes to online dating.</p>
<p>To date, online dating has been a fairly static experience across the industry, where apps focus largely on profiles and photos, and then offer some sort of matching technique &#8212; whether swipes or quizzes or something else. Tinder, in more recent years, began to break out of that mold as it innovated with an array of different experiences, like its choose-your-own-adventure in-app video series, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/tinders-interactive-video-event-swipe-night-will-launch-in-international-markets-this-month/">&#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221;</a> <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">video profiles</a>, instant chat features (via Tinder&#8217;s product, <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">Hot Takes</a>) and others. But it still lacked some of the real-time elements that people have when meeting one another in the real world.</p>
<p>This is an area where Match believes Hyperconnect can help to improve the online dating experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the holy grails for us in online dating has always been to bridge the disconnect that happens between people chatting online and then meeting someone in person,&#8221; Dubey said. &#8220;These technologies will eventually allow us to build experiences that will help people determine if they have that much elusive chemistry or not&#8230; Our ultimate vision here is for people to never have to go on a bad first date again,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Of course, Match Group&#8217;s positioning of the Hyperconnect deal as being more interesting because the innovation it brings &#8212; and not just the standalone apps it operates &#8212; also comes at a time when those apps have not met the company&#8217;s expectations on revenue.</p>
<p>In the second half the of 2021, Match Group said it expects Hyperconnect to contribute to $125 to $135 million in revenue &#8212; a financial outlook that the company admits reflects some pullback. It attributed this largely to COVID impacts, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where Hyperconnect&#8217;s apps operate. Other impacts to Hyperconnect&#8217;s growth included a more crowded marketplace and Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">changes</a> to IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers), which has impacted a number of apps &#8212; including other social networking apps, like Facebook.</p>
<p>While Match still believes Hyperconnect will post &#8220;solid revenue growth&#8221; in 2021, it said that these new technology integrations into the Match Group portfolio are now &#8220;a higher priority&#8221; for the company.</p>
<p>Match Group posted mixed <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/match-sales-grow-faster-than-expected-as-u-s-dating-scene-recovers-but-earnings-miss-hits-stock-11628021471">earnings</a> in Q1, with revenue of $707.8 million, above analyst estimates, but earnings per share of 46 cents, below projections of 49 cents a share. Paying customers grew 15% to 15 million, up from 13 million in the year-ago quarter. Shares declined by 7% on Wednesday morning, following the earnings announcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cameo app, where celebrities send video messages to paying fans, has taken off globally. But now the concept is set to come to the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
<p>Tech startup <a href="http://yela.com">YELA</a> has secured $2 million in investment to support its launch, and will — similar to Cameo — offer users the opportunity to get close to their idols via voice, video and direct text messages.</p>
<p>The investment is led by U.S investors Justin Mateen (co-founder of Tinder) and general partner of JAM Fund, joined by Sean Rad (co-founder Tinder) and general partner of RAD Fund. Participation from the U.S. also includes Graph Ventures, championed by Razmig Hovaghimian (board member at Rakuten). In addition, U.K investment comes from Samos Fund, Ascension Ventures, and from MENA-based Hambro Perks Oryx Fund, who joined the round.</p>
<p>The twist is that YELA plans to sign some big celebrities known in the region, but less so in the Western world. That doesn’t mean the market is small. There are over 365 million Arabic speakers online and over 65% of the population is under 35. Meanwhile, smartphone penetration is very high.</p>
<p>Alex Eid, CEO and co-founder of YELA said: &#8220;There is a huge appetite in the MENA market for a premium offering in the creator space.”</p>
<p>He said YELA has onboarded high-profile celebrities, confirming A-list signees including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_Diab">Amr Diab</a>, the multiaward-winning Egyptian singer, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa_Wehbe">Haifa Wehbe</a>, three-time Big Apple Music Award winner, amongst others.</p>
<p>YELA will launch in August 2021 with prices starting from $100.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">COVID Tech Connect, a nonprofit created during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, is launching a free app aimed at helping hospital patients call home. As the delta variant drives a new upward surge in critical COVID-19 cases, the new offering is, sadly, well timed.</p>
<p>COVID Tech Connect originated as a nonprofit organization in spring 2020, right before the initial summer surge in COVID-19 cases. At the time, the initiative was dedicated to collecting and donating hardware — tablets, phones, etc. — to hospitals where ICU beds were filling up, and COVID protocols prevented families from visiting sick relatives. So far, the organization has donated over 20,000 devices to 1,600 hospitals and care facilities, and 30,000 charging cords to an additional 248 hospitals.</p>
<p>The nonprofit is headed by a roster of proven entrepreneurs, including <a href="https://www.anjalikumar.com/">Anjali Kumar,</a> <a href="https://benishshah.com/">Benish Shah</a>, <a href="http://www.christinawallace.com/entrepreneur">Christina Wallace</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/katie-jacobs-stanton">Katie Stanton</a>, <a href="https://www.kristinalibby.com/">Kristina Libby</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sararodell/">Sarah Rodell</a>. Since 2020, COVID Tech Connect has been run by <a href="ttps://www.linkedin.com/in/elien-blue-becque-8487aa7/">Elien Becque</a>, also an entrepreneur and the non-profit&#8217;s product director and program manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karaivy/">Kara Goldberg-King</a>.</p>
<p>The device donation program was promoted to hospitals, but never actively promoted to care facilities. Still, the program generated organic interest among those facilities too. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t really put anything behind it [promoting to care facilities], but we were always being flooded with requests for devices,&#8221; Elien Becque, product director at COVID Tech Connect tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>During its first year, COVID Tech Connect raised $4 million in funding from a variety of sources including Google.org, private donors, including <a href="https://www.covidtechconnect.com/our-story">Ellen DeGeneres and Shutterfly</a>, and about $200,000 from a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/GivingDignity">GoFundMe</a>. Right now, COVID Tech Connect’s fiscal sponsor is The Giving Back Fund, another nonprofit that manages charitable donations from pro athletes, celebrities or high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>About one year after its original debut, COVID Tech Connect expanded into software with an app called <a href="https://www.telehomeapp.com/">TeleHome</a>. TeleHome, which soft launched in May, is a device-agnostic, HIPAA-compliant way to perform a video call within a hospital.</p>
<p>The TeleHome rollout comes during a confusing and critical time in the pandemic. While some hospital systems are now allowing visitors, others, like some <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article252902678.html">Florida hospitals</a>, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/jackson-library/notices/COVID-19-Visitor-Policy.pdf">are suspending</a> or limiting visits in response to the delta variant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Generally speaking, the CDC still recommends hospitals facilitate other ways for patients to visit with family — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/non-us-settings/hcf-visitors.html">especially video or audio calls</a>.</p>
<p>The TeleHome app was designed through a partnership with Caregility, a for-profit company that already provides telehealth services for hospitals. Caregility provided the back-end functionality for the app, while the front end was developed by COVID Tech Connect’s team.</p>
<p>“The idea for TeleHome was born out of conversations that the COVID Tech Connect team was having with hospitals about the specific use case of using smart devices to connect patients in hospital settings,” says Becque.</p>
<p>“The whole point of TeleHome really was to make our mission scalable beyond just the physical devices.”</p>
<p>The obvious critique of yet another video calling app is that it’s already a flooded space, though TeleHome does offer some services that are unique, and that make the app particularly useful for hospitals.</p>
<p>Hospitals have already used apps like FaceTime to connect patients with their families with success. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7571754/">2020 study</a> on the effects of 350 FaceTime calls made in U.K. hospitals noted that the feedback was “very positive.” But the hospitals did run into IT issues — the use of FaceTime software, the study notes, limited calls to relatives who own Apple devices. (Apple’s new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/ios-15-brings-powerful-new-features-to-stay-connected-focus-explore-and-more/">iOS 15 operating system</a> will allow Android and Windows-based devices to run FaceTime, however, once it&#8217;s released widely in the fall).</p>
<p>By comparison TeleHome works on any device. A hospital can request a TeleHome login (provided again, for free). Once it’s installed using that one-time login, patients can use a hospital’s device to send a link via text to another person. Clicking that link will take participants to a Zoom-call like format in an internet browser — regardless of whether they have an iPhone, Android, computer or any other type of device.</p>
<p>“TeleHome was a natural extension for us beyond hardware and into software, especially for those hospitals that couldn&#8217;t accept the Android devices from us,” Kara Goldberg-King, program manager at COVID Tech Health tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>TeleHome also comes with some privacy features that may be attractive to hospitals. To address patient privacy mandates by HIPAA requirements, Becque notes that “literally no data is collected.” There is evidence that a call link was generated but there are no recordings, logs or transcripts and the link itself expires after five minutes.</p>
<p>So far, the app has about 3,400 downloads.</p>
<p>The one thing TeleHome can’t get around is the need for a device in the first place, though COVID Tech Connect does donate devices as well, addressing that concern in part. But it does cut out technical details usually required to get a call up and running.</p>
<p>TechCrunch conducted about half of this interview with Becque and Goldberg-King over the TeleHome platform –– the platform works relatively seamlessly, provided you don’t have strict privacy settings limiting microphone or camera use. A test run of the video chat service worked like a charm on a computer, but I struggled to get the chat up and running while navigating the microphone or camera permissions menus on an iPhone.</p>
<p>There are some signs that some of the infrastructure of COVID Tech Connect may outlast the pandemic. For instance, COVID Tech Connect is in touch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/ameelio-wants-to-take-on-for-profit-prison-calling-rackets-after-starting-with-free-letters-to-inmates/">Ameelio</a>, an app that allows incarcerated people and their families to send letters and schedule video calls for free. But for now, COVID Tech Connect remains focused on the problem it set out to solve: closing the gulf between COVID-19 patients who enter the hospital and families on the outside.</p>
<p>As long as the nonprofit exists, the workforce plans to keep the service free.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re really grateful to have been able to execute on the mission with TeleHome and make it scalable and we are not going to turn it into a company,” Becque adds. “It’s free now and it’s always going to be free.”</p>

This [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boeing&#8217;s Starliner capsule is <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/08/03/nasa-boeing-standing-down-on-aug-4-starliner-launch-attempt/">leaving the launchpad</a> after a series of delays that prevented takeoff over the last few days. NASA and the beleaguered aerospace giant will take &#8220;whatever time is necessary&#8221; to find and fix the issue, but it&#8217;s beginning to feel like this long-in-development spacecraft may never make it to the ISS.</p>
<p>This is the second major launch attempt after the Starliner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">failed to enter the correct orbit in a 2019 launch</a>. The rescheduled ISS rendezvous launch was originally scheduled for March of this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/watch-boeing-try-its-pivotal-crew-spacecraft-orbital-demonstration-launch-for-the-second-time/">but eventually delayed to this week</a>. A valve issue prompted a countdown halt yesterday, but the ground teams have been unable to resolve the problem as the whole operation has had to stand down as a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Engineering teams have ruled out a number of potential causes, including software, but additional time is needed to complete the assessment,&#8221; wrote NASA in a news release. &#8220;Mission teams have decided to roll the Atlas V and Starliner back to the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for further inspection and testing where access to the spacecraft is available. Boeing will power down the Starliner spacecraft this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another major setback for Boeing&#8217;s shot at providing crew launch capability, something its rival SpaceX has achieved now multiple times despite originally working on a very similar timeline. Both experienced years of delays, but ultimately Crew Dragon was successfully piloted to the ISS while Starliner has yet to make a successful orbital trip at all, let alone one with astronauts on board.</p>

<p>Some may wonder whether this is throwing good money after bad, since the race is apparently lost. But Boeing knows better than many that this is a marathon, not a sprint, and that the demand for orbital launches is nearly insatiable. Even if SpaceX has a multiyear lead on Boeing, Boeing has a multiyear lead on some of its other competitors and if it can get Starliner working there will likely be enough customers to make even its tortuous development worthwhile.</p>
<p>Depending on how quickly this valve issue is resolved, it could be weeks or months before there&#8217;s another launch attempt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Florida-based <a href="https://hackeru.com/">HackerU</a>, which creates cybersecurity and other digital skills programs, is acquiring <a href="https://www.cybintsolutions.com/">Cybint</a>, a SaaS-based cyber education company. TechCrunch sources understand this to be a $50 million acquisition, though both companies declined to comment on the price.</p>
<p>HackerU provided digital workforce training to students, post-graduate professionals and the community in the U.S., Europe and Asia through partnerships with universities. The acquisition will mean the combined entity’s geographic footprint will now increase, and it will now rebrand as ThriveDX, standing for &#8220;digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cybint had previously raised $7.5 million thus far. HackerU has been around for 15 years and in the past four years raised around $100 million from Prytek, as well as Liquidity Capital and Shintilla Cap. The company had a number of global initiatives including a partnership with Southern New Hampshire University, where it created boot camps training cybersecurity skills and preparing Black and refugee students based in southeast Africa through remote training for long-term job opportunities.</p>
<p>ThriveDX’s main competitor will be 2U, which <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/2u-acquires-trilogy-education-for-750m/">acquired</a> Trilogy in 2019 for $750 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dan Vigdor, co-founder and executive chairman of HackerU said: &#8220;The combination of our two companies’ positions the new ThriveDX group as the category leader worldwide and solidifies our ability to reskill and upskill individuals at any stage of their professional life.”</p>
<p>Both rising incidences of cybersecurity breaches and the switch to remote working means the cyber world is booming right now — but there is a huge shortage of staff. According to ISC2, some 3.1 million cybersecurity vacancies were left unfilled in 2020, with 63% of corporations reporting their employees are underqualified in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Vigdor added: “The pandemic accelerated a huge transformation across the global workforce, leaving companies in dire need of workers with specific skills — and job candidates in need of training.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roy Zur, founder and CEO of Cybint said: “The Cybint team will support HackerU by signing additional partnerships and accelerating the development of software as a service (SaaS) training solutions with a strong emphasis on corporate training and cybersecurity education solutions globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six months after raising $55 million in a Series C round of funding, SMB 401(k) provider Human Interest today announced it has raised $200 million in a round that propels it to unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise Fund, TPG’s global impact investing platform, led the round and was joined by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The financing included participation from new investor Crosslink Capital and existing backers NewView Capital, Glynn Capital, U.S. Venture Partners, Wing Venture Capital, Uncork Capital, Slow Capital, Susa Ventures and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the San Francisco-based company has raised $305 million. With the latest financing, it has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now raised a total of $336.7 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MpF0TubBI3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/401k-provider-human-interest-doubles-valuation-with-55m-fundraise/">401(k) provider Human Interest doubles valuation with $55M fundraise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;401(k) provider Human Interest doubles valuation with $55M fundraise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/401k-provider-human-interest-doubles-valuation-with-55m-fundraise/embed/#?secret=MpF0TubBI3" data-secret="MpF0TubBI3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company admittedly has an IPO in its sights, as evidenced by the appointment of former Yodlee CFO Mike Armsby to the role of CFO at Human Interest. It&#8217;s targeting a traditional IPO sometime in 2023, with execs saying the target is to have &#8220;$200 million+ in run-rate revenue before going public.&#8221; Currently, it&#8217;s at &#8220;tens of millions of run-rate revenue&#8221; now, and adding millions of new revenue each month.</span></p>
<p>Human Interest’s digital retirement benefits platform allows users “to launch a retirement plan in minutes and put it on autopilot,” according to the company.  It also touts that it has eliminated all 401(k) transaction fees<b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for 401(k)s by SMBs appears to be at an all-time high, with Human Interest reporting that its sales tripled over the last year. The company has also more than doubled its headcount over the last 12 months to 350 employees.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup said it is seeing strong adoption in verticals that have not previously had retirement benefits, including construction, retail, manufacturing, restaurants, nonprofits and hospitality. For example, over the past three quarters, Human Interest has seen 4.5x customer growth in the restaurant sector. Since the start of the pandemic, Human Interest has experienced 2x higher enrollment growth among hourly workers than salaried workers, and hourly worker assets have tripled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Promoting financial health is a core investment pillar for The Rise Fund. Human Interest delivers one of the most compelling solutions to the persistent problem that roughly half of Americans will not have enough savings when they reach retirement age,” said Maya Chorengel, co-managing partner at The Rise Fund, in a written statement. “Despite recent legislation, primarily at the state level, legacy programs have not, to date, produced the same participant outcomes as Human Interest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it will be using its new capital to expand its network of integrations and partnerships with financial advisers, benefits brokers and payroll companies. It also expects to, naturally, do some hiring –– another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 200 employees by year’s end, primarily in its product, engineering and revenue teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 401(k) for SMB space is heating up as of late. In June, competitor Guideline </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210616005127/en/Guideline-Raises-200M-in-Funding-Led-by-General-Atlantic-to-Fuel-Growth-of-Comprehensive-Retirement-Plan-Solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised $200 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a round led by General Atlantic. </span></p>

Since the Tetra doesn&#8217;t require any plumbing, the only thing you need to connect it to is an electrical outlet. The appliance has a three-liter tank you fill with water manually.

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dishwasher" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">dishwasher</a> can wash and dry three place settings worth of dishes per load.

However, Heatworks claims the machine requires less water than handwashing and rinsing the dishes.</p>
<p>There are several settings, including a &#8220;fruit&#8221; one for washing produce. In addition, the dishwasher uses recyclable cartridges with concentrated detergent in an attempt to reduce waste.</p>
<p>The Tetra also requires less power than a standard dishwasher, according to the company. To heat up water, Heatworks uses Ohmic Array Technology, as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-the-plumbing-free-countertop-dishwa-1847395855" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> notes. The Tetra takes a microwave-style approach to heating water rather than harnessing traditional metal elements. It <a href="https://myheatworks.com/blogs/press/heatworks-announces-tetra-the-connected-countertop-dishwasher-at-ces" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">uses</a> graphite electrodes and &#8220;advanced electronic controls&#8221; to excite natural minerals in water. That setup allows the Tetra to efficiently heat water and maintain precise temperature control, according to Heatworks.</p>
<p>While there are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VR22832/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=63145939387785dd7b5b8b2e58a8720d&amp;creativeASIN=B07VR22832" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">other countertop dishwashers</a> that don&#8217;t need a plumbing connection, the Tetra has a smaller water tank than many of its rivals. Farberware&#8217;s FDW05ASBWHA model (which is currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VR22832/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=63145939387785dd7b5b8b2e58a8720d&amp;creativeASIN=B07VR22832&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">$340</a>) has a five-liter capacity. The Tetra may heat water more efficiently than other models as well.</p>
<p>The Tetra will typically cost $499, but Heatworks is offering a $100 discount to those who <a href="https://myheatworks.com/products/tetra-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">lock in a preorder now</a>. The detergent cartridges will cost around $6 each and they should be good for 20 loads depending on the setting and load capacity. Heatworks expects to start shipping the Tetra by May 18th, 2022, which is No Dirty Dishes Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s a little known fact that the carbon footprint of the technology sector is greater than <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/digital-services-have-a-greater-carbon-footprint-than-aviation-does-research-project-aims-at">the entire aviation industry</a> (Aalto University and LUT University). At the same time, tech companies (like many others) are generally attracted to carbon <em>offsetting</em><em> schemes which don’t actually remove carbon from the environment and are often </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts">riddled with flaws</a>.</p>
<p>Only carbon <em>removal</em> offsets contribute toward net zero because they actively take carbon out of the sky. And yet, so far there are very few schemes making carbon removal a focus, largely because only the biggest companies are able to play in this space, partly due to cost and the nascent nature of the technology.</p>
<p>This is where new startup <a href="https://gosupercritical.com/">Supercritical</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The startup says its platform can help businesses get to net zero by measuring their climate impact and selling high-impact carbon removal offsets.</p>
<p>It has now raised £2 million / $2.7 million in pre-seed funding led by London’s LocalGlobe venture firm. The raise is also significant because the team was that which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/14/warner-music-group-buys-concert-discovery-service-songkick/">took Songkick to exit</a>.</p>
<p>Supercritical says its platform assesses a company’s carbon impact, creates an actionable plan for reducing their emissions and recommends a portfolio of high-quality carbon removal offsets for companies to purchase. It will effectively be building a marketplace of carbon removal projects such as enhanced weathering, bio-oil sequestration and direct air capture.</p>
<p>Right now these technologies tend to be costly, as many are so early in development, but the opportunity is for Supercritical to become a market-maker for these emerging solutions, aggregating demand to help them scale and innovate faster.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup already has clients, including accuRx, Tide and what3words. Supercritical is also a member of the <a href="https://techzero.technation.io/">TechZero</a> task force, a group of U.K. tech companies claiming to work toward NetZero Carbon impact.</p>
<p>Supercritical CEO and co-founder Michelle You said: “Businesses are rightly suspicious of traditional carbon offsetting options, which do nothing at best and at worst are outright fraud, but most companies lack the time and the expertise to find an adequate alternative. Our mission is to make it possible for any business to start the journey to net zero. Climate action can’t just be the reserve of the world’s biggest companies, and this is a crisis that can’t wait.”</p>

<p>Remus Brett, who led the investment from LocalGlobe, said: “Supercritical is providing a service that is as timely as it is essential. With COP26 approaching, the question of how businesses can meaningfully address their climate impact is a critical CEO issue. We are excited to be backing the exceptional team at Supercritical as they scale the only platform that helps companies focus their efforts on carbon removal rather than offsets.”</p>
<p>The startup is pushing at an open door.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said Wednesday it is adding two new zero-emissions vehicles to its commercial portfolio as it looks to expand its first-to-last-mile business arm, BrightDrop.</p>
<p>The first vehicle will be a battery electric cargo van under the Chevrolet brand that will likely be similar to the popular Chevy Express van. The second will be a medium-duty truck that CEO Mary Barra said “will put both the Ultium and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology to work.”</p>
<p>Much has been made of GM’s commitment to invest in electric passenger vehicles, but the company has also been busy targeting commercial customers with zero-emitting technologies. GM&#8217;s go-to technologies are battery electric and hydrogen fuel cells for heavy-duty and long-haul purposes.</p>

<p>GM in January said it would supply Hydrotec Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power Cubes to trucking manufacturer Navistar, with the first hydrogen trucks anticipated to go on sale in 2024. The automaker also penned a deal with Wabtec to develop hydrogen fuel cells and batteries for locomotives.</p>
<p>GM launched BrightDrop in January in a bid to offer commercial customers, starting with a contract with FedEx, an ecosystem of electric and connected products.</p>
<p>BrightDrop started with two main products, an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop executives previously hinted that the business unit was working on other products, including a medium-distance vehicle that transports multiple electric pallets known as EP1 and rapid load delivery vehicle concept.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Between these new trucks, BrightDrop, EV pickups coming from Chevrolet and GMC, and our work with Wabtec on locomotives, and Navistar on semi trucks, we will have electric solutions for almost any towing or hauling job you can imagine,” Barra said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In spite of the pandemic, New York City remains the center of commerce and business, and over the last decade a robust startup community has developed there. <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/">Work-Bench</a>, the NYC VC firm that concentrates on early-stage enterprise seed investments, announced its $100 million Fund 3 this morning.</p>
<p>The company started back in 2013, when most investment was still concentrated in Silicon Valley, but founders Jonathan Lehr and Jessica Lin believed there was room for a new firm in NYC that concentrated on writing first checks for enterprise startups. The founding team knew IT and believed that with the concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the city, they could build something that took advantage of that proximity.</p>
<p>The bet has paid off in a big way with investments in successful startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/">Cockroach Labs</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/catalyst-raises-15m-from-accel-to-transform-data-driven-customer-success/">Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/dialpad-raises-100m-series-e-at-a-1-2b-valuation/">Dialpad</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/">FireHydrant</a> (all companies TechCrunch has covered). Big exits include CoreOs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/red-hat-acquirescoreos-for-250-million-in-kubernetes-expansion/">which Red Hat acquired</a> for $250 million in 2018.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NYC&#8217;s Work-Bench announces $47M enterprise investment fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/nycs-work-bench-announces-47m-enterprise-investment-fund/embed/#?secret=mTMdSWtCuY" data-secret="mTMdSWtCuY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Writing <a href="https://medium.com/work-bench/announcing-our-100m-work-bench-fund-3-1b1a8132b84e">in a blog post</a> announcing the new fund, Lehr and Lin said their initial idea has grown far beyond anything they could have hoped for in those early days. &#8220;By utilizing our deep corporate network of Fortune 500 customers here in NYC, we can get conviction in companies early on, and before they have the metrics other VC firms require. It’s also through this network of customers that we can land critical early customer logos and through our extensive community events and playbooks that we can enable pivotal knowledge sharing,&#8221; the two founders wrote.</p>
<p>Lehr says, even with the pandemic, which could have allowed it to expand its reach, the company is mostly sticking to its NYC focus with the majority of investments based there. &#8220;This may sound ironic, but while businesses went virtual, the pandemic reinforced our focus on New York City. Our city was hit first and hardest by COVID, but despite it all, VC funding activity for local enterprise startups actually increased substantially during the pandemic. Along with that, with so many Fortune 500s in NYC all going through accelerated digital transformation during the pandemic, there was a ton of work to be done and numerous customer opportunities right here in our own backyard,&#8221; Lehr said.</p>
<p>He says that the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/nycs-work-bench-announces-47m-enterprise-investment-fund/"> $47 million Fund 2 portfolio</a> was deployed to 70% NYC-based startups, and he predicts that Fund 3 will have a similar composition, if not slightly more concentrated in New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t just decide to write first checks though, it tried to build the community by offering workspace in their offices where early-stage companies could feed off one another (at least until the pandemic came along). The founders have also offered events where various speakers came to their offices, hosting hundreds of events since inception, while going virtual when the pandemic closed down in-person gatherings.</p>
<p>Lehr says as the company deploys Fund 3 money, it is looking for ways to invest in a more diverse group of founders. &#8220;Right now, 20% of our portfolio is made up of women founders. While we are proud of that number within an enterprise context, we believe there is so much room for improvement. As we’ve learned, deal flow doesn’t become diverse on its own &#8212; you need to make it diverse, which is why we place a huge emphasis on identifying and amplifying the voices of women and diverse founders within our own Investment Committee meetings and across the rest of the VC and enterprise tech community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will continue to look at enterprise startups, particularly in New York City, as it looks to distribute these new funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sankaet Pathak co-founded</span><a href="https://synapsefi.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Synapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, he had a vision of doing more than just building a platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that enables banks and fintech companies to easily develop financial services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to build a company that helped provide </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater access</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to financial services to a larger pool of people &#8212; regardless of their net worth or their country of origin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, San Francisco-based Synapse has steadily grown its Deposit Hub, its product that is aimed at making it “faster and easier” for fintech companies to launch and scale foundational financial products to their customers. Synapse’s banking-as-a-service platform provides payment, card issuance, deposit, lending, compliance, credit and investment products as APIs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through those white-labeled developer- and bank-facing APIs, Synapse aims to make it easier for companies to connect with banks, and, in turn, for banks to automate and extend their back-end operations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And that line of its business</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has been doing well. Last year, for example, Synapse doubled its revenue, and this year, so far, it has increased it by 150%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is going a step further and announcing a new platform &#8212; its </span><a href="https://synapsefi.com/credit-hub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a full-stack API platform designed to give fintech companies and neobanks a way to make credit products “easier and smarter” for everyday Americans. The platform is designed to allow any company to build white-labeled credit products — including card issuance, credit-building tools, lending accounts and cashback rewards — in as little as six weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, as Pathak puts it, “We want to democratize credit, so that the credit invisible can build, and get access to, credit.”</span></p>
<p>In private beta until now, the company&#8217;s Credit Hub has so far helped facilitate the issuance of one million<b> </b>credit accounts, and the platform has extended more than $40 million in credit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse is launching its Credit Hub by leveraging the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masterc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network. With the Synapse Credit Hub platform, companies can offer a “comprehensive” suite of products, including card issuance, credit-building tools, accounts and cashback rewards, among other things, Pathak said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no good solution existed for the credit market. Companies would have to piecemeal it together,” Pathak said. “It takes a year or 18 months to take products to market, at a minimum. So we’re taking the same speed we brought to the deposits space to the credit space so developers can democratize credit for everyday Americans and hopefully in the future, globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse was founded in 2014 by Bryan Keltner and Pathak, who came to the U.S. from India to study but grew frustrated at the difficulty of opening a bank account without U.S. social security history. Specifically, as an astrophysics grad student at the University of Memphis, Pathak was denied a bank account that he applied for alongside an American colleague. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even today, Pathak says he &#8212; as CEO and co-founder of a company that in 2019 raised over </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/synapse-raises-33m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$33 million in a Series B funding round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) –– considered himself one of the “credit invisible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty much the American dream is to essentially get a house. But If you&#8217;re a person who is credit invisible, you cannot get a house. I could not get a house in America &#8212; and I&#8217;ve done decently well for myself &#8212; because I&#8217;m an immigrant,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the underbanked doesn’t just include immigrants. It also includes minorities and other populations who have been caught in a cycle of not having access to certain banking services, including credit. He said that the goal is that people with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> little to no financial expertise can take financial services to market. That’s not the case with other providers that require more expertise to get products and services to market, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Synapse Credit Hub, he said, specifically supports a new class of flexible, personalized accounts, cash advances and lines of credit for businesses, and increases access to credit-building and borrowing services for end-users. The platform also gives companies the ability to go to market in as little as six weeks with “out-of-the-box” access to multiple bank partnerships; a full suite of KYC and card issuance features; and a full stack of payment tools, including ACH, checks, wires, bill pay and card processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until now, nobody could provide a comprehensive solution that enables the developer to go live with a feature-rich credit product in just weeks,” Pathak said. “We created Synapse to democratize and drive innovation in fintech, and our Credit Hub operates alongside our deposit products to provide a full-featured digital banking experience.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The various types of credit accounts that can be built using Credit Hub offer different services, such as a credit card, a spend card, buy now, pay later and the ability to issue one-time or revolving loans to enable customers to build credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Synapse shares in Mastercard’s commitment to offering and delivering a frictionless payments experience that is easy to access and always on,&#8221; wrote Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard via e-mail. &#8220;With their Credit Hub platform, Synapse is enabling partners to accelerate the launch of credit products, allowing new solutions to go to market in a matter of weeks instead of months. We’re pleased that Synapse is leveraging the Mastercard network to make credit products more accessible.” </span></p>
