										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/lions-still-on-the-move-growth-in-africas-consumer-sector"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey &amp; Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on general e-commerce activities in Africa says consumer spending will reach over $2 trillion in the next three years. Much of this spending falls under the importation of products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> influenced by consumer demand and the positioning of major e-commerce platforms in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.afrikrea.com/en">Afrikrea</a>, an Ivorian startup founded in 2016, is one of the few platforms facilitating product exports. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised a $6.2 million pre-Series A round while rebranding to ANKA, the SaaS platform it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/ivorian-startup-afrikrea-partners-with-dhl-and-visa-to-launch-saas-e-commerce-platform-anka/">launched for sellers in partnership with DHL and Visa</a> in April last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moulaye-taboure-78280041/">Moulaye Taboure</a> launched Afrikrea with</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/abdoul-kadry-diallo-a7295b73"> Kadry Diallo</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/luc-b-perussault-diallo-99525519"> Luc B. Perussault Diallo</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a marketplace for Africa-based and -inspired fashion, clothing, accessories, arts and crafts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Afrikrea said it served more than 7,000 sellers from 47 African countries and buyers from 170 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some research, the founders noticed that these sellers also engaged with other channels, such as websites or social media. To them, it made sense to build another platform &#8212; <a href="https://www.anka.africa/">ANKA</a> &#8212; where merchants, with an omnichannel dashboard, can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their sales and inventory across all these channels: Afrikrea, social media and websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other features like a customizable online storefront, payment links, and access to various payment methods and logistics added to the platform’s appeal to Afrikrea merchants. The appeal extended to the company itself, resulting in a name change despite the marketplace recording 250% year-on-year growth since launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The main goal behind that is to reflect our much larger purpose and mission now. And also much larger product offering as we are going to serve not only people in fashion but in every industry where anyone wants to export African products,” CEO Taboure told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afrikrea is now one of the features on the ANKA website. Others include a customized online storefront (like Shopify), which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is linked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sellers’ social media platforms and marketplace channels (such as Stripe, Gumroad or PayPal); access to shipping products with DHL; and receiving payments in various currencies (including a buy now, pay later option).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So wherever you sell, on social media, Afrikrea marketplace, or your website, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it ends up in one dashboard,” the CEO said. “You can manage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your orders and one wallet to get paid and withdraw your money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ivorian startup Afrikrea partners with DHL and Visa to launch SaaS e-commerce platform ANKA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/ivorian-startup-afrikrea-partners-with-dhl-and-visa-to-launch-saas-e-commerce-platform-anka/embed/#?secret=SxwHVvb0Z4" data-secret="SxwHVvb0Z4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA is free to use when sellers fill up their product catalogs or generate payment links</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, once sellers decide to start using the software to accept payments or make a sale, they pay €</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 (~$12) to access the service monthly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, sellers pay €</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 (~$12) upfront for the platform’s shipping or website hosting services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taboure told TechCrunch that about 40% of its over 13,000 subscribers do not use the marketplace. To them, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA serves to generate payment links to use on other channels or fulfill orders from other channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company is building out a mobile application to make the process smoother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having engulfed Afrikrea’s merchant base, ANKA has sellers from 47 out of Africa’s 54 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA also mentioned that more than 80% of its sellers are women, who have grown their revenue by 50% on average since joining the ANKA community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also records over 700,000 visits from its buyers who have transacted over $35 million on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, ANKA said these buyers come from 174 countries, the majority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Europe and North America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Taboure, the buyers are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from France and the U.S; they account for 90% of ANKA’s sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past decade, the growth of e-commerce in Africa has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been spearheaded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies like Jumia, Takealot and Mall4Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, MallforAfrica struck a partnership with DHL and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/dhl-launches-africa-eshop-app-for-global-retailers-to-sell-into-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched DHL Africa eShop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the logistics giant four years later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But recent struggles from currency devaluation to investor pullout have forced the startup to <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/11/02/mallforafrica-suspended-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take an extended hiatus</a> (although it claims to be restrategizing), raising fresh questions on the viability of some e-commerce models in Africa. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taboure believes his company is protected from such events because it serves the market the other way round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most e-commerce tried so far has been Africans trying to buy outside. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, when you do that, you have currency and logistics issues that are completely different</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are the opposite. We are trying to have Africans earn in foreign currency. So if I were, to be honest, it’s almost like we operate in two different worlds,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the few startups that are trying not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make Africans spend their money or buy more things. We actually want to help them earn money globally and create value on the global stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this way, we contribute to solidifying our economies in much more than one way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview TechCrunch had with the chief executive last year, he touted ANKA as the largest e-commerce exporter startup on the continent, claiming it ships over 10 tons of cargo per month from Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sorts of numbers make investors’ mouths water &#8212; in ANKA’s case, e-commerce heavyweights like <a href="https://hk.linkedin.com/in/joe-tsai-4a9120102">Joseph Tsai</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alibaba executive and billionaire participated in the round alongside</span> <a href="https://bestseller.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BESTSELLER Foundation</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose chairman is one of the largest shareholders in both ASOS and Zalando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">French VC and Africa-focused impact firm</span><a href="https://www.ietp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Investisseurs &amp; Partenaires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (I&amp;P) led the round. In a statement, its co-CEO, Sebastien Boye, said I&amp;P invested in ANKA because the company is at the heart of his firm’s strategy: talented and ambitious founders, significant growth, value creation and a compelling impact thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include VestedWorld, Enigmo, Groupe Prunay, Rising Tide Africa and SAVIU Ventures, the lead investor in ANKA’s seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/loftyinc-capital-launches-third-fund-at-10m-for-a-more-diverse-portfolio-of-african-startups/">LoftyInc Capital</a> and other local investors back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $8.1 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re pretty happy to have some VCs in the round, but also having entrepreneurs that already did what we did. That’s something that we’re very proud about and very intentional in building the round is we focused on having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the best people at the table to help us grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said the pre-Series A round will help it build out its SaaS mobile infrastructure and further product development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ANKA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also plans to <a href="https://anka.breezy.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire talent</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across tech, finance, sales and marketing to join its 30-person team across four continents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Synthetic data startup MOSTLY raised a $25 million Series B round led by British VC firm Molten Ventures, with participation from new investor Citi Ventures and existing investors 42CAP and Earlybird.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austrian synthetic data startup <a href="https://mostly.ai/">MOSTLY AI</a> today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series B round. British VC firm <a href="https://www.moltenventures.com/">Molten Ventures</a> led the operation, with participation from new investor<a href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/"> Citi Ventures</a>. Two existing investors also returned: Munich-based <a href="https://www.42cap.com/">42CAP</a>, and Berlin-based <a href="https://earlybird.com/">Earlybird</a>, which had led MOSTLY AI&#8217;s <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/03/mostly-ai-raises-5m-in-series-a-funding.html">$5 million Series A round</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Synthetic data is fake data, but not random: MOSTLY AI uses artificial intelligence to achieve a high degree of fidelity to its clients&#8217; databases. Its data sets &#8220;look just as real as a company’s original customer data with just as many details, but without the original personal data points,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>Talking to TechCrunch, MOSTLY AI CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiashann/">Tobias Hann</a> said that the company plans to use the proceeds to push the boundaries of what its product can do, grow its team, and gain more customers both in Europe and in the U.S., where it already has offices in New York City.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255890" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MOSTLY AI was founded in Vienna in 2017, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented across the EU one year later. This demand for privacy-preserving solutions and the concomitant rise of machine learning have created significant momentum for synthetic data. <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/07/24/by-2024-60-of-the-data-used-for-the-development-of-ai-and-analytics-projects-will-be-synthetically-generated/">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2024, 60% of the data used for the de­vel­op­ment of AI and an­a­lyt­ics projects will be syn­thet­i­cally gen­er­ated.</p>
<p>MOSTLY AI&#8217;s typical clients are Fortune 100 banks and insurers, as well as telcos. These three highly regulated sectors drive most of the demand for synthetic tabular data, alongside healthcare.</p>
<p>Unlike some of its competitors, MOSTLY AI hasn&#8217;t put its focus on healthcare in the past, but it could change. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly something that we are watching closely and we are actually starting some pilot projects this year,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>
<p>The democratization of AI means that synthetic data will eventually be used well beyond Fortune 100 companies, Hann told TechCrunch. His company therefore plans to serve smaller organizations and a wider range of sectors in the future. But until now, it made sense for MOSTLY AI to focus on enterprise-level clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the moment, enterprise companies are the ones that have the budgets, need and sophistication to work with synthetic data, Hann said. To match their expectations, MOSTLY AI obtained <a href="https://mostly.ai/news/first-synthetic-data-company-with-iso-certification/">ISO certifications</a>.</p>
<p>Talking to Hann, one thing becomes clear: While the startup has a solid technical footing, it is equally invested in the commercialization of its technology and in the business value it can add for its clients. &#8220;MOSTLY AI is leading this emerging and rapidly-growing space in terms of both customer deployments and expertise,&#8221; Molten Ventures&#8217; investment director Christoph Hornung said.</p>
<p>The need to comply with privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA clearly drives demand for synthetic data, but it&#8217;s not the only factor at play. For instance, demand in Europe is also driven by a wider cultural context; while in the U.S., it also results from a desire to innovate. For instance, use cases can include advanced analytics, predictive algorithms, fraud detection and pricing models – but without data that can be traced back to specific users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many companies are proactively approaching the space because they understand that customers value privacy,&#8221; Hann said. &#8220;These companies understand that they can also gain a competitive advantage when dealing and working with data in a privacy-preserving way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing more U.S. companies wanting to adopt synthetic data in innovative ways is the key reason why MOSTLY AI wants to grow its team in the U.S. But it is also recruiting more generally, both in Vienna and remotely. Its plan is to increase its headcount from 35 to 65 people by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Hann expects 2022 to be &#8220;the year where synthetic data will take off,&#8221; and beyond this year, &#8220;a really strong decade for synthetic data.&#8221; This will be supported by growing demand for responsible AI, articulated around key concepts such as AI fairness and explainability. Synthetic data helps answer these challenges. &#8220;It enables enterprises to augment and de-bias their data sets,&#8221; Hann said.</p>
<p>Machine learning aside, MOSTLY AI sees lots of potential for synthetic data to be leveraged in software testing. Supporting these use cases requires making synthetic data accessible not only to data scientists, but also to software engineers and quality testers. It&#8217;s with them in mind that MOSTLY AI came up a few months ago with version 2.0 of its platform. &#8220;MOSTLY AI 2.0 can be implemented on premise or in a private cloud, and adapts to different data structures of the company using it,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/02/2325471/0/en/MOSTLY-AI-First-to-Bring-Synthetic-Data-to-Software-Testing.html">wrote</a> at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are clearly a B2B software infrastructure company,&#8221; Hann said. Both in its Series A and B rounds, the company looked for investors who understood that approach.</p>
<p>Molten Ventures being a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/why-draper-esprit-doubled-down-on-its-status-as-a-publicly-listed-vc/">publicly listed VC and consequently not subject to typical funding cycles</a> also carried some weight, Hann confirmed when I asked. &#8220;Having this long term commitment from a partner is something that was very appealing to us, because it&#8217;s a little more flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt either that Citi Ventures is the venture arm of Citigroup, and that it is headquartered in the U.S. &#8220;We&#8217;re significantly increasing the team in the U.S., and it&#8217;s always great to also have a U.S.-based investor that can help with network and relationships there,&#8221; Hann said.</p>
<p>With $25 million in new funding and an increased U.S. presence, MOSTLY AI will now have more resources to compete against other companies in its segment of the synthetic data space. These include <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/">Tonic.ai</a>, which raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tonic-ai-raises-35m-series-b-to-help-engineers-create-synthetic-data-sets/">$35 million Series B last September</a>; <a href="https://gretel.ai/">Gretel AI</a>, which disclosed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/gretel-ai-raises-50m-for-a-platform-that-lets-engineers-build-and-use-synthetic-datasets-to-ensure-the-privacy-of-their-actual-data/">$50 million Series B round</a> last October; and <a href="https://hazy.com/blog/2020/01/27/hazy-seed-plus-raise">seed-funded British startup Hazy</a>, as well as players that focus on specific verticals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do see more and more players emerging in the space and in the market in general, so it certainly shows that there&#8217;s a lot of interest there,&#8221; Hann said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest fintech megaround, </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has confirmed that it has raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round that ups its valuation to $12.3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch in October was the first to report that Brex was raising the capital and had achieved decacorn status. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led the financing, which brings the three-year-old San Francisco startup’s total raised to $1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It has gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies. Last April, Brex said it had combined </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit cards, business cash accounts and new spend management and bill pay software “together in a single dashboard” as part of </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called Brex Premium that cost $49 per month. Today, the company is focused on the corporate card product it’s been building since its inception, banking products and expense management products. Or put more simply, it aims to serve as a “financial operating system” for its customers.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest raise follows a year that saw a “more than doubling” of revenue, according to co-CEO and co-founder Henrique </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubugras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declined to reveal hard figures. Existing investors made up about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 95% of those participating in the Series D-2 round, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t open up to new ones because we had so many new investors with deep pockets who we’d promised we’d give more allocation to over the years,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubugras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “They were comfortable that we had hit the targets we said we were going to so that gave us some credibility to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the funding announcement, Brex also announced that it has hired away an exec from Meta: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/_karandeep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karandeep Anand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been named the company’s chief product officer after having led </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta’s business products group, which served more than 200 million businesses globally. Prior to that, Anand spent 15 years at Microsoft, where he led the product management strategy for Microsoft’s Azure cloud and developer platform efforts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exec will lead Brex’s product portfolio expansion efforts, where a good portion of its new capital will be directed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Karandeep is an engineer by background so he is product and engineering-oriented but also business and customer-oriented,” Dubugras told TechCrunch. “He’s a unique hire in that sense, and that’s particularly important for Brex. Our software and card touches most of the employees in a company even though it’s the CFO that decides to buy it. Since we want to provide a consumer-like experience, he’s going to help there.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Anand described Brex as “a market disruptor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opportunity to create economic opportunity for millions of people and businesses globally through innovation in financial products is incredibly exciting,” he said in a written statement. “The opportunity ahead for Brex is expansive, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to create products that will help our customers grow their businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of customers, Brex continues to serve startups or e-commerce companies that might be smaller businesses but with higher growth. As its earlier customers have grown and matured, Brex is now adapting to also serve mid-market to larger businesses which have different financial needs as they grow. This is where it appears Anand will be able to offer the greatest value.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255977" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255977" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255977 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brex</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape for startups clamoring to meet companies’ financial needs seems to increase by the day. One of Brex’s most well-known competitors, Ramp, is also growing impressively and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August, announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $300 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its move to serve larger and more established companies, Brex seems to only be further encroaching into Ramp’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nell Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, believes Brex has been able to build a card that meets the needs of “modern” businesses and startups. And while that alone was compelling enough to attract his firm’s attention, Greenoaks also saw the broader potential for a “truly extensible platform that could solve a universal set of problems,” including providing better controls over employee spend, “painless” expense reporting and rewards tailored to a company’s specific needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The result is a differentiated experience that shows up in attractive customer loyalty, and some of the best growth metrics we’d ever seen,” he wrote via email. “On top of this, we’ve been consistently impressed with Brex’s team, who build excellent products fast, with a profound vision for the future of business banking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta went on to say that Brex has become the “cognitive referent” for modern business banking. He touted features such as instant onboarding and virtual card provisioning; an “easy to use UX”; no account fees; “compelling” rewards; and technology “that’s built to integrate into its customers’ financial workflows.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think few companies can so effectively serve such a diversity of businesses, from day one startups to sophisticated enterprises with complex needs,” he added. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255974" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255974" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255974 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founders2-e1641861691269.jpg?w=680" alt="Brex confirms $12.3B valuation" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255974" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders and co-CEOs Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi / Brex</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Brex has “built all its technology from scratch” is a big differentiator for the company, according to Dubugras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t use third-party legacy vendors like banks do, and we’re pretty specialized on high-growth businesses,” he told TechCrunch. “A lot of competitors have single line products, but with us, you can do your banking, you can do expense management, you can get a venture debt line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by Pedro Franceschi and Dubugras (who are now in their mid-20s), San Francisco-based Brex was valued at $7.4 billion this April after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $425 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global Management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company told TechCrunch at the time of its last raise that it was “onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.” Brex also said then that it grew its “total customer” figure by 80% in the first quarter of 2021, “with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company expects to have 1,000 employees by month’s end. Because it is still focused on growth, it is not yet profitable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has submitted its compliance plans to allow developers to use third-party payment options in South Korea at a reduced service fee, the Korea Communication Commission (KCC) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">KCC also said it would discuss with Apple to iron out further details, including service fee structures and the exact date when the payment option will go into effect. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The announcement comes after the South Korean authorities requested in October for global app store operators like Google and Apple to turn in detailed plans for the country&#8217;s new law, which bans app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple told the KCC in October that it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">already in compliance with</a> the new law in South Korea, while Google <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">has outlined</a> its strategy in November to provide an alternative payment system on its app store in South Korea in a move to follow the new law, dubbed the “Anti Google law&#8221; </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that took effect in September.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Google said in <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">its blog</a> that it would reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example, developers, who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play’s billing system, would pay 11% through Google’s alternative billing system. </span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s top executive in South Korea, Brandon Yoon, who was in charge of the app store system, abruptly left the iPhone maker in early November. According to media reports, Yoon’s leave is not related to the alternative app payment system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In late August 2021, the South Korean parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">has passed</a> the world’s first bill to prevent the global tech giants from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users,” a spokesperson at Apple said.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple said in its statement that the number of app developers operating in South Korea has increased to approximately 580,000, with more than 1.4 million apps available on the Korean App Store since 2008. Through its App Store, Apple has helped Korean developers access markets and customers in nearly 200 countries around the world, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” the spokesperson said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Economies of scale are an essential cornerstone for on-demand companies, and to that end one of the hopefuls in the space has raised a big round to grow its business. <a href="https://bolt.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> &#8212; the startup and app of the same name that operates on-demand ride hailing, shared cars and scooters; and restaurant and grocery delivery &#8212; has raised €628 million ($709 million at current rates), at a valuation of €7.4 billion ($8.4 billion). It will be using the funds to continue expanding to new geographies and to bring more consumers and partners to its &#8220;super app&#8221;; and newer business lines, such as its 15-minute grocery delivery option Bolt Market, will be building out &#8216;dark stores&#8217; in more cities to expand the service beyond the 10 where its active today.</p>
<p class="p12">&#8220;All of our business units are growing,&#8221; founder and CEO Markus Villig said in an interview this week. Villig said that even its most mature business, ride hailing, &#8220;is seeing double digit growth,&#8221; while the newer businesses, being smaller, are expanding even faster. &#8220;The new trend of last year is that private cars are a bad thing and increasingly people want to use other forms of mobility.&#8221; He added that Bolt is working on partnering with more city governments to build out its services as part of their updated transportation strategies.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management and Research Company LLC co-led the round with Whale Rock, Owl Rock (a division of Blue Owl), D1, G Squared, Tekne, Ghisallo, and other unnamed backers also participating.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255548" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding news caps off an eventful few months for the company, which had raised €600 million at a valuation of over €4 billion <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/bolt-closes-a-600m-funding-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only four months earlier</a> in a Series E also led by Sequoia. Bolt now has more than 100 million customers in 45 countries and 400+ cities using its services. As a measure of its growth, in August, when the company announced that previous round, it had 75 million customers.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s growth is also notable considering the difficulties that some of its competitors have been facing in the wake of Covid: first the pandemic had a major chilling effect on people being willing to go into a vehicle where they have to sit in a closed-in space with another person (the driver). That situation was then compounded when things picked up again but so quickly that many services are suffering from a shortage of drivers, not passengers.</p>
<p>Villig admitted that Bolt, too, faced some &#8220;short-term fluctuations&#8221; in demand when the lockdowns first started. But it has made attracting and keeping drivers a major focus by paying out better commissions than its rivals (typically, Villig said, it will pay between 10% and 20% better than competitors).</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a massive lack of supply on these platforms, so we have focused on taking the most partner-friendly lowest commission,&#8221; he said. That has paid off well for Bolt, which has now seen monthly revenues more than double compared to sales pre-Covid, Villig said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bolt was founded eight years ago in Tallinn, Estonia (originally as Taxify), with a mission to bring ride hailing to emerging markets and countries where others like Uber had yet to gain a strong foothold, a strategy that it used to expand modestly across regions like Central and Eastern Europe and Africa, in the process attracting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/chinas-didi-invests-in-taxify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors like China&#8217;s Didi</a> &#8212; itself having built a massive business in its own home emerging market. (Didi <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/08/31/didi-gives-bolt-stake-worth-hundreds-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly divested</a> its stake in Bolt last year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over time, the focus has remained on Europe and Africa, but Bolt found that a lot of its learnings from those first launches could just as easily be applied in more developed countries, with more lucrative payoffs. </span></p>
<p class="p12">&#8220;We started off in Eastern Europe and Africa because those markets had a bigger need. They had lower car ownership, higher unemployment [making for a market with many freelance drivers], It made sense,&#8221; said Villig. &#8220;But now we’ve learned that this model works everywhere, and it’s actually easier to grow in Western Europe because they are developed markets. We found if you can make this model work in really cheap, frugal markets, then once you go to London or Stockholm, it&#8217;s materially easier. And the unit economcis are definitely better because the prices are higher.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a perfect system, though. Working in developed markets, he said, the trade-off is &#8220;more regulations,&#8221; and the limits that come with those.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bolt&#8217;s diversification approach, moving beyond cars to scooters and couriers, and now also food delivery services, is also a part of its scaling strategy. Offering multiple services within a single app not only helps Bolt bring in new customers and cross sell to them, but it does so with essentially zero marketing costs by putting all of the options and cross-promotions within a single app, said Villig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two elements that set us apart and are turning in our favor are the synergies and the shared costs between these verticals,&#8221; he said. Most of Bolt&#8217;s competitors are generally focused on one thing in each app, Villig continued, &#8220;and we are not,&#8221; so it&#8217;s easier and less expensive for Bolt to build more services off the back of each other. &#8220;Now we are passing on those savings for customers.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to deepen our partnership with Markus and Bolt to further their mission to make urban travel affordable, sustainable and safe,&#8221; said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia, in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;At Sequoia, we believe in the global potential for technology and entrepreneurship and have been inspired by Bolt&#8217;s growth from Tallinn, Estonia to over 400 cities and 100 million customers across Europe and Africa. We&#8217;re eager to help them expand their footprint, increase their product offering and improve the quality of life in cities for the long term.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor has sanctioned the European Parliament for a series of breaches of the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules.</p>
<p>The decision sounds a loud warning to sites and services in the region about the need for due diligence of personal data flows and transfers &#8212; including proper scrutiny of any third party providers, plug-ins or other bits of embedded code &#8212; to avoid the risk of costly legal sanction. Although the parliament has avoided a financial penalty this time.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor&#8217;s (EDPS) intervention relates to a COVID-19 test booking website which the European Parliament launched in September 2020 &#8212; using a third party provider, called Ecolog.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The website attracted a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/privacy-complaint-targets-european-parliaments-covid-19-test-booking-site/">complaints</a>, filed by six MEPs, last year &#8212; with the support of the European privacy campaign group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> &#8212; over the presence of third party trackers and confusing cookie consent banners, among a raft of other compliance problems which also included transparency and data access issues.</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the EDPS <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Case%202020-1013%20-%20EDPS%20Decision_bk.pdf">found</a> the parliament was at fault in several respects and it has issued a reprimand &#8212; ordering rectification of any outstanding issues within one month.</p>
<p>The test booking website was found to be dropping cookies associated with Google Analytics and Stripe &#8212; but the parliament failed to demonstrate it had applied any special measures to ensure that any associated personal data transfers to the US would be adequately protected in light of the landmark Schrems II decision by the EU&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>In July 2020, the CJEU struck down the bloc&#8217;s flagship data transfer agreement with the US (aka, the EU-US Privacy Shield) and issued further guidance that transfers of EU people&#8217;s personal data to all third countries must be risk assessed on a case by case basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ruling also made it clear that EU regulators must step in and suspend data flows if they believe people&#8217;s information is at risk. So in order for some transfers to be legal (such as EU-US data flows) additional measures may be needed to raise the level of protection to the required standard of essential equivalence with EU law &#8212; something the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">since issued</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">detailed guidance</a> on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Twv4nukO8J"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/embed/#?secret=Twv4nukO8J" data-secret="Twv4nukO8J" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However &#8212; in the case of the parliament&#8217;s COVID-19 test booking site &#8212; the EDPS found no evidence that it or its provider had applied any such extra measures to safeguard EU-US transfers resulting from the inclusion of Google Analytics and Stripe cookies.</p>
<p>Turns out the provider had copypasted code from another website it had built, for a test centre in the Brussels International Airport &#8212; hence the presence of cookies for payment company Stripe on the parliament site (despite no payments actually being required for testing booked via the website).</p>
<p>Google Analytics cookies, meanwhile, had apparently been included by the provider to &#8220;minimise the risk of spoofing and for website optimisation purposes&#8221;, according to the EDPS&#8217; findings.</p>
<p>Post-<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II</a>, the presence of cookies designed to send data to US-based providers for processing creates immediate legal risk for EU-based websites &#8212; and/or their clients (in this case the parliament was found by the EDPS to be the sole data controller, while Ecolog was the data processor). So incorporating Google Analytics may do the opposite of &#8216;optimizing&#8217; your site&#8217;s compliance with EU data protection law.</p>
<p>That said, enforcement of this particular compliance issue has been a slow burn, even since the 2020 CJEU ruling &#8212; with only a smattering of regulator-led investigations, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">clearest leadership coming from the EDPS itself</a>.</p>
<p>A (very) long running complaint against Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, meanwhile, brought by noyb founder Max Schrems in the wake of the 2013 Snowden disclosures about NSA mass surveillance of social network and Internet data, still hasn&#8217;t resulted in a final decision by its lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) &#8212; despite the latter agreeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/"><em>a full year ago</em> that it would &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize the complaint</a>.</p>
<p>Again, though, that makes the EDPS&#8217; intervention on the parliament complaint all the more significant. tl;dr: EU banhammers are, gradually, falling.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2OeQSwYcpw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=2OeQSwYcpw" data-secret="2OeQSwYcpw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In another finding against the parliament, the EDPS took issue with confusing cookie consent notices shown to visitors to the test booking website &#8212; which it found provided inaccurate information; did not always offer clear choices to reject third party tracking; and included deceptive design which could manipulate consent.</p>
<p>By contrast, EU law on consent as a legal basis to process people&#8217;s data requires is clear that choice must be informed, specific (i.e. purpose limited, rather than bundled) and freely given.</p>
<p>The parliament was also found to have failed to respond adequately to complainants requests for information &#8212; breaching additional legal requirements law which provide Europeans with a suite of access rights related to their personal data.</p>
<p>While the parliament has landed in the embarrassing situation of being reprimanded by the EDPS, it has avoided a fine &#8212; as the regulator only has narrow powers to issue financial penalties which it said these infringements did not trigger.</p>
<p>But the findings of fault by the bloc&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor draw fresh red lines around routine regional use of US-based tools like Google Analytics (or, indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">Facebook Pages</a>) in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Copypasting code with standard analytics calls might seem like a quick win to a website builder &#8212; but not if the entity responsible for safeguarding visitors&#8217; information fails to properly assess EU-based legal risk.</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; reprimand for the parliament thus has wider significant as it looks likely to prefigure a wave of aligned decisions by EU regulators, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/">scores of similar complaints filed by noyb in August 2020 targeting websites across the bloc</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect more rulings on this matter in the next month,&#8221; noyb&#8217;s honorary chairman, Max Schrems, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The fact that the EDPS has taken a clear position is a good sign for other DPAs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; sanction of the parliament over confusing cookie banners also sends a strong signal over what&#8217;s acceptable and what&#8217;s not when it comes to obtaining users&#8217; consent to tracking &#8212; despite confusing dark patterns still being shamefully widespread in the EU.</p>
<p>(For a particularly ironic example of that, see this <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/from-compliance-to-privacy-ux-regulators-come-for-dark-patterns/">blog post by analyst Forrester</a> &#8212; which warns that regulators are coming for &#8220;dark patterns&#8221;, even as the analyst&#8217;s own webpage serves what very much looks like a non-compliant cookie notice given the only obvious button reads &#8220;Accept cookies&#8221; and it takes multiple clicks through sub-menus to find an option to reject tracking cookies, so er&#8230; )</p>
<p>noyb also kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">a major effort targeting this type of cookie non-compliance last year</a> &#8212; which it suggested could lead to it filing up to 10,000 complaints about dubious cookie banners with EU regulators.</p>
<p>Regional regulators are clearly going to have their work cut out to clean up so much infringement &#8212; which in turn may encourage DPAs to coordinate on standardizing enforcements to drive the necessary scale of change.</p>
<p>The EDPS decision adds high level accelerant by sending a clear signal that confusing cookie banners are the same as non-compliant cookie banners from the body responsible for providing EU lawmakers with expert guidance on how to interpret and apply data protection law.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an illustrative snippet from its decision &#8212; which describes a portion of the confusion that hit visitors to the parliament website as they tried to parse the cookie notices at the time of the complaints (tracking cookies have since been removed from the site):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The English version only referred to essential cookies and prompted the user to either click on the ‘accept all’ or the ‘save’ button. The difference between the two buttons was unclear. The French version of the second layer of cookie banner referred both to essential cookies and ‘external media’. These external media cookies included cookies from Facebook, Google Maps, Instagram, OpenStreetMap, Twitter, Vimeo and Youtube. The visitor could also choose between ‘accept all’ or ‘save’. The German version of the second layer of the cookie banner referred to only one ‘external media’ cookie &#8212; Google Maps &#8212; in addition to the essential cookie.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; conclusion was that the cookie banners in all three languages failed to meet the EU standard for consent.</p>
<p>In another sign of the cookie (non)compliance reckoning that&#8217;s now unfolding in the region, some EU regulators have been taking actual action &#8212; such as France&#8217;s CNIL which issued a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/cnil-facebook-google-cookie-consent-eprivacy-breaches/">major slap-down to Google and Facebook last week</a>, announcing fines of $170M and $68M respectively for choosing dark pattern design over clear choices in their cookie consent flows.</p>
<p>The EDPB, which supports DPAs&#8217; enforcement of pan-EU rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, established a task force on the cookie issue <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-establishes-cookie-banner-taskforce_en">last fall</a> &#8212; saying it would &#8220;coordinate the response to complaints concerning cookie banners&#8221; noyb had filed with a number of regional agencies.</p>
<p>Schrems describes that step as a &#8220;good&#8221; development &#8212; but said it is also slowing things down.</p>
<p>Although he suggested the direction of travel is toward a standard that will require a simple yes/no for tracking. (Which will of course mean a firm &#8220;no&#8221; in the vast majority of cases, given how few people like being stalked by ads &#8212; hence the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">UK DPA&#8217;s recent warning to adtech that the end of tracking is nigh</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The CNIL and the EDPS decisions support the view by us that we need to move to fair &#8216;yes or no&#8217; options,&#8221; Schrems told us. &#8220;We expect other authorities to follow this lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about his vintage data flows complaint via-a-vis Facebook&#8217;s EU-US transfers? Is there any sign of Ireland&#8217;s promised &#8220;swift&#8221; resolution to that particular complaint &#8212; which should have led to a DPA order to Facebook to suspend data flows years ago? But has so far only led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order in September 2020</a> that Facebook suspend transfers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always say that each decision is coming any day &#8212; I stopped following these rumors but there is a rumor on this again right now&#8230; &#8221; Schrems said on the DPC, concluding his text with an eyeroll emoji.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vodafone Idea said on Tuesday it is giving the Indian government a 35.8% stake in the company after its board approved conversion of dues and spectrum auction instalments into equity to save the third-largest telecom operator in the country from collapsing.</p>
<p>The operator, a joint venture between the British telecoms group Vodafone and local billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s conglomerate, has been attempting to avoid a collapse for several years after the arrival of Reliance Jio, which undercut the competitors with cheap data and free calls offering.</p>
<p>Vodafone Idea, additionally, owed New Delhi dues of roughly $6.76 billion. Following the conversion into equity, Vodafone Group’s shareholding will be diluted to 28.5% while Aditya Birla Group&#8217;s will shrink to 17.8%. The Indian government will become the largest shareholder in the wireless telecom operator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shares of Vodafone Idea dropped over 19% on the news and was trading at ₹11.9 (16 cents) apiece at 2.30 am local time.</p>
<p>Bharti Airtel, the second largest telecom operator which also owes dues to the government, said last week it won’t be converting the interest on deferred spectrum related payments and government dues into equity. Its shares have largely remained flat today.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes months after the Indian government gave operators more time to pay dues on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/vodafone-idea-shares-tumble-23-after-india-orders-it-to-pay-billions-in-dues/">a two-decade dispute</a> last year. The Indian government and telecom operators have for a decade disputed how gross revenue should be calculated. The government has mandated the license and spectrum fee to be paid by operators as a share of their revenue. Telcos had argued that only core income accrued from use of spectrum should be considered for calculation of adjusted gross revenue.</p>
<p>The rescue plan, nonetheless, was critical to both the telecom operators who have been hurt by the arrival of Jio, run by Asia&#8217;s richest man Mukesh Ambani, which has become the top Indian telecom operator with over 400 million subscribers in just five years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many private phone operators have exited the market, merged with rivals, or filed for bankruptcy in recent years as Jio lured away subscribers. Vodafone Idea hasn&#8217;t reported annual profits since 2017.</p>
<p>Airtel and Vodafone Idea had sought relief on the $14 billion they owe to the government, a plea the Indian Supreme Court rejected last year. Vodafone Idea executives said in September last year that the company was hopeful of successfully raising funds to pay the dues.</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting that Vodafone Idea won’t have to resort to diluting its dues into equity. “With the recent ~20% tariff hikes and Vi having likely tied up the funding for repaying the non-convertible debentures maturing between December 2021 and February 2022, its prospects have improved. In our view, Vi is likely to continue its fund-raising efforts from its promoters and other investors rather than letting the government acquire a significant stake,” brokerage firm IIFL said Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://qonto.com/en">Qonto</a> has raised a $552 million Series D funding round (€486 million). Following this investment, the startup has reached a valuation of $5 billion (€4.4 billion). This is one of the largest rounds in the French tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Qonto is a challenger bank focused on business bank accounts. The startup focuses primarily on small and medium companies as well as freelancers. It currently operates in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com">Tiger Global</a> and <a href="https://www.tcv.com">TCV</a> are leading today’s funding round. With 220,000 clients, Qonto still plans to grow at a rapide pace in the coming years. “Our goal is to reach one million SMEs by 2025,” co-founder and CEO Alexandre Prot told me. “And we know that Tiger and TCV have supported quite a few companies to reach that scale.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some new investors are also participating in the round, such as Alkeon, Eurazeo, KKR, Insight Partners, Exor Seeds, Guillaume Pousaz, Gaingels and Ashley Flucas. Existing investors Valar, Alven, DST Global and Tencent are putting more money on the table as well.</p>
<p>That’s quite a long list of investors and Qonto proves once again that private equity firms are actively looking for late-stage growth rounds in Europe.</p>

<h2>From everyday banking to an all-in-one finance solution</h2>
<p>What’s interesting with Qonto is that it’s a truly European startup. In the U.S., spend management solutions, such as <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com">Ramp</a>, have been massively successful. As The Information’s Kate Clark reported, they want to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/brex-and-ramp-want-to-take-on-amex-first-theyll-fight-each-other">replace American Express</a> and hand out corporate cards to millions of employees in the U.S.</p>
<p>Qonto started out with business bank accounts because that’s the key financial component of European companies. Many companies use their bank accounts directly to move money around. They initiate transfers, share their bank account number (IBAN) to receive a payment and set up direct debits to pay bills.</p>
<p>And Qonto does that really well. You can sign up from a computer and get a local IBAN a few minutes later. After that, you can also order debit cards to pay with your card.</p>
<p>At first, Qonto relied heavily on a third-party banking partner — <a href="https://www.treezor.com">Treezor</a>. The startup then applied to get its own license to become a payment institution. In 2020, Qonto moved all its clients to its in-house core banking system. The company now owns this critical part of the technical stack.</p>
<p>Qonto has expanded beyond the simple bank account. The startup&#8217;s CEO Alexandre Prot defines Qonto as three different products rolled into a single service. In addition to the everyday banking part, it also simplifies bookkeeping and accounting. It can become your spend management solution as well.</p>
<p>On the bookkeeping front, Qonto lets you export or sync with your <a href="https://qonto.com/en/connect">existing accounting solution</a>. This is a fragmented market as each country uses different accounting tools. For instance, you can export your data to Cegid if you’re a French company, you can synchronize with Datev if you’re a German company, etc. Qonto users can also import receipts directly in their Qonto account.</p>
<p>As for spend management, Qonto lets you hand out physical, virtual or one-time cards to employees. Admins can set up different spending limits, an approval workflow and all the usual stuff that you get from a spend management solution. It might not be as feature complete as a dedicated product, such as <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>, but it could be enough for small companies.</p>
<p>For everything else, Qonto partners with other fintech startups. For instance, customers can open a credit line with <a href="https://october.eu">October</a> and borrow €15,000 to €30,000. Customers can also open a savings account with <a href="https://www.cashbee.fr">Cashbee</a> and its banking partner My Money Bank.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255155" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255155" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" class="size-full wp-image-2255155" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qonto-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255155" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qonto</p></div></p>
<h2>A single bank account</h2>
<p>There are 220,000 companies paying for Qonto every month. Pricing ranges from €9 per month for the most basic freelancer account to €249 per month for enterprise accounts. On top of that, some companies pay more to get more cards or when they go above certain limits.</p>
<p>What makes the business model even more lucrative is that a lot of customers just sign up on their own. When they create their company, they use Qonto for the initial capital deposit in order to register the company. Essentially, Qonto combines inbound marketing with the high margins of a SaaS product.</p>
<p>“Around a third of our customers created their companies with us. It’s their first account and the only one that they use,” Alexandre Prot said. “Two-thirds of our customers are companies that existed before they opened an account with us. Roughly half of them close their existing bank account, half of them use Qonto in parallel with one or several accounts.”</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to grow its team from 500 employees to 2,000 people by 2025. Qonto will also invest heavily in its existing markets. “We will be able to invest more than €100 million on each of our markets,” Prot said. While there are still a lot of SMEs that are not using Qonto in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, Qonto also plans to enter new market in 2023.</p>

<p>eFishery’s products include software like eFarm, which lets shrimp farmers monitor their operations and eFisheryKu, which does the same for fish farmers. Its financing products include eFund, which connects fish farmers to financial institutions for products like a pay later service to buy suppliers. It says more than 7,000 farmers have used eFund so far, with total loans approved more than $28 million.</p>
<p>Other products include smart feeders that are now used by more than 30,000 farmers in Indonesia.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There has been a rather fervent acceleration in planned biometric data collection in recent months. If you’re not worried about it, you should be.</p>
<p>In fact, silly as it sounds, try being <em>more</em> worried about it than seems normal. After all, for-profit biometric data collection has undergone an astounding degree of normalization in the last decade. The idea of Apple scanning your fingerprint on a daily basis once sounded startling. Now it’s how we unlock our banking app and our laptop — unless, of course, we do it with our face. It’s gone mainstream.</p>
<p>We embraced FaceID, thumbprint scanning and similar functions specifically because they are convenient. No passcode, no problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255218" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Corporations and businesses saw this, and now convenience is among the two biggest reasons typically given for the adoption of biometric data collection – the other is public safety, which we’ll get to later. Quick biometric scans, we’re told, make things faster and easier.</p>
<p>In a bid to save time, a number of primary schools throughout the U.K. recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/26/conditioning-an-entire-society-the-rise-of-biometric-data-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented facial scanning for lunch payment</a>. Several schools ended up suspending the program after data privacy experts and parents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/18/privacy-fears-as-schools-use-facial-recognition-to-speed-up-lunch-queue-ayrshire-technology-payments-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a>. They argued convenience was not exactly worth the price of the accumulation of an entire database of young children’s faces stored on a server somewhere. And they’re right.</p>
<h2>Music for your ears, palm print for your ticket</h2>
<p>This September, U.S. ticketing company AXS announced a flagship program to use Amazon One palm-print scanners at Red Rocks Amphitheater as an optional alternative to print or mobile concert tickets (<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/14/amazon-palm-scanning-technology-red-rocks-concert-venue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with plans to expand into additional venues in the coming months</a>). The decision was met with <a href="https://www.amazondoesntrock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediate resistance</a> from both privacy experts and musicians, and it was hardly the first flashpoint over biometric data collection within the live music industry.</p>
<p>In 2019, major promoters LiveNation and AEG (which coordinates major festivals such as Coachella) <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/30/ban-facial-recognition-live-events-music-festivals-concerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped back from plans to invest in and implement facial recognition technology at concerts</a> after public outcry from fans and artists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the fight over the use of biometric recognition during live entertainment is far from settled. When the coronavirus pandemic sent professional sports executives who depend on full stadiums back to the drawing board, their new plans often incorporated mass facial recognition. Faces would replace tickets, and this would ostensibly make everyone safer from the virus.</p>
<p>These executives are determined. The Dutch football team AFC Ajax is seeking to reinstall its pilot facial recognition program that was initially halted by data protection regulators. Henk van Raan, the chief innovation officer of Ajax’s home field, Amsterdam ArenA, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facial-recognitions-next-big-play-the-sports-stadium-11596290400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quoted in The Wall Street Journal</a> as saying, “Hopefully we use this coronavirus pandemic to change rules. The coronavirus is a bigger enemy than [any threat to] privacy.”</p>
<p>This is terrible reasoning, as the risks posed to our privacy are in no way mitigated or lessened by our risk to a virus.</p>
<p>In the same article, Shaun Moore, CEO of facial-recognition supplier Trueface, described his conversations with professional sports executives as overwhelmingly concerned with touch points by sidestepping the handing over of credentials, citing the risk of virus transmission while scanning ticket barcodes.</p>
<p>This is a stretch, and you don’t need to be an epidemiologist to call it one. When the main event involves a big crowd of people yelling and cheering next to one another, it’s probably not the momentary masked interaction when an agent scans a ticket that is worth worrying about. As the safety argument falls apart, so does the convenience one. The simple fact is that our lives are not made exponentially and meaningfully better by the replacement of a mobile ticket with our palm print. Those extra five seconds are a moot point.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see van Raan speak so directly about using the pandemic to override privacy protections and concerns. But his reasoning is frightening and flawed.</p>
<p>Yes, the coronavirus is a real threat, but it’s not an “enemy.” It’s not embodied, nor does it have a motive. It’s a virus. It is outside human control. In insurance terms, it’s an “act of God.” And it’s being used to justify something that is very much in human control: The huge uptick in biometric data collection under the guise of public safety or convenience.</p>
<h2>Public safety and free societies</h2>
<p>Public safety is often the cause upon which increased biometric surveillance is foisted. In August, U.S. lawmakers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-bill-seeks-require-anti-drunk-driving-vehicle-tech-2021-08-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a mandate</a> that would require auto manufactures to include passive technology in new cars to prevent drunken drivers from starting vehicles. That “passive” tech could end up being anything from eye-scanning devices and breathalyzers to an infrared sensor that tests BAC levels through the skin.</p>
<p>Sure, this is a seemingly noble cause with a respectable motive. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drunken driving kills nearly 10,000 people per year; the European Commission <a href="https://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/alcohol-related-crashes-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists a similar number for the EU</a>.</p>
<p>But where is all that data going? Where is it being stored? Who is it being sold to, and what do they plan to do with it? The privacy risks are too great.</p>
<p>The pandemic obliterated many of the obstacles standing in the way of the adoption of mass biometric data collection, and the consequences will be disastrous for civil liberties if it’s allowed to continue in this manner. The intensity of surveillance is ramping up in record time, making governments and for-profit corporations privy to that most private minutiae of our lives and bodies.</p>
<p>A mobile ticket is surveillance enough – it announces to the system you’ve entered the venue at an exact time, after all. Don’t fix it if it’s not broken! And don’t add biometric data collection just because you can under the shaky guise of not spreading germs.</p>
<p>Give out as little biometric data as possible, period. It’s not enough to avoid giving your biometric data to Google or Amazon specifically, given those corporations’ abysmal records when it comes to, say, basic human rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p>A smaller company unaffiliated with your typical tech giant might feel like less of a threat, but don’t be fooled. The moment Amazon or Google acquires that company, they acquire your and everyone else’s biometric data with it. And we’re back where we started.</p>
<p>A safe society need not be a heavily surveilled society. We built increasingly safe and healthy societies for centuries without the use of a single video camera. And beyond safety, heavy surveillance that is this detailed and individualized is the death knell of a society that values civil liberties.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what this all comes down to. A free and open society is not without its risks – this is, arguably, one of the major tenets of Western political thought since the Enlightenment. Those risks are far preferable to those of living in a heavily surveilled society.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s no getting off the biometric grid we’re heading toward. The time to stop the slide by regulating and eliminating unnecessary biometric data collection, particularly when for-profit corporations are involved, is now.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CES is still a fantastic car show — but if you work at a hardware startup, it's time to rethink your media strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For fifty-four years, big and small hardware manufacturers that hoped to reach their target audiences rolled out new products at the Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>The first CES event in June 1967 drew 17,500 attendees, where many in the crowd were absolutely dazzled by GE&#8217;s new 24-pound color television. In the intervening decades, the conference grew so much, it essentially created its own gravity. The last in-person CES held in 2020 attracted a total verified attendance of 171,268, according to organizers.</p>
<p>The trade show shifted to online-only in 2021, but CES returned last week, even though many exhibitors and publications (including this one) declined to send representatives, citing the ongoing omicron surge. &#8220;It’s time we return to making the world better rather than living in fear,&#8221; wrote Consumer Trade Association president and CEO Gary Shapiro <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/'">in an opinion column</a>.</p>
<p>But just 40,000 people attended, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/conventions/ces/ces-attendance-down-more-than-75-organizers-say-2509439/">according to the Las Vegas Review Journal</a>. That&#8217;s a 75% decline.</p>
<p>If an event only attracts 25% of its usual crowd, for whom is it essential? Today, TechCrunch Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec, Hardware Editor Brian Heater and reporter Haje Jan Kamps shared their thoughts on CES 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kristin Korosec: CES hasn&#8217;t lost its automotive luster</li>
<li>Brian Heater: Hardware startups should reconsider their media strategies</li>
<li>Haje Jan Kamps: I missed it sorely this year</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Kristin Korosec: CES hasn&#8217;t lost its automotive luster</h2>
<p>Somewhere around 2014 or so, CES turned into a car show. And even with the latest variant of COVID derailing in-person plans for many companies, CES 2022 didn’t lose its automotive luster.</p>
<p>This year was different in a few respects, signaling that the automotive industry has taken a few cupfuls of we-really-need-revenue punch. Technology that is further away from commercialization showed up, but not in the same force as in previous years. CES 2022 was not the year for evtols, hyperloop, and to a lesser degree, autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The weeks following CES have traditionally been a desert for hardware news. Fill that vacuum.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicle technology wasn’t absent from the show, and there were some key announcements and activities. A few of the notable ones included the head-to-head autonomous racecar competition at the Las Vegas Speedway, GM CEO Mary Barra’s intention to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gm-personal-autonomous-vehicles/">sell personal autonomous vehicles</a> by mid-decade (although some key details were missing) and Intel subsidiary Mobileye’s plan to bring a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">supercomputer to market</a> designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers. When automated driving did come up, it was often in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking — or both.The Mobileye announcement points to one of the themes at CES 2022: compute.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The backbone of Indonesia’s economy are its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/how-can-indonesian-smes-scale-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated more than 60 million SMEs</a>. But many lack access to working capital and, especially before the pandemic, managed their finances using manual processes like spreadsheets. With COVID-19 prompting many to digitize, startups that focus on SMEs have been raising large rounds of funding to scale up quickly. <a href="https://koinworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KoinWorks</a> is the latest. The Indonesia-based financial platform for SMEs announced today it has raised $108 million in Series C funding led by MDI Ventures. The round included $43 million in equity and $65 million in debt capital for the working capital loans KoinWorks provides to its customers.</p>
<p>The round brings KoinWorks’ total raised to $180 million. Existing investors who returned for its latest round include Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, ACV and East Ventures. The new funds will be used for hiring about 400 new employees and scaling KoinWorks’ latest suite of products, SME Neobank.</p>
<p>KoinWorks is headquartered in Jakarta, with holding in Singapore and tech offices in Yogyakarta, India and Vietnam. KoinWorks was originally created to help SMEs, which are often turned away by traditional financial institutions, get access to working capital. Since then, it has also developed a comprehensive platform of financial tools to help its customers, including e-commerce vendors and social commerce sellers, increase their sales.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255467" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/koinworks-indonesia-seriesb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first profiled KoinWorks in 2019</a> when it raised $12 million for its lending platform. Demand increased as more businesses went online during the COVID-19 pandemic and the startup says its user base tripled to 1.5 million customers, and a waitlist of 100,000 SMEs who are being onboarded onto its new financial software. Co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin told TechCrunch in an email that since 2019, monthly loan disbursements have also tripled to nearly $50 million and revenue had quadrupled.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspire raises $158M Series B to build a full-stack “financial operating system” for Southeast Asian businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/aspire-raises-158m-series-b-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-operating-system-for-southeast-asian-businesses/embed/#?secret=7Sfl4l7YmL" data-secret="7Sfl4l7YmL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>KoinWorks focuses on SMEs that are underserved by traditional financial institutions and may not have a bank account or credit cards. On the platform, users can create an online bank account and card, borrow working capital, and access point-of-sale, early wage access and human resources management systems tailored for small businesses.</p>
<p>Arifin said that since KoinWorks’ monthly disbursement rate reached $50 million a month, its take rate has grown enough that the company became cash flow positive earlier this year, and its non-performing loan (NPL) percentage is lower than 2%. He says banks serving traditional SMEs have at least double KoinWorks’ NPL. “As many as 20% of businesses shifted their sales channels offline to online during the pandemic, and 89% of businesses now use online channels to sell their products and services,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last three years, Indonesian fintechs focused on SMEs have grown to include other neobanks and startups that started out as accounting software but are expanding to include working capital loans and other financial services. Two notable examples included BukuWarung and BukuKas, both of which have raised significant rounds of funding (and are KoinWorks collaborators) and neobank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/aspire-raises-158m-series-b-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-operating-system-for-southeast-asian-businesses/">Aspire</a>.</p>

<p>“When we started out, we were among hundreds of traditional financial institutions. Fast forward to the present day, we are seeing those same banks now undergo digitalization,” Arifin said. “Despite that, Indonesia’s yearly funding gap is $80 billion USD, so those who remain unbanked or underbanked are still at a disadvantage. There’s still a lot of room for improvement”</p>
<p>He added that with tens of millions of entrepreneurs in Indonesia, “it’s not a winner-takes-all market.” The top five banks in the country have a combined market value of close to $160 billion USD. There will undoubtedly be fintech companies out there tackling the unbanked/underbanked space, however, KoinWorks has a best in class approach tailored to the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs that we believe will have a significant impact on the future sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dallas council members will vote Wednesday on whether to approve an economic development agreement with Ford in the hopes of being home to the automaker&#8217;s next autonomous vehicle facility, reported <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos/2022/01/10/dallas-is-a-finalist-for-160-million-ford-and-argo-ai-self-driving-vehicle-facility/">The Dallas Morning News</a>.</p>
<p>Ford, an investor and customer of AV technology company Argo AI, is working with Argo to commercialize the self-driving technology. The two companies have established three test vehicle depots in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C. in a run up to its commercialization plans. The facility in Dallas, if the location is ultimately chosen by Ford, would be similar to those operations. (Argo also has its own test fleets and facilities in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Palo Alto).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">The two companies plan to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on ride-hailing company Lyft&#8217;s app in a number of cities over the next five years, beginning with Miami and Austin.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255962" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the agenda item passes with Dallas&#8217;s Office of Economic Development, Ford might be looking at over $3 million in proposed tax breaks over the span of five years. The city would also commit a $250,000 grant toward the construction of the facility, which is proposed to be located at a 32,361-square-foot space at 2335 Burbank Street. To meet its end of the bargain, Ford would need to create a minimum of 250 new jobs and invest a minimum of $160 million, including the AV fleet, at the property.</p>
<p>The Dallas site is one of three final locations that Ford is scouting for its new AV facility, <a href="https://cityofdallas.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5375649&amp;GUID=F010CA62-4C89-4390-8305-50215E0DB6DA&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to city documents</a>. The other two are in California, where Ford&#8217;s AV unit already has a presence. However, Ford might see the benefits of building in Texas, a state that doesn&#8217;t require permits to operate driverless autonomous vehicles. California, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires separate permits</a> for testing with a driver, testing without a driver, commercial autonomous delivery deployment and commercial robotaxi deployment.</p>
<p>Ford would not comment on the Dallas City Council&#8217;s agenda item, saying it has not made any decisions or chosen any additional cities to expand to, and that &#8220;this is all preliminary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ford is building its self-driving business for ride-hailing and goods delivery in Austin, Texas, Miami and Washington, D.C., and focused on building a profitable self-driving business,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch. &#8220;Scaling this technology is key, driving us to explore a variety of cities in the U.S. to expand our self-driving services. We will share more information about our self-driving business in the future.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle maker Rivian filed a <a href="https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:a7tkzo.2.1">new trademark</a> for bicycles and electric bikes, as well as their corresponding structural parts. The move might signal that Rivian is considering getting on the e-bike demand train and diversifying its portfolio with a product that is cheaper to produce at scale than electric pickup trucks and in line with its targeted &#8220;adventure&#8221; seeking demographic.</p>
<p>Rivian told TechCrunch it had nothing to share on the matter.</p>
<p>Companies often file trademarks for products they don&#8217;t end up using, but other automakers are beginning to see the value in the e-bike industry that saw a <a href="https://www.npd.com/news/blog/2021/the-cycling-market-pedals-ahead-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth rate in sales of 240%</a> over the 12 months leading up to July. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/porsche-unveils-two-new-electric-bikes-alongside-the-taycan-gran-turismo/">Porsche launched two new e-bikes that were designed with the spirit of the Taycan Cross Turismo</a>. BMW has also released plans to produce <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/06/bmw-unveils-high-speed-electric-bicycle-with-300-km-of-range-plus-an-electric-motorcycle/">several e-bikes</a> and other micromobility vehicles lately, as well, like its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/how-bmw-plans-to-corner-the-u-s-scooter-market-with-its-all-electric-ce-04/">all-electric CE 04 scooter</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Last month, Rivian shared plans to use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it went public to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/rivian-to-invest-ipo-wealth-into-new-georgia-factory-battery-tech/">build a second factory in Georgia</a> (its first is in Illinois) to double its production capacity and produce battery cells – cells which can ostensibly be used in batteries for other types of vehicles, as well.</p>
<p>According to the filing, which was first revealed by <a href="https://www.rivianforums.com/forum/threads/rivian-e-bike-aspirations-revealed-by-trademark-filing.3328/">Rivian Forums</a>, Rivian wants to expand the use of its trademark to include the following:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. electric automaker Rivian reported Monday it produced 1,015 vehicles in 2021 — a figure that is in line with expectations that the company lowered last month.</p>
<p>Rivian delivered 920 vehicles by the end of 2021, according to a release issued Monday. The production and delivery numbers combined with a WSJ report that Rivian&#8217;s COO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivians-chief-operating-officer-departed-amid-production-ramp-up-11641849820">left the company</a> last month sent shares down. Rivian shares closed 5.6% lower Monday to $81.44; shares fell another 3.3% in after market trading.</p>
<p>Rivian has more than 71,000 &#8220;pre-orders&#8221; (meaning refundable reservations) for its R1T pickup trucks, according to its <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/3BYl8sLO3rzD9lluEwvXGE/754d4115dc0715d7e95e848556fc93cb/Rivian-Q3-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to shareholders</a> posted in December.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rivian had initially targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by the end of the year. Last month, company executives including CEO RJ Scaringe cut those expectations, saying it would likely fall a few hundred vehicles short due to supply chain issues and challenges of battery production.</p>
<p>During its earnings call in December, Scaringe referred to production as a complex orchestra on two occasions.</p>
<p>&#8220;In ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;So you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite that lowered target, Scaringe noted during that call that the company is &#8220;ramping largely as expected.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line,&#8221; he said in December. &#8220;And as I said, that doesn&#8217;t represent any long-term challenges for us. We have a second line that&#8217;s coming on that will put the battery module production way out in front in terms of capacity of the other areas of the plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rivian races to ramp production, established automakers GM and Ford are preparing to launch their own electric pickup trucks. Ford said January 4 it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/ford-double-production-lightning-pickup/">nearly double production capacity</a> of its upcoming electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 150,000 vehicles a year by mid-2023 in response to customer demand. The first deliveries of F-150 Lightning pickup trucks are expected in spring 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of the popular encrypted communications app Signal, announced today in a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that he is stepping down in a move that he says has been in the works for several months.</p>
<p>While unexpected, the move seems tied in some way to the rise of <a href="https://mobilecoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MobileCoin</a>, a cryptocurrency startup that counts Marlinspike as its earliest technical advisor.</p>
<p>Last spring, eight-year-old Signal, which has more than 40 million monthly users, began testing out an integration with MobileCoin, which says it&#8217;s focused on enabling privacy-protecting payments made through “near instantaneous transactions” over one’s phone. But as Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last week</a>, a &#8220;much broader phase of that experiment has quietly been underway since mid-November. That&#8217;s when Signal made the same feature accessible to all of its users without fanfare, offering the ability to send digital payments far more private than a credit card transaction—or a Bitcoin transfer—to many millions of phones.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255851" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard told the outlet that the rollout has spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, telling Wired that &#8220;there are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, one needs to load one&#8217;s wallet with the cryptocurrency first, and, as Wired notes, it is listed for sale on only a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges, including FTX, and none yet offer it to U.S. consumers. (FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is one of many investors in MobileCoin through his quantitative trading firm and cryptocurrency liquidity provider, Alameda Research.)</p>
<p>Even Americans will have access to the currency shortly, however, Goldbard told Wired, pointing to recently signed agreements, including with the cryptocurrency payment processor <a href="https://zerohash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hash</a>, that should allow U.S. residents buy MobileCoin within the first few months of this year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="haftyrfcdu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/mobilecoin-closes-on-66-million-in-equity-in-series-b-round/">MobileCoin closes on $66 million in equity in Series B round</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MobileCoin closes on $66 million in equity in Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/mobilecoin-closes-on-66-million-in-equity-in-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=haftyrfcdu" data-secret="haftyrfcdu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the meantime, going worldwide has been good for MobileCoin, which last summer raised $66 million in Series B funding at a $1.066 billion valuation and, according to sources close to the company, is in the process of raising a Series C round at a valuation that one source describes as &#8220;in the high single-digit billions&#8221; of dollars.</p>
<p>MobileCoin&#8217;s growth has also raised questions about Signal and about Marlinspike, who has seemingly tried to maintain some distance between himself and MobileCoin. One apparent reason why centers on Signal employees, some of who told reporter Casey Newton last year that they viewed Signal&#8217;s exploration of cryptocurrency as <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-the-battle-inside-signal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risky</a> and an invitation for bad actors to use the platform.</p>
<p>A potentially bigger, but related, concern of critics is that integrating a privacy coin could cause legal headaches for Signal. As Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, told Wired last week, &#8220;I&#8217;m very nervous they&#8217;re going to get themselves into a problematic situation by flirting with this kind of payment infrastructure when there&#8217;s so much legislation and regulation around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a valid concern. As we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/">noted  previously</a>, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven’t historically mixed well owing to nervous regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company. Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal — it claims more than 500 million monthly active users — similarly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned plans</a> to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC.</p>
<p>Even Facebook hasn&#8217;t been able to gain much traction with its own cryptocurrency project, with the longtime leader of that effort, David Marcus, announcing back in November that he was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810220/facebook-crypto-david-marcus-novi-diem-meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the company</a>.</p>
<p>If Marcus shows up at MobileCoin, we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, but we&#8217;d be even less surprised to see Marlinspike get more involved in some capacity. Or not.</p>
<p>Neither Goldbard nor Marlinspike has responded to our requests today for more information. Asked if Marlinspike might consider taking over MobileCoin as CEO (the company does not have one), a source close to him says he is &#8220;not doing that&#8221; and that is he is right now just &#8220;taking a break.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Signal, Marlinspike writes in his post that he will remain on its board while Signal&#8217;s search for a new CEO continues. Its executive chair, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, will serve as Signal&#8217;s interim CEO in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer car-sharing startup Turo has released its filing to become a publicly traded company in the United States, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/car-sharing-startup-turo-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">a process the company began confidentially in August</a>.</p>
<p>The S-1 document filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not include terms for its offering.</p>
<p>Turo, which was founded in 2010 and has been compared to Airbnb for cars, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup&#8217;s website or app. The company boasts 85,000 active hosts and 160,000 active vehicle listings in over 7,500 cities as of September 30, 2021. Car owners get the chance to offset ownership costs, and users get the benefit of affordable short-term rentals at a time when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=increase+in+rental+car+prices&amp;oq=increase+in+rental+car+prices&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i65l2j69i61.2423j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">rental car prices are increasing due to pandemic-induced supply chain issues</a>. Challenges in the traditional car rental industry have certainly allowed Turo to gain some market share, despite steep competition, but that popularity has come with a cost at times, a reading of the risk factors portion of the S-1 shows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Quick financial breakdown</h2>
<p>First let&#8217;s take a look at the financials.</p>
<p>In 2020, Turo generated net revenue of $149.9 million in 2020, a 6% growth from the previous year, according to the S-1. Net losses were $97.1 million in 2020, a slight improvement from the $98.6 million in net losses it had in 2019.</p>
<p>Turo points to a couple of drivers of its revenue growth, notably a digital tool called the Turo Risk Score. This feature, which launched in April 2020, dynamically adjusts the fees that Turo charges guests to complete a booking. Turo said this tool, along with hosts increasing the prices for vehicles that they charge to guests, contributed to its increased net revenue.</p>
<p>In 2021, sales and losses skyrocketed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turo says it generated $330.5 million in net revenue in the first nine months of 2021, a whopping 207% increase from $107.8 million for the same period in 2020. Its net losses also expanded as well. Turo reported a net loss of $129.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>The reason? Turo notes in its S-1 that revenue increased as the number of days booked rose along with gross booking value per day.</p>
<p>Scanning the S-1, it also appears that Turo tried to do more with less in 2020 and has since turned the financial faucet back on this year. The company tightened its spending in 2020 with operating expenses dropping from $133.9 million in 2019 to $95.8 million in 2020.</p>
<p>The first nine months of 2021 tell a different story. The company&#8217;s operating expenses in the first nine months of the year were $124.01 million compared to $71.6 million during the same period last year. Turo also says it hit adjusted EBITDA — a modified profitability metric  — of $69.8 million in the first nine months of 2021. It achieved that in spite of that $129 million net loss because of a $174.7 million change in the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.</p>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>Risk factors facing the company include the obvious &#8220;what if people don&#8217;t use Turo&#8221; and &#8220;we face competition&#8221; from similar apps and traditional car rental companies. But a few others stick out.</p>
<p>For one, Turo notes that the COVID-19 pandemic added volatility to its business. The company was forced to layoff staff and even closed its operations in Germany in 2020, only to have the business come roaring back to &#8220;above pre-Covid levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car rental app notes it may face liability for criminal activities of its hosts. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any lawsuits or fines, yet but in August last year, <a href="https://www.kvoa.com/news/n4t-investigators-peer-to-peer-car-rentals-being-used-for-human-smuggling-a-growing-trend/article_ec4477e4-5c73-11ec-8715-8701a56cffa4.html">Turo and other peer-to-peer rental apps were found to have been used by criminals for human trafficking</a> and other crimes, a trend that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection admits is a growing trend near the border.</p>
<p>Turo is also liable for lawsuits from cities — or more specifically airport authorities — that would require the long-time startup to obtain rental car permits. And in this area, Turo has in fact been sued and countersued. There have been four lawsuits regarding airport use and three of them, including one initiated by Turo versus the City of Los Angeles, have yet to be settled.</p>
<h2>Opportunities and growth</h2>
<p>Despite potential risks, Turo estimates its current serviceable addressable market to be $146 billion and its total addressable market to be $230 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that our $230 billion TAM includes $134 billion in North America, $65 billion in Europe, and $31 billion in the rest of the world (which consists of selected countries in which we believe we have a medium- to long-term opportunity to onboard hosts),&#8221; according to the filing.</p>
<p>Notably, the company appears to be ready to expand its operations within its home U.S. market as well as internationally. It also is ready to make some strategic acquisitions and partnerships &#8220;to offer our hosts and guests services and features that we do not currently offer in-house.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 10, 2022! For those of you sad that it’s winter, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bitcoin-slips-under-the-40000-mark/">bummed that bitcoin took hits today</a>, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don’t frown; it’s going to be OK! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">Y Combinator boosts investment terms</a>: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it’s your move.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/take-two-to-acquire-mobile-gaming-giant-zynga-for-12-7b/">Take-Two buys Zynga</a>: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two’s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/">Career Karma lands $40M</a>: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the “world’s largest staffing firm,” its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has the story.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/startup-fundraising-again-sets-records-as-public-markets-slash-tech-valuations/">want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market</a>. In short, we’re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/who-watches-the-watchers/">Who watches the watchers</a>? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/with-funding-from-top-investors-gameto-is-aiming-to-delay-even-eradicate-menopause/">Gameto is taking on menopause</a>: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to “solve the problem of ‘accelerated’ ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women’s health and equality,” Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it’s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/parrot-a-tool-for-digitizing-mexicos-restaurants-takes-in-9-5m/">Parrot wants to help Mexico’s restaurants thrive in the delivery era</a>: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to “digitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,” we write.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/arive-raises-20m-for-an-instant-delivery-service-beyond-groceries-and-essentials/">Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics</a>: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That’s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/">ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa</a>: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash – a great startup name – raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C</a>: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup “operates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,” we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.</li>

<p>If you’ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it’s easy to see why there’s so much interest in lab-grown meat.</p>
<p>Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience. With consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.</p>
<p>In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+, reporter Christine Hall examines the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identifies many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with related challenges regarding production, cost and consumer interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>SpaceX flies its first rocket in 2022</h2>
<p>Before the first week of the year was even out, Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 with 49 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 6, marking its first flight of the year. The company appears to be planning to keep up a quick clip when it comes to the pace of Falcon 9 flights in 2022, as it&#8217;s readying for a rideshare mission as early as January 13, and another three missions planned before even the end of the month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255700" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s also making progress on its preparations for the first orbital test launch of its Starship vehicle, with a test of its <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1480326831031173124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1480326831031173124%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Fspacex-launch-tower-arms-starship-lift-simulation%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch tower this week</a> that showed how the tower&#8217;s robotic arms would operate in hefting Starship atop the Super Heavy booster that will provide it with the power to get to space. Depending on approvals, SpaceX could be ready to actually make use of that tower for an orbital test sometime around March.</p>

<h2>NASA&#8217;s new space telescope is all set up</h2>
<p>NASA&#8217;s James Webb space telescope, which should provide more detailed and distant imaging of galaxies beyond our own than ever before, has competed its final set of deployments, meaning all the parts that were supposed to unfurl and set themselves up post-launch have successfully done so.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got to have the NASA scientists who&#8217;ve been working on Webb breathing a sigh of relief. The telescope now just has to complete some mid-flight thruster burns in order to place it in the planned and correct orbit, and then it&#8217;ll be ready to snap some photos and send them back for study.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Starlink&#8217;s India woes</h2>
<p>Starlink ran into regulatory problems in India after it set up its own subsidiary to operate in the country. The company had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/spacex-starlink-to-refund-india-government-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refund preorders after the government ordered them to stop providing satellite connectivity</a> in the country without a valid license to do so. Elon Musk has previously been relatively brazen about his view that Starlink doesn&#8217;t necessarily need a license to operate in some global markets.</p>
<p>Shortly after news of the refunds came out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/starlink-india-head-steps-down-after-government-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starlink India&#8217;s lead Sanjay Bhargava announced he&#8217;d be stepping down</a>.</p>
<h2>Other news from TC and beyond</h2>
<p>President Biden nominated <a href="https://twitter.com/Sandra_I_Erwin/status/1480593336863965186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vice Admiral Frank Whitworth</a> as the next director of the <strong>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency</strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Katherine Calvin named chief scientist and senior climate advisor for <strong>NASA</strong>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Understanding the health of your business starts with customer focus: Are you providing breakthrough value to your customers? Is it value that’s so far above and beyond other solutions that it’s worth a prospective customer’s time and effort to switch to you? Is it value that’s so clearly and increasingly a step ahead that they won’t consider other solutions?</p>
<p>That’s what matters most and what drives long-term growth.</p>
<p>Now, how do you measure that success and growth? You need to go beyond surface-level figures: You need to know the metrics that tell you what’s happening in every aspect of your business — the ones deeper than just your averages. Averages lie and can be dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario: If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar with 100 people, suddenly, on average, the net worth of each individual in that bar is over a billion dollars. Is that useful? Would that lead you to take the right actions? No — averages hide true insights.</p>
<p>It’s convenient to focus only on your overall metrics and averages, like revenue and growth, especially when they look great, and even getting a little more sophisticated — looking at revenue and revenue growth by product, customer segment or geography — still paints an incomplete picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We experienced this at Intercom, where segmented metrics looked good, yet there were hidden insights that would have held us back if we hadn’t found them and made deliberate changes.</p>
<h2>Time for a checkup: Diagnosing your revenue health</h2>
<p>So what deeper insights do you need to look for, and how do you find them? One of the most useful metrics you can look at for deeper insights is your revenue health by segment.</p>
<p>Every business tracks and reports on total revenue, but you also need to understand the health of your revenue. Revenue health is one way to look at the ongoing value that you are delivering to your customers, in addition to metrics like Net Promoter Scores.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hidden insights &#8230; would have held us back if we hadn’t found them and made deliberate changes. quote							<cite>Karen Peacock</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>If you’re a SaaS business, you track and report on your annual recurring revenue, and the best ways to measure your revenue health are gross revenue retention (GRR) and net revenue retention (NRR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gross revenue retention is your ability to retain customers and revenue from those customers. You calculate GRR by taking your total revenue at the start of the period, minus revenue churn during the period, and minus revenue contractions during the period (customers who stay with you, but pay you less) — then divide that all by total revenue at the start of the period.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
