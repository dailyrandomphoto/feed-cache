										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://trypico.com">Pico</a>, a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data, <a href="https://trypico.com/blog/company/2-0">announced today</a> that it has launched an upgraded platform and raised $6.5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>In a statement, the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Nick Chen said Pico helps creators with their two biggest problems — &#8220;how to make money more easily and how to get to know your audience better&#8221; — while also giving them control over their two most important assets, namely &#8220;your brand and the relationship to your audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company provides a long list of different tools, including landing pages, pop-ups to collect email addresses, paid newsletters, subscription paywalls, tiered membership programs, recurring and one-time donations and video revenue tools. With version 2.0, the company says it&#8217;s bringing all these features together with a unified data structure, so that customers can see &#8220;who is paying for what content and where they came from&#8221; in one dashboard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Via email, co-founder and President Jason Bade (pictured above with Chen) pointed to &#8220;the power of our CRM to help creators understand their audience&#8221; as the most significant upgrade, suggesting that this &#8220;makes Pico the operating system for the creator economy.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138791" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138791" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2138791" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?w=680" alt="Pico" width="680" height="553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=768,624 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=680,553 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=1536,1248 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=2048,1664 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138791" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pico</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;A creator can’t scale a business without the proper tools,&#8221; Bade continued. &#8220;Take email capture, that is the first step in audience development. But what next? You need data and a CRM to handle it. 2.0 upgrades every part of Pico to rearchitect it for the scalability and extensibility that the creator economy demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pico also it will be launching an API soon to support integrations with different parts of the platform.</p>
<p>Apparently, the company has seen its customer count increase nearly 5x in the past year, with customers including The Colorado Sun, Defector Media and The Generalist. And it recently recruited Rodolphe Ködderitzsch (who held a number of roles at YouTube, including global head of partner sales) as its chief revenue officer.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by Ann Lai at Bullpen Capital and brings Pico&#8217;s total funding to $10 million. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/stripe-and-precursor-lead-4-5m-seed-into-media-crm-startup-pico/">Other investors</a> include Precursor Ventures, Stripe, BloombergBeta and Village Global.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/orchard/">Orchard</a>, founded in 2017, was relatively early to the proptech industry. The company, originally called Perch, focused on dual-trackers, which are folks who are both buying and selling a home simultaneously. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/firstmark-capital/">FirstMark Capital</a> led both the Series A and the Series B funding rounds for Orchard, doubling down on the real estate platform.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have FirstMark Capital Managing Partner Rick Heitzmann and Orchard CEO Court Cunningham join us on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>. The event takes place on <strong>May 5 at 3pm ET/noon PT</strong>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">Register here.</a></p>
<p>Orchard has raised more than $350 million, including a $200 miilion+ debt financing. Alongside running a full brokerage company for dual-tracking home buyers and sellers, it also offers title and mortgage services. But what&#8217;s most interesting about the vertically integrated company is the innovation it&#8217;s doing around the consumer experience. Namely, Orchard is taking an entirely new approach to home searching, which has been incredibly stagnant despite the rush to digitize the process by major tech players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orchard allows consumers to get ML-driven recommendations based on homes they&#8217;ve already liked, and search by different rooms in the house. For example, perhaps the backyard or the kitchen is the most important part of the house &#8212; Orchard lets you default to that pic when browsing listings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rick Heitzmann founded FirstMark Capital all the way back in 2008. He&#8217;s led investments in companies including Pinterest, Airbnb, StubHub, Tapad, DraftKings, Riot Games, Ro, Discord, Carta and more.</p>
<p>On Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll talk more about what Heitzmann looks for in a founder, what he sees in Cunningham and the future of proptech, why Cunningham chose FirstMark and even take a walk through Orchard&#8217;s early pitch deck.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at pitch decks submitted by the audience, giving you the chance to hear directly from a founder and investor how they consume funding decks, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you want to submit your deck to be featured in a future episode of ECL, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a blast.</p>
<p>As a reminder, anyone can attend Extra Crunch Live, but on-demand access to the content is reserved strictly for Extra Crunch members. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">You can join Extra Crunch here.</a></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In business today, many believe that consumer privacy and business results are mutually exclusive — to excel in one area is to lack in the other. Consumer privacy is seen by many in the technology industry as an area to be managed.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the companies who champion privacy will be better positioned to win in all areas. This is especially true as the digital industry continues to undergo tectonic shifts in privacy — both in government regulation and browser updates.</p>
<p>By the end of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">2022</a>, all major browsers will have phased out third-party cookies — the tracking codes placed on a visitor’s computer generated by another website other than your own. Additionally, mobile device makers are limiting identifiers allowed on their devices and applications. Across industry verticals, the global enterprise ecosystem now faces a critical moment in which digital advertising will be forever changed.</p>
<p>Up until now, consumers have enjoyed a mostly free internet experience, but as publishers adjust to a cookie-less world, they could see more paywalls and less free content.</p>
<p>They may also see a decrease in the creation of new free apps, mobile gaming, and other ad-supported content unless businesses find new ways to authenticate users and maintain a value exchange of free content for personalized advertising.</p>
<p>When consumers authenticate themselves to brands and sites, they create revenue streams for publishers as well as the opportunity to receive discounts, first-looks, and other specially tailored experiences from brands.</p>
<p>To protect consumer data, companies need to architect internal systems around data custodianship versus acting from a sense of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/ccpa-wont-be-enough-to-fix-techs-data-entitlement-problem/">data entitlement</a>. While this is a challenging and massive ongoing evolution, the benefits of starting now are enormous.</p>
<p>Putting privacy front and center creates a sustainable digital ecosystem that enables better advertising and drives business results. There are four steps to consider when building for tomorrow’s privacy-centric world:</p>
<h2>Transparency is key</h2>
<p>As we collectively look to redesign how companies interact with and think about consumers, we should first recognize that putting people first means putting transparency first. When people trust a brand or publishers&#8217; intentions, they are more willing to share their data and identity.</p>
<p>This process, where consumers authenticate themselves — or actively share their phone number, email or other form of identity — in exchange for free content or another form of value, allows brands and publishers to get closer to them.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dell.com">Dell</a> announced this afternoon that it&#8217;s spinning out <a href="http://vmware.com">VMware</a>, a move that has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">suspected for some time</a>. Dell, acquired VMware as part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">massive $58 billion EMC acquisition</a> (announced as $67 billion) in 2015.</p>
<p>The way that the deal works is that Dell plans to offer VMware shareholders a special dividend of between $11.5 and 12 billion. As Dell owns approximately 81% of those shares that would work out to somewhere between $9.3 and $9.7 billion coming into Dell&#8217;s coffers when the deal closes later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;By spinning off VMware, we expect to drive additional growth opportunities for Dell Technologies as well as VMware, and unlock significant value for stakeholders. Both companies will remain important partners, with a differentiated advantage in how we bring solutions to customers,&#8221; Dell CEO Michael Dell said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xU51XhBYOA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">$67 billion Dell-EMC deal closes today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$67 billion Dell-EMC deal closes today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/embed/#?secret=xU51XhBYOA" data-secret="xU51XhBYOA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While there is a fair amount of CEO speak in that statement, it appears to mean that the move is mostly administrative as the companies will continue to work closely together, even after the spin off is official. Dell will remain as chairman of both companies.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/09096f9a-3f71-4059-b7bb-8c38b6a25904">a presentation to investors</a>, the companies indicated that the plan to work together is more than lip service. There is a five year deal commercial agreement in place with plans to revisit that deal each year thereafter. In addition, there is a plan to sell VMware products through Dell sales team and for VMware to continue to work with Dell Financial Services. Finally, there is a formalized governance process in place related to achieving the commercial goals under the agreement, so it&#8217;s pretty firm that these companies will continue to work closely together at least for another five years.</p>
<p>For its part, VMware said in a <a href="https://ir.vmware.com/download/companies/vmware/Presentations/VMware%20and%20Dell%20Technologies%20Reach%20Agreement%20Regarding%20Spin-off.pdf">separate release</a> that the deal will allow it &#8220;increased freedom to execute its strategy, a simplified capital structure and governance model and additional strategic, operational and financial flexibility, while maintaining the strength of the two companies’ strategic partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dell shares are up more than 8% following the announcement. The company intends on using parts of its proceeds to deleverage, writing in a release that it will use &#8220;net proceeds to pay down debt, positioning the company well for Investment Grade ratings.&#8221; By that it means that Dell will reduce its net debt position and, it hopes, garner a stronger credit rating that will limit its future borrowing costs.</p>
<p>Even when it was part of EMC, VMware had a special status in that it operates as a separate entity with its own executive team, board of directors and the stock has been sold separately as well.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close at the end of this year, but it has to clear a number of regulatory hurdles first. That includes garnering a favorable ruling from the IRS that the deal qualifies for a tax-free spin-off, which could prove to be a considerable hurdle for a deal like this.</p>
<p>The transaction is not a surprise. The company has been open about its intention to shake up its broader corporate structure. And with Dell bloated in debt terms and, perhaps, in product scope as well, the VMware deal could be an intelligent way forward. Dell investors are more excited about the transaction than VMware shareholders, with the latter company&#8217;s stock up a more modest 1.4%.</p>
<p>VMware&#8217;s most recent earnings release notes that it had $4.715 billion in &#8220;total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.&#8221; Perhaps its shareholders aren&#8217;t enthused at the prospect of levering VMware&#8217;s balance sheet to help Dell do the opposite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/mercato-raises-26m-series-a-to-help-smaller-grocers-compete-online/">online grocery delivery startup Mercato</a> exposed tens of thousands of customer orders, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>A person with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that the incident happened in January after one of the company&#8217;s cloud storage buckets, hosted on Amazon&#8217;s cloud, was left open and unprotected.</p>
<p>The company fixed the data spill, but has not yet alerted its customers.</p>
<p>Mercato was founded in 2015 and helps over a thousand smaller grocers and specialty food stores get online for pickup or delivery, without having to sign up for delivery services like Instacart or Amazon Fresh. Mercato operates in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, where the company is headquartered.</p>
<p>TechCrunch obtained a copy of the exposed data and verified a portion of the records by matching names and addresses against known existing accounts and public records. The data set contained more than 70,000 orders dating between September 2015 and November 2019, and included customer names and email addresses, home addresses, and order details. Each record also had the user&#8217;s IP address of the device they used to place the order.</p>
<p>The data set also included the personal data and order details of company executives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how the security lapse happened since storage buckets on Amazon&#8217;s cloud are private by default, or when the company learned of the exposure.</p>
<p>Companies are required to disclose data breaches or security lapses to state attorneys-general, but no notices have been published where they are required by law, such as California. The data set had more than 1,800 residents in California, more than three times the number needed to trigger mandatory disclosure under the state&#8217;s data breach notification laws.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not known if Mercato disclosed the incident to investors ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/mercato-raises-26m-series-a-to-help-smaller-grocers-compete-online/">its $26 million Series A raise</a> earlier this month. Velvet Sea Ventures, which led the round, did not respond to emails requesting comment.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mercato chief executive Bobby Brannigan confirmed the incident but declined to answer our questions, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are conducting a complete audit using a third party and will be contacting the individuals who have been affected. We are confident that no credit card data was accessed because we do not store those details on our servers. We will continually inform all authoritative bodies and stakeholders, including investors, regarding the findings of our audit and any steps needed to remedy this situation,&#8221; said Brannigan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We would go all in on a product and we'd build it and put blood, sweat and tears into it, and then I would kill it, and we'd move on to the next thing."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, founder Sean Lane thought he&#8217;d achieved product-market fit.</p>
<p>Speaking to attendees at TechCrunch&#8217;s Early Stage virtual event, Lane said Queue, a secure <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2015/12/16/electronic-check-in-for-hospitals-just-next-step.html">digital check-in</a> tablet for hospital waiting rooms that reduced wait times by uniting and correcting electronic medical records, was &#8220;selling like hotcakes.&#8221; But once Lane realized it would only ever address one piece of a much bigger market opportunity, he sold off the product, laid off two-thirds of the people affiliated with it and redirected the employees who were left.</p>
<p>Lane explained that what he really wanted to build is what his company &#8212; since renamed <a href="https://oliveai.com/">Olive</a> &#8212; has now become, a robotic process automation (RPA) company that takes on hospital workers&#8217; most tedious tasks so nurses and physicians can spend more time with patients.</p>
<p>Customers seem to like it. According to Lane, more than 600 hospitals use the service to assist employees with tasks like prior authorizations and patient verifications.</p>
<p>Investors clearly approve of what Olive is selling, too: Last year, the company raised three rounds of funding totaling roughly $380 million and valuing the company at $1.5 billion. According to Crunchbase, it&#8217;s raised a total of $456 million altogether.</p>
<p>In fact, VCs think so much of Lane that in February, they invested <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-columbus-ohio-insurtech-company-circulo-raises-50m-to-disrupt-medicaid-301231146.html">$50 million</a> in another company that Lane runs simultaneously called <a href="https://www.circulohealth.com/">Circulo</a>, a startup that describes itself as building the &#8220;Medicaid insurance company of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the path from point A to B was painful, and it might not have happened if Lane didn&#8217;t have a few things going for him, including a deeply personal reason to build something that could have greater impact on the U.S. healthcare system.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford will debut its new hands-free driving feature on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year, technology that the automaker developed to rival similar systems from Tesla and GM.</p>
<p>That hands-free capability — which uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition — has undergone some 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford emphasized in its announcement and tweet from its CEO Jim Farley in a not-so-subtle dig at Tesla&#8217;s approach of rolling out beta software to customers. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver’s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p>The hands-free system will be available on vehicles equipped with Ford&#8217;s Co-Pilot360 Technology and will only work on certain sections of divided highways. The system, which will be rolled out via software updates later this year, will initially be available on more than 100,000 miles of highways in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BlueCruise! We tested it in the real world, so our customers don’t have to. <a href="https://t.co/dgqVkWH31r">pic.twitter.com/dgqVkWH31r</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1382323413826555904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The system does comes with a price. BlueCruise software, which includes a three-year service period, will cost $600. The price of upgrading the hardware will depend on the vehicle. For instance, F-150 owners will have to plunk down another $995 for the hardware, while owners of the &#8220;select&#8221; Mustang Mach-E model variant will have to pay an additional $2,600. BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium and First Edition variants of the Mustang Mach-E.</p>
<p>While nearly every automaker offers some driver assistance features, Ford is clearly aiming to compete with or capture market share away from GM and Tesla — the two companies with the best-known and capable ADAS. Convincing customers that its system is worth the expense will be critical to meeting its internal target of selling more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate projections.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM is working on a hands-off advanced driving system for city streets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/gm-is-working-on-a-hands-off-advanced-driving-system-for-city-streets/embed/#?secret=FMJPIbWgXm" data-secret="FMJPIbWgXm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>GM <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/gm-is-working-on-a-hands-off-advanced-driving-system-for-city-streets/">Super Cruise</a> uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they’re paying attention. Unlike Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot feature also combines sensors like cameras and radar, computing power and software. Autopilot, which comes standard in all new Tesla vehicles, will steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane. Tesla uses a torque sensor in the steering wheel to determine if drivers are paying attention, although many owners have found and publicly documented hacks so they can keep their hands off the wheels and eyes off the road ahead. Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/tesla-has-increased-the-price-of-its-full-self-driving-option-to-10000/">charges $10,000 for its upgrade to FSD</a> (its own internal branding meant to stand for full self-driving). FSD is not an autonomous system. It does provide a number of more capable driver-assist functions, including automatic lane changes, the ability to recognize and act upon traffic lights and stop signs and a navigation feature that will suggest lane changes en route and automatically steer the vehicle toward highway interchanges and exits.</p>
<p>Ford said that its system communicates with drivers in different ways, including displaying text and blue lighting cues in the instrument cluster, which it says is effective even for those with color blindness.</p>
<p>The so-called BlueCruise hands-free technology will be offered in other Ford vehicle models in the future, the company said. Drivers who opt for the technology will continue to receive software updates as it is improved. Ford said future improvements will include a feature that will let the vehicle change lanes by tapping the turn signal indicator as well as one that will predict and then adjust vehicle speed for roundabouts and curves. The company also said it plans to offer regular mapping updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is taking another step towards directly funding publishers&#8217; content with today&#8217;s announcement that it&#8217;s financially backing the production of media publisher NowThis&#8217; new series, &#8220;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nowthis/video/6951017466336120069?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">VIRAL</a>,&#8221; which will feature interviews with public health experts and a live Q&amp;A session focused on answering questions about the pandemic. The partnership represents TikTok&#8217;s first-ever funding of an episodic series from a publisher, though TikTok has previously funded creator content.</p>
<p>Through TikTok&#8217;s Instructive Accelerator Program, which was formerly known as the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/investing-to-help-our-community-learn-on-tiktok">Creative Learning Fund</a>, other TikTok publishers have received grants and hands-on support from TikTok so they could produce quality instructive content for TikTok&#8217;s #LearnOnTikTok initiative. The program today is structured as four, eight-week cycles during which time publishers post videos four times per week.</p>
<p>NowThis had also participated in the Creative Learning Fund last year and was selected for the latest cycle of the Instructive Accelerator Program. But its &#8220;VIRAL&#8221; series is separate from these efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NowThis says it brought the concept for the show to TikTok earlier this year outside of the accelerator program, and TikTok greenlit it. TikTok then co-produced the series and provided some funding. Neither NowThis nor TikTok would comment on the extent of the financial backing involved, however.</p>
<p>The &#8220;VIRAL&#8221; series itself is hosted by infectious disease clinical researcher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurel-bristow/">Laurel Bristow</a>, who spent the last year working on COVID treatments and research. Every Thursday, Bristow will break down COVID facts in easy-to-understand language, NowThis says, including things like vaccine efficacy, transmission timelines, and treatment. The show will also bust COVID myths, provide information about ongoing public health risks, and feature interviews with a cross-section of experts.</p>
<p>Each episode of the will be 45 minutes in length and will also include an interactive segment where the TikTok viewing audience will be able to engage in a real-time Q&amp;A session about the show&#8217;s content. In total, five episodes are being produced, and will air starting on Thursday April 15 at 6 PM ET and will run through Thursday May 13 on the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nowthis">@NowThis</a> main TikTok page.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@nowthis/video/6951017466336120069" data-video-id="6951017466336120069">
<section><a title="@nowthis" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nowthis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@nowthis</a>Tune in to our new TikTok live show VIRAL on Thursdays at 6pm ET with host @kinggutterbaby</p>

<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>NowThis has become one of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-21-digital-news-media-accounts-tiktok-ranked-2021-3">most-followed</a> news media accounts on TikTok, with 4.6 million followers across its news and politics channels, since launching a little over a year ago. Because of its focus on video, it&#8217;s been a good fit for the TikTok&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The approach TikTok is taking with &#8220;VIRAL&#8217;s&#8221; production, it&#8217;s worth noting, stands in contrast to how other social media platforms are handling the pandemic and COVID-19 information. While most, including TikTok, have pledged to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/twitter-5g-coronavirus-labels/">fact check</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/as-covid-19-misinformation-grows-youtube-brings-video-fact-checking-to-the-us/">COVID-19 information</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/twitter-will-force-users-to-delete-covid-19-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/">remove</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/">misinformation</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policy/">conspiracies</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/facebook-to-label-all-covid-19-vaccine-posts-with-pointer-to-official-info/">point users to official sources</a> for health information, and provide other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/">resources</a>, TikTok is directly funding public health content featuring scientists and researchers, and then promoting it on its network.</p>
<p>The company explained to TechCrunch its thinking on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the pandemic continues to evolve, we think it&#8217;s important to provide our community an outlet to dispel misinformation and communicate with public health experts in real-time,&#8221; said Robbie Levin, Manager of Media Partnerships at TikTok. &#8220;NowThis has consistently been a great partner that produces engaging and informative content, so we felt this series would be an impactful and important avenue for our users to receive credible information on our platform,&#8221; Levin noted.</p>
<p>While the pandemic has driven the topic of choice here, paying creators for content is not new. And TikTok isn&#8217;t the only one to do so. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/style/snapchat-spotlight.html">Snapchat</a> are both funding creator content for their TikTok clones, Reels and Spotlight, respectively. And new social platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Clubhouse are funding creators&#8217; shows</a>, as well.</p>
<p>TikTok says it&#8217;s not currently talking to other publishers to produce more series like &#8220;VIRAL,&#8221; but it isn&#8217;t ruling out the idea of expanding its creator funding and producing efforts. In addition to its accelerator program, which is continuing, TikTok says if &#8220;VIRAL&#8221; proves successful and the community responds positively, it will pursue similar opportunities in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield">Startup Battlefield</a> — the matriarch of all pitch competitions — is the stuff of tech legend. Heck, it even played a role in the HBO show, “Silicon Valley,” and its influence touches early-stage startups around the globe. Under no circumstance will you find a bigger, better platform for launching your startup to the world.</p>
<p>Battlefield has a long history of producing notable names. Need an example? A little startup by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsVoYyKpTk">Dropbox competed in the Battlefield at TC50</a> (the precursor to Disrupt) way back in 2008.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is on the hunt for innovative, game-changing startups to take the Startup Battlefield challenge and wrangle with the best-of-the-best at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Are you game?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to compete in Startup Battlefield</a> before the deadline closes on <strong>May 13 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The stakes:</strong> A shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. Major exposure for all competing startups — think investors eager to find and fund the next big thing, journalists in search of exciting, game-changing startups to cover and potential customers and partners who can help take your business to new levels of success.</p>
<p><strong>The investment:</strong> Your time. Yup, that’s it. Appyling to and participating in Startup Battlefield is 100 percent free. No fees, no equity cut. You simply invest your time — all participating founders receive several weeks of training with the Startup Battlefield team. Your demo and presentation will be, well, pitch perfect when you deliver it to panels of top VC judges. And you’ll be thoroughly prepped to handle the Q&amp;A that follows.</p>
<p><strong>The perks:</strong> In addition to the massive interest from just about all Disrupt attendees, competing startups get exhibition space in the Startup Alley expo area, free passes to future TechCrunch events, a free membership to Extra Crunch and invitations to private events like the Startup Battlefield reception.</p>
<p>You’ll meet members of the Startup Battlefield alumni community — we’re talking about 922 companies (like Vurb, Mint, Yammer and, yes, Dropbox) that have collectively raised $9.5 billion and produced 117 exits. Once Disrupt ends, you’re part of this phenomenal community — just imagine the networking possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>The details:</strong> Read more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/applications-for-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021-are-now-open/">how Startup Battlefield works</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After inking a deal to work together <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-partners-with-ocado-to-serve-customers-anything-anytime-anywhere-in-us-300650210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost three years ago</a>, U.S. supermarket chain Kroger and U.K. online grocer Ocado today took the wraps off the first major product of that deal. Kroger has launched a new Ocado-powered customer fulfillment center in Monroe, Ohio, outside of Cincinnati, a gigantic warehouse covering 375,000 square feet and thousands of products for packing and delivering Kroger orders from online shoppers.</p>
<p>Built with a giant grid along the floor, &#8220;the shed&#8221;, as Ocado calls its warehouses, will feature some 1,000 robots alongside 400 human employees to pick, sort and move around items. It is expected to process as much as $700 million in sales annually, the sales of 20 brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p>Those orders, in turn, will be delivered in temperature-controlled Kroger Delivery vans, built on the model of Ocado&#8217;s vans in the US and able to store up to 20 orders. These will also be run using Ocado software, mapping algorithms to optimize deliveries along the fastest and most fuel-efficient routes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The partnership was a long time in the making but the focus on what has come out of it is probably at its keenest right now, given the huge boost online shopping has had in the past year. The Covid-19 pandemic, and the resulting push for more social distancing, has driven a lot of people to the internet to shop, opting for deliveries over physical store visits for some or all of their food and other weekly essentials.</p>
<p>In call today with journalists, Rodney McMullen, Kroger&#8217;s chairman and CEO, said that delivery had grown 150% for Kroger last year. While some of that may well melt back into physical shopping as and when Covid-19 cases wane (fingers crossed), many in the industry believe that the genie has been let out of the bottle, so to speak: many consumers introduced to shopping online will stay, at least in part, and so this is about building infrastructure to meet that new demand.</p>
<p>(And there is some data that backs that up: Ocado CEO and co-founder Tim Steiner noted that at Ocado, pre-pandemic the average order value for the company was £105 ($144). That grew to £180 last year, and are at £120.)</p>
<p>Kroger, like many brick-and-mortar players, has been building out multiple fronts in its digital strategy. Alongside Ocado, the company has also been investing in technology to boost the efficiency of its in-store operations (for example by working with companies like <a href="https://www.shelfengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelf Engine</a>), and it has a grocery delivery partnership with Instacart.</p>
<p>That partnership with Instacart will remain in place, not least because it covers a much wider geography than the Ocado approach, which is live now in Cincinnati, and sounds like it will also expand to Florida. While Kroger today said that CFCs will vary in size and be built on the concept of &#8220;modules&#8221; (the Monroe facility is built on seven modules), this is still a capital intensive approach compared to the Instacart model, so might overall face a slower rollout and perhaps only make sense in Kroger&#8217;s denser markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two partnerships are critical to Kroger and our customers,&#8221; said Yael Cosset, Kroger&#8217;s CIO, in the call today. &#8220;We expect to work very closely in strategic partnership with Instacart and with Ocado.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ocado, an early player that started out in the UK back in 2000, is seen by many as the industry standard for how to build and run an online-only grocery business.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding its reach by way of taking the technology that it has built for itself and turning it into a product &#8212; a process that is still very much in development, with the company working now on robotic pickers and other autonomous systems, along with other technology to power and make its delivery service more efficient.</p>
<p>Ocado&#8217;s &#8220;AWS&#8221; strategy of turning tech that it has built for itself into a product to sell to others has born fruit: it now has partnerships to power online grocery services, and specifically fulfillment centers, in Japan (with <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/Aeon-to-build-smart-warehouse-with-aid-of-UK-grocer-Ocado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aeon</a>), France (with <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/grocery/ocados-first-international-depot-goes-live-in-france/7034480.article?authent=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casino</a>) and Canada (with <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2019/ocado-announces-second-sobeys-cfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sobeys</a>). That means the Kroger rollout is now a tested model, but it&#8217;s still a very notable move for the company to break into the U.S. while at the same time giving Kroger a much-needed bit of infrastructure to better compete with bigger players in the country like Walmart and Amazon.</p>
<p>In that regard, it will be interesting to see how and if Kroger leverages its much bigger Ocado-powered infrastructure for its other projects. The company is <a href="https://blog.mirakl.com/kroger-leads-the-digital-grocery-revolution-with-mirakl-powered-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with Mirakl</a> to develop its own marketplace for third-party retailers, going head to head with similar offerings from &#8212; yes &#8212; Amazon and Walmart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making deepfake videos used to be hard. Now all you need is a smartphone. <a href="https://avatarify.ai/">Avatarify</a>, a startup that allows people to make deepfake videos directly on their phone rather than in the cloud, is soaring up the app charts after being used by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham.</p>
<p>However, the problem with many deepfake videos is that there is no digital watermark to determine that the video has been tampered with. So Avatarify says it will soon launch a digital watermark to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Run out of Moscow but with a U.S. HQ, Avatarify launched in July 2020 and since then has been downloaded millions of times. The founders say that 140 million deepfake videos were created with Avatarify this year alone. There are now 125 million views of videos with the hashtag #avatarify on TikTok. While its competitors include the well-funded Reface, Snapchat, Wombo.ai, Mug Life and Xpression, Avatarify has yet to raise any money beyond an angel round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite taking only $120,000 in angel funding, the company has yet to accept any venture capital and says it has bootstrapped its way from zero to almost 10 million downloads and claims to have a $10 million annual run rate with a team of less than 10 people.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see why. Avatarify has a freemium subscription model. They offer a 7-day free trial and a 12-month subscription for $34.99 or a weekly plan for $2.49. Without a subscription, they offer the core features of the app for free, but videos then carry a visible watermark.</p>
<p>The founders also say the app protects privacy, because the videos are processed directly on the phone, rather than in the cloud where they could be hacked.</p>
<p>Avatarify processes user&#8217;s photos and turns them into short videos by animating faces, using machine learning algorithms and adding sounds. The user chooses a picture they want to animate, chooses the effects and music, and then taps to animate the picture. This short video can then be posted on Instagram or TikTok.</p>
<p>The Avatarify videos are taking off on TikTok because teens no longer need to learn a dance or be much more creative than finding a photo of a celebrity to animate to.</p>
<p>Avartify says you can’t use their app to impersonate someone, but there is of course no way to police this.</p>
<p>Co-founders Ali Aliev and Karim Iskakov wrote the app during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. Ali spent two hours writing a program in Python to transfer his facial expressions to the other person’s face and use a filter in Zoom. The result was a real-time video, which could be streamed to Zoom. He joined a call with Elon Mask&#8217;s face and everyone on the call was shocked. The team posted the video, which then went viral.</p>
<p>They posted the code on Github and immediately saw the number of downloads grow. The repository was published on 6 April 2020, and as of 19 March 2021 had been downloaded 50,000 times.</p>
<p>Ali left his job at Samsung AI Centre and devoted himself to the app. After Avatarify’s iOS app was released on 28 June 2020, viral videos on TikTok, created with the app, led it to App Store’s top charts without paid acquisition. In February 2021, Avatarify was ranked first among Top Free Apps worldwide. Between February and March, the app 2021 generated more than $1 million in revenue (Source: AppMagic).</p>
<p>However, despite Avartify’s success, the ongoing problems with deepfake videos remain, such as using these apps to make nonconsensual porn, using the faces of innocent people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s no doubt this past year has been a major watershed moment for the robotics industry. Warehouse and logistics have been a particular target for an automation push, as companies have worked to keep the lights on amidst stay at home orders and other labor shortages.</p>
<p>MIT spinoff <a href="https://www.picklerobot.com/">Pickle</a> is one of the latest startups to enter the fray. The company launched with limited funding and a small team, though it’s recently changed one of these, telling TechCrunch this week that it has raised $5.57 million in funding during this hot investment streak. The seed round was led by Hyperplane and featured Third Kind Venture Capital, Box Group and Version One Ventures, among others.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-IwGbEIU08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s making some pretty big claims around the efficacy of its first robot named, get this, “Dill” (the company clearly can’t avoid a clever name). It says the robot is capable of 1,600 picks per hour from the back of a trailer, a figure it claims is “double the speed of any competitors.”</p>
<p>CEO Andrew Meyer says collaboration is a key to the company’s play. “We designed people into the system from the get-go and focused on a specific problem: package handling in the loading dock. We got out of the lab and put robots to work in real warehouses. We resisted the fool’s errand of trying to create a system that could work entirely unsupervised or solve every robotics problem out there.”</p>
<p>Orders for the first product targeted at trailer unloading will open in June, with an expected ship date of early 2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Von Tobel outlines steps to stay out of debt, build credit and accumulate wealth to ensure financial peace of mind as you take on the most stressful venture of your life: Starting a company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people are more knowledgable on the topic of how founders should manage their finances than Alexa von Tobel. She is a certified financial planner, started her own company in the midst of the recession (which happened to be a wildly successful personal finance startup that sold for hundreds of millions of dollars) and is now a VC who invests and advises founders.</p>
<p>At Early Stage 2021, she gave a presentation on how founders should think about managing their own wealth. Startup founders can often put all their money into their venture and end up paying more attention to the finances of their company than their own bank account.</p>
<p>Von Tobel outlined the various steps you can take to stay out of debt, build credit and accumulate wealth through investments to ensure you have financial peace of mind as you take on the most stressful venture of your life: Starting a company.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Know your numbers</h2>
<p>The first step in getting organized and being proactive is often taking inventory. Von Tobel believes that knowing your numbers and getting organized digitally is the first step to having financial peace of mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Know all your numbers. Know your net worth. What are your assets? What&#8217;s your debt? What does your total financial picture look like? Get everything online. You should have all the mobile apps downloaded so that, in minutes, you can actually see your full financial life. And keep it simple. Fewer accounts are better. I always tell people, if you have seven credit cards, plus three savings accounts, that&#8217;s a lot. You&#8217;re never going to be as good at managing your finances. Simplify your accounts. <em><strong>(Time stamp — 2:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Manage your credit and debt</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/changes-to-feedburner?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20blogspot%2FamDG%20(Google%20Search%20Central%20Blog)">announced</a> that it is moving FeedBurner to a new infrastructure but also deprecating its email subscription service.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an internet user of a certain age, chances are you used Google&#8217;s <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> to manage the RSS feeds of your personal blogs and early podcasts at some point. During the Web 2.0 era, it was the de facto standard for feed management and analytics, after all. Founded in 2004, with Dick Costolo as one of its co-founders (before he became Twitter&#8217;s CEO in 2010), it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">acquired by Google</a> in 2007.</p>
<p>Ever since, FeedBurner lingered in an odd kind of limbo. While Google had no qualms shutting down popular services like Google Reader in favor of its ill-fated social experiments like Google+, FeedBurner just kept burning feeds day in and day out, even as Google slowly deprecated some parts of the service, most notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/the-feedburner-deathwatch-continues-google-kills-adsense-for-feeds/">its advertising integrations</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="b687WFxHB6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">$100 Million Payday For Feedburner &#8211; This Deal Is Confirmed</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$100 Million Payday For Feedburner &#8211; This Deal Is Confirmed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/embed/#?secret=b687WFxHB6" data-secret="b687WFxHB6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that anybody spent a lot of time thinking about the service and RSS has slowly (and sadly) fallen into obscurity, yet the service was probably easy enough to maintain that Google kept it going. And despite everything, shutting it down would probably break enough tools for publishers to create quite an uproar. The TechCrunch RSS feed, to which you are surely subscribed in your desktop RSS reader, is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/">http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/</a>, after all.</p>
<p>So here we are, 14 years later, and Google today announced that it is &#8220;making several upcoming changes to support the product&#8217;s next chapter.&#8221; It&#8217;s moving the service to a new, more stable infrastructure.</p>
<p>But in July, it is also shutting down some non-core features that don&#8217;t directly involve feed management, most importantly the FeedBurner email subscription service that allowed you to get emailed alerts when a feed updates. Feed owners will be able to download their email subscriber lists (and will be able to do so after July, too). With that, Blogger&#8217;s FollowByEmail widget will <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/10477563">also be deprecated</a> (and hey, did you start this day thinking you&#8217;d read about FeedBurner AND Blogger on TechCrunch without having to travel back to 2007?).</p>
<p>Google stresses that other core FeedBurner features <a href="https://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/10483501">will remain in place</a>, but given the popularity of email newsletters, that&#8217;s a bit of an odd move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today shares of Coinbase began to trade after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">executed a direct listing</a>. From a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">reference price of $250</a>, Coinbase shares opened at $381 today, a change of around 52%. At its open Coinbase was valued at $99.6 billion on a fully diluted basis. As of the time of writing Coinbase has appreciated further to just over $400 per share, valuing the company at a touch more than $104 billion.</p>
<p>Coinbase was worth $65.3 billion at its reference price, on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s debut has been hotly anticipated, thanks to its position inside the greater crypto economy and, from a purely startup perspective, its huge value unlock. Private investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">poured capital into the company</a> during its life as a private company, valuing it as high as $8 billion.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new valuation dwarfs that prior figure, implying strong returns for its long-term backers. Today even regular folks could get a scratch at the company&#8217;s equity, and they were willing to pay up for the privilege. TechCrunch asked its audience about the debut, pre-trading results that served as an anti-indicator of where the crypto-unicorn&#8217;s shares would trade:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Would you pay more or less than $250/share for Coinbase? (read up on today&#39;s direct listing: <a href="https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX">https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX</a>)</p>
<p>&mdash; Extra Crunch (@ExtraCrunch) <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtraCrunch/status/1382333411898101760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For Coinbase the road ahead is interesting. The company is richly capitalized and posted monster profits in its most recent quarter. However, Coinbase has yet to chart a future sufficiently delinked from the impacts of cryptocurrency price levels and resulting trading volume to be immune to a potential setback in growth and income if the value of bitcoin, et al. dropped.</p>
<p>But for crypto believers, watching Coinbase list is a win; it is ironic that a traditional company listing on an old-fashioned exchange is a key moment for the crypto economy, but most things come in steps. Perhaps the next major crypto company trading debut will be on a decentralized exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Banking tech startup <a href="https://www.zeta.tech/in">Zeta</a> is inching closer to the much sought-after unicorn status as it engages with investors to finalize a new round, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is in advanced stages of talks to lead a ~$250 million Series D round in the five-year-old startup, the sources said. The investment proposal values the Indian startup, co-founded by high-profile entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, at over $1 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/zeta-300m-sodexo/">$300 million in its maiden external funding (Series C) in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The round has yet to close, a third person said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Five-year-old Zeta helps banks launch modern retail and fintech products. The thesis is that banks &#8212; largely operating on antiquated technologies &#8212; today don&#8217;t have the time and expertise to offer the best experience to hundreds of millions of customers and fintech firms they serve.</p>
<p>Zeta is attempting to help banks either use the startup&#8217;s cloud-native, API-first banking stack as its core framework or build services atop it to offer better a experience to all customers &#8212; think of improved mobile app and debit and credit features. It also offers API, SDKs and payment gateways to banks to work more efficiently with fintech firms.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed clients in several Asian and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Turakhia, with his brother Divyank, started his first venture in 1998. Along the way, they sold four web companies to Endurance for $160 million. Zeta is the third startup Bhavin has co-founded since then &#8212; the other being business messaging platform Flock and Radix.</p>
<p>When the deal is finalized, Zeta would join a growing list of Indian startups that have turned a unicorn in recent months. Last week, social commerce Meesho &#8212; also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2</a> &#8212; fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED</a>, e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy, millennials-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">social network ShareChat</a> attained the unicorn status.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated with additional details and to note that the round hasn&#8217;t closed.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Would be TikTok competitor Triller, operated by parent company TrillerNet, is gaining a new CEO, the company announced today. The short-form video app said it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trillernet-acquires-leading-ai-powered-customer-engagement-platform-amplifyai-for-completion-of-trillers-launch-of-internet-3-0-301269016.html">acquiring</a> an A.I.-based customer engagement platform, Amplify.AI, whose co-founder Mahi de Silva will now become TrillerNet&#8217;s CEO. Existing CEO Mike Lu will transition to president of TrillerNet and will focus on investor relations. The company separately announced the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/triller-parent-company-buys-combat-sports-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquisition</a> of FITE TV, a live event and pay-per-view combat sports streaming platform.</p>
<p>New CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdesilva/">Mahi de Silva</a> had been closely involved with Triller before today. The company&#8217;s press release today says he&#8217;s been serving as non-executive chairman since 2016, but his LinkedIn notes the year was 2019 (which would be following Triller&#8217;s 2019 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">funding</a> by Proxima Media, when the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">press release at the time</a> noted he was assuming the role of &#8220;chairman.&#8221;)  These are both wrong, the company discovered when we reached out for clarity. The correct year is 2018.</p>
<p>Ahead of the acquisition, de Silva had been serving as CEO and co-founder to Amplify.AI since 2017, and before that was CEO of Opera Mediaworks, the marketing and advertising arm of Opera Software, and co-founder and CEO of Botworx.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amplify.AI, which works with brands in CPG, financial services, automotive, telecom, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/amplify-ai-the-conversational-ai-startup-founded-by-two-south-asians-has-scored-big-with-brands-and-governments/articleshow/80443958.cms">politics</a> and digital media, among others, will continue to operate as a subsidiary of TrillerNet following the deal. Other team members include former RSA and VeriSign executive Ram Moskovitz who helped design and develop the digital certificates for SSL and code signing; and Amplify.ai co-founder and CTO Manoj Malhotra, a pioneer in B2C SMS messaging, the company notes.</p>
<p>TrillerNet also today announced it&#8217;s acquiring another strategic property to help shift its business further into the direction of live events: FITE TV. This deal gives Triller more of a foothold in the live events and pay-per-view streaming market, it says. As a result, FITE, which touts 10 million users, will become the exclusive digital distributor of all Triller Fight Club boxing events going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acquiring FITE is part of the larger Triller strategy to bring together content, creators and commerce for the first time and the only place where they truly interact,&#8221; said Triller&#8217;s Ryan Kavanaugh, the former head of movie studio Relativity Media (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/triller-wants-to-be-the-next-tiktok-its-backers-want-a-second-act-11602255601">and controversial figure</a>) whose Proxima Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/triller-tiktok/">became</a> Triller&#8217;s majority investor in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">2019.</a> &#8220;We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and believe we have created a better more efficient e-commerce content platform,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows several others TrillerNet has made to expand into live events, now that becoming a TikTok replacement in the U.S. is no longer a viable option, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">the Trump ban was put on hold</a> by the Biden administration. Triller also in March acquired live music streaming platform Verzuz, founded by Swizz Beats and Timbaland. And it operates Triller Flight Club in partnership with Snoop Dogg, as well as a streaming platform Triller TV.</p>
<p>While specific deal terms were not revealed, Triller told TechCrunch it&#8217;s spent $250 million in the aggregate on its acquisitions, including Halogen, Mashtraxx, Verzuz, FITE and Amplify today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin has launched its New Shepard rocket for the second time this year, and the 15th time overall. The mission profile saw the reusable spacecraft fly to suborbital space, and then return for a parachute-assisted landing at Blue Origin&#8217;s launch facility in West Texas.</p>
<p>This flight was a little different than its usual missions, because it included a rehearsal component with people standing in for what will eventually be Blue Origin&#8217;s paying private astronaut customers. What that means is that they actually went through the process of flight preparations, including transporting to the pad, and even climbing in to the New Shepard vehicle and getting seated as if they were going along for the ride.</p>
<p>The crucial difference between this and an actual passenger flight is that Blue Origin then paused the countdown, and the mock crew disembarked, before the countdown was resumed and the flight proceeded as planned — without any passengers, save for Mannequin Skywalker, the Blue Origin test dummy who flies on these preparation missions to take crucial readings during the launch and return.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Shepard returned and touched down without any issue, and in fact showed off one of its smoothest landings yet. This was the second launch and landing for this particular booster stage. The capsule also touched down as planned, with a soft landing facilitated by the spacecraft&#8217;s parachute descent system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138511" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138511" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2138511 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="552" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2138511" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin</p></div></p>
<p>Next up, Blue Origin is going to do a dry run of what would be the ending stage of the mission for an actual human crew, by bringing out those rehearsal astronauts and putting them back into the capsule, then rehearsing in full the astronaut recovery and departure process that would occur during a live tourist flight.</p>
<p>All of today&#8217;s activities showed off what Blue Origin hopes to accomplish sometime this year with people on board. It&#8217;s yet another way paying private astronauts can get to space, in a growing roster of options that now includes SpaceX Dragon flights, and hopefully soon, Virgin Galactic launches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Labor activists challenging Uber over what they allege are &#8216;robo-firings&#8217; of drivers in Europe have trumpeted winning a default judgement in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1415&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=ECLI%3aNL%3aRBAMS%3a2021%3a1415">ordered</a> the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>
<p>The challenge references Article 22 of the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which provides protection for individuals against purely automated decisions with a legal or significant impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The activists say this is the first time a court has ordered the overturning of an automated decision to dismiss workers from employment.</p>
<p>However the judgement, which was issued on February 24, was issued by default &#8212; and Uber says it was not aware of the case until last week, claiming that was why it did not contest it (nor, indeed, comply with the order).</p>
<p>It had until March 29 to do so, per the litigants, who are being supported by the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE).</p>
<p>Uber argues the default judgement was not correctly served and says it is now making an application to set the default ruling aside and have its case heard &#8220;on the basis that the correct procedure was not followed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It envisages the hearing taking place within four weeks of its Dutch entity, Uber BV, being made aware of the judgement &#8212; which it says occurred on April 8.</p>
<p>“Uber only became aware of this default judgement last week, due to representatives for the ADCU not following proper legal procedure,&#8221; an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for WIE denied that correct procedure was not followed but welcomed the opportunity for Uber to respond to questions over how its driver ID systems operate in court, adding: &#8220;They [Uber] are out of time. But we&#8217;d be happy to see them in court. They will need to show meaningful human intervention <em>and</em> provide transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber pointed to a separate judgement by the Amsterdam Court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">last month</a> &#8212; which rejected another ADCU- and WIE-backed challenge to Uber&#8217;s anti-fraud systems, with the court accepting its explanation that algorithmic tools are mere aids to human &#8220;anti-fraud&#8221; teams who it said take all decisions on terminations.</p>
<p>&#8220;With no knowledge of the case, the Court handed down a default judgement in our absence, which was automatic and not considered. Only weeks later, the very same Court found comprehensively in Uber’s favour on similar issues in a separate case. We will now contest this judgement,&#8221; Uber&#8217;s spokesperson added.</p>
<p>However WIE said this default judgement &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; challenge specifically targets Uber&#8217;s Hybrid Real-Time ID System &#8212; a system that incorporates facial recognition checks and which labor activists recently found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/">misidentifying drivers in a number of instances</a>.</p>
<p>It also pointed to a separate development this week in the U.K. where it said the City of London Magistrates Court ordered the city&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, to reinstate the licence of one of the drivers revoked after Uber routinely notified it of a dismissal (also triggered by Uber&#8217;s real time ID system, per WIE).</p>
<p>Reached for comment on that, a TfL spokesperson said: “The safety of the travelling public is our top priority and where we are notified of cases of driver identity fraud, we take immediate licensing action so that passenger safety is not compromised. We always require the evidence behind an operator’s decision to dismiss a driver and review it along with any other relevant information as part of any decision to revoke a licence. All drivers have the right to appeal a decision to remove a licence through the Magistrates’ Court.”</p>
<p>The regulator has been applying pressure to Uber since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">2017</a> when it took the (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/uber-only-has-itself-to-blame-for-london-license-loss/">shocking to Uber</a>) decision to revoke the company&#8217;s licence to operate &#8212; citing safety and corporate governance concerns.</p>
<p>Since then Uber has been able to continue to operate in the U.K. capital but the company remains under pressure to comply with a laundry list of requirements set by TfL as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal/">tries to regain a full operator licence</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the default Dutch judgement on the Uber driver terminations in a statement, James Farrar, director of WIE, accused gig platforms of &#8220;hiding management control in algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Uber drivers robbed of their jobs and livelihoods this has been a dystopian nightmare come true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were publicly accused of ‘fraudulent activity’ on the back of poorly governed use of bad technology. This case is a wake-up call for lawmakers about the abuse of surveillance technology now proliferating in the gig economy. In the aftermath of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling</a> on worker rights gig economy platforms are hiding management control in algorithms. This is misclassification 2.0.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of the ADCU, added: &#8220;I am deeply concerned about the complicit role Transport for London has played in this catastrophe. They have encouraged Uber to introduce surveillance technology as a price for keeping their operator’s license and the result has been devastating for a TfL licensed workforce that is 94% BAME. The Mayor of London must step in and guarantee the rights and freedoms of Uber drivers licensed under his administration<em>.&#8221;  </em></p>
<p>When pressed on the driver termination challenge being specifically targeted at its Hybrid Real-Time ID system, Uber declined to comment in greater detail &#8212; claiming the case is &#8220;now a live court case again&#8221;.</p>
<p>But its spokesman suggested it will seek to apply the same defence against the earlier &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; charge &#8212; when it argued its anti-fraud systems do not equate to automated decision making under EU law because &#8220;meaningful human involvement [is] involved in decisions of this nature&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, we wrote about fintech Pilot raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doubled the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bezos Expeditions — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal investment fund — and Whale Rock Capital joined the round, adding $40 million to a $60 million raise led by Sequoia about one month prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That raise came after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/index-ventures-stripe-back-bookkeeping-service-pilot-with-40m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $40 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April 2019 co-led by Stripe and Index Ventures that valued the company at $355 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both raises were notable and warranted coverage. But sometimes it’s fun to take a peek at the stories behind the raises and dig deeper into the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here we go.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uLylNiO7FV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/">Jeff Bezos&#8217; investment fund is backing a startup hoping to be the AWS for SMB accounting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff Bezos&#8217; investment fund is backing a startup hoping to be the AWS for SMB accounting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/embed/#?secret=uLylNiO7FV" data-secret="uLylNiO7FV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, San Francisco-based Pilot &#8212; which has a mission of affordably providing back-office services such as bookkeeping to startups and SMBs &#8212; apparently had term sheets that offered “2x the $40M” raised in its Series B. But it chose not to raise so much capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also heard that the same investor that ended up leading a now defunct competitor&#8217;s $60 million raise first asked to invest $60 million in Pilot as a follow-on to that Series B prior to making the other investment. While I don’t know for sure, I can only presume that what is being referred to is ScaleFactor’s</span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/scalefactor-raises-third-round-60m-in-13-months-after-700-arr-growth-in-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $60 million Series C raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2019 that was led by Coatue Management. (ScaleFactor </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=5fdc8e1f2928"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crashed and burned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CFO Paul Jun: “There were many periods when Pilot turned away new customers and growth capital instead of absolutely maximizing short-term growth&#8230;Pilot prioritized building the foundational investments needed for scalability, reliability and high velocity. When it was presented with the opportunity for additional funding towards further growth in 2019, it declined to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Waseem Daher elaborates, pointing out that the first company that Pilot&#8217;s founding team ran, Ksplice, was bootstrapped before getting acquired by Oracle in 2011. (It&#8217;s also worth noting that the founding team are all MIT computer scientists.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, the reason to raise money is you believe that you can deploy the capital, to grow the company or to basically cause the company to grow at the rate you&#8217;d like to grow. And it doesn&#8217;t make sense to raise money if you don&#8217;t need it, or don&#8217;t have a good plan for what to do with it,” Daher told TechCrunch. “Too much capital can be bad because it sort of leads you to bad habits&#8230;When you have the money, you spend the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite what he describes as “a great deal of institutional interest” in 2019, Pilot opted to raise just $40 million, instead of $80 million to $100 million, because it was the amount of capital the company had confidence that it could deploy successfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Jun shared some numbers beyond the recent raise amount and valuation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has tripled revenue every year since inception, except for 2020 when it doubled revenue.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot claims to have had a cash burn of $800,000 per month in 2020 against a starting balance of $40 million.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup touts a 60% GAAP gross margin. Daher notes: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We feel really good about having long-term unit economics that will work for this business without resorting to offshoring or outsourcing in a way that could compromise quality and compromise relationships.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line is companies don&#8217;t have to accept all the capital that&#8217;s offered to them. And maybe in some cases, they shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
