										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When Privacy.com was founded in 2014, the company’s focus was to let anyone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/25/with-privacy-you-can-create-virtual-debit-cards-to-protect-your-online-payments/">generate virtual and disposable payment card numbers</a> for free.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal was to allow those users to keep users’ actual credit card numbers safe while allowing the option to cut off companies from their bank accounts. In an age of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach">near-constant data breaches</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/magecart-hackers-persistent-credit-card-skimmer-groups/">credit card skimmers</a> targeting unsuspecting websites, Privacy.com has made it harder for hackers to get anyone’s real credit card details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The concept has appealed to many. At the time of its $10.2 million Series A last July, <a href="http://privacy.com/">Privacy.com</a> said it had issued 5 million virtual card numbers. Today, that number has more than doubled, to over 10 million, according to CEO and co-founder Bo Jiang.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“We set out to create the safest and fastest way to pay online. Our mobile app and web browser extension lets you generate a virtual card for every purchase you want to make online,” Jiang explained. “That can be especially convenient for things like managing subscriptions or making sure your kid doesn’t spend $1,000 on Fortnite skins.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the New York-based company realized the value in the technology it had developed to issue the virtual and disposable payment cards. So after beta testing for a year, Privacy.com launched its new Card Issuing API in 2020 to give corporate customers the ability to create payment cards for their customers, optimize back-office operations or simplify disbursements.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wV0F7dMrJT"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/privacy-virtual-payment-card-startup/">Privacy.com, a virtual payment card startup, raises $10.2M in Series A</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy.com, a virtual payment card startup, raises $10.2M in Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/privacy-virtual-payment-card-startup/embed/#?secret=wV0F7dMrJT" data-secret="wV0F7dMrJT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">The early growth of the new card issuing platform, dubbed Lithic, has prompted the startup to shift its business strategy &#8212; and rebrand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the process of building out its consumer product, Privacy.com ended up building a lot of infrastructure around programmatically creating cards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you think about the anatomy of credit/debit card transactions there’s a number of modern processors such as Stripe, Adyen, Braintree and Checkout,” Jiang told TechCrunch. “On the flip side, we’re focused on card creation and issuing, and the APIs for actually creating cards. That side has lagged the card acquiring side by five to seven years&#8230;We’ve built a lot to support card creation for ourselves, and realized tons of other developers need this to create cards.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of its new strategy, Privacy.com announced today that it has changed its name to Lithic and raised $43 million in Series B funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners to double down on its card issuing platform and new B2B focus. Index Ventures, Tusk Venture Partners, Rainfall Ventures, Teamworthy Ventures and Walkabout Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings Lithic’s total raised to date to $61 million.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155116" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155116" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2155116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="515" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bo-Jiang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lithic CEO and co-founder Bo Jiang / Lithic</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Privacy.com, the company’s consumer product, will continue to operate as a separate brand powered by the Lithic card issuing platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put simply, Lithic was designed to make it simple for developers to programmatically create virtual and physical payment cards. Jiang is encouraged by the platform’s early success, noting that enterprise issuing volumes tripled in the last four months. It competes with the likes of larger fintech players such as Marqeta and Galileo, although Jiang notes that Lithic’s target customer is more of an early-stage startup than a large, established company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Marqeta, for example, goes after enterprise and is less focused on developers and making their infrastructure accessible. And, Galileo too,” he told TechCrunch. “When you compare us to them, because we’re a younger company, we have the benefit of building a much more modern infrastructure. That allows us to bring costs down but also to be more nimble to the needs of startups.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The benefits touted by Lithic’s “self-serve” platform include being able to “instantly” issue a card and “accessible building blocks,” or what the company describes as focused functionality so developers can include only the features they want.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit? An opportunity for a new revenue stream. Developers earn back a percentage of interchange revenue generated by the merchant, according to Lithic. “What we’ve noticed is a lot of folks have really big ambitions to build more of a stack in-house. We offer a path for folks by bringing more of a payments piece of the world that they can build for scale,” he said. “As a result of all these things, we end up not competing head to head with Marqeta, for example, on a ton of deals.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company charges a fee per card for Lithic API customers (it&#8217;s free for Privacy.com). And it makes money on interchange fees with both offerings.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gvH0uWbxMr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/how-to-break-into-silicon-valley-as-an-outsider/">How to break into Silicon Valley as an outsider</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to break into Silicon Valley as an outsider&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/how-to-break-into-silicon-valley-as-an-outsider/embed/#?secret=gvH0uWbxMr" data-secret="gvH0uWbxMr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">For Charles Birnbaum, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, the shift from B2C to B2B is a smart strategy. He believes Lithic is building a critical piece of the embedded fintech and payments infrastructure stack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have been big fans of the Privacy.com team and product since the beginning, but once we started to see such strong organic growth across the fintech landscape for their new card processing developer platform the past year, we just had to find a way to partner with the team for this next phase of growth,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Index Ventures partner Mark Goldberg notes that as every business becomes a fintech, there&#8217;s been an “explosion” in demand for online payments and card issuance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Lithic has stood out to us as being the developer-friendly solution here &#8212; it&#8217;s fast, powerful and insanely easy to get up-and-running,” he said. “We&#8217;ve heard from customers that Lithic can power a launch in the same amount of time it takes an incumbent issuer to return a phone call.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lithic plans to use its new capital to expand the tools and tech it offers to developers to issue and manage virtual cards as well as enhance its Privacy.com offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok today is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-combat-bullying">introducing</a> a feature that will allow creators to deal with online abuse in an easier way. The company is launching new tools that will allow creators to bulk delete comments and block users, instead of having to moderate comments one-by-one. The update may be somewhat controversial, as it allows creators to curate a persona where the content they&#8217;ve posted is seemingly well-received, when in reality, it had a lot of pushback or correction from the broader TikTok community.</p>
<p>Twitter had faced this same issue in the past, and ultimately split the difference between giving the original poster control over the conversation or ceding that control to the Twitter user base at large. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/twitter-rolls-out-its-hide-replies-feature-to-all-users-worldwide/">Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;Hidden Replies&#8221; feature</a>, it allow users to tuck all the unhelpful and rude comments behind an extra click &#8212; that way, the replies themselves were not removed entirely, but they weren&#8217;t allowed to derail a conversation.</p>
<p>TikTok, on the other hand, is putting full control in the hands of the creator. That&#8217;s a more Facebook-like approach, where users can delete anything they want from appearing on their own user profile &#8212; including comments on their posts that they don&#8217;t like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2155095" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155095" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155095" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-Bulk-Delete-Report-and-Block-Accounts.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155095" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok; image shows the bulk delete tool (why is the user deleting nice comments, though?)</p></div></p>
<p>This may be the right choice for TikTok, since its social network is mainly designed to have conversations through videos. Video formats like duets and stitches allow TikTok users to react and reply to other content on the site, while also creating new content that raises a creator&#8217;s own profile. Some creators use this to their advantage. They single out others who&#8217;ve posted something they disagree with &#8212; often content that toes the line between being a &#8220;bad opinion&#8221; and one that violates rules around misinformation. They then duet or stitch (or<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-launches-a-green-screen-duet-feature-tests-dedicated-topics-feeds/"> green screen duet</a>) that content to share their own thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>However, this process can send a brigade of angry fans over to the other video, where they proceed to troll and harass the original poster. (To what extent that&#8217;s a warranted reaction may depend on your own stance on the post and the politics in question.)</p>
<p>TikTok says such abuse can be &#8220;discouraging.&#8221; It certainly has been for some of TikTok&#8217;s early stars, like Charli D&#8217;Amelio, a teenage girl who somehow rocketed to TikTok stardom, where she now has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio?lang=en">nearly 116 million followers</a>. D&#8217;Amelio has begun to speak more publicly about the <a href="https://www.insider.com/psychologists-say-social-media-fame-may-harm-child-star-influencers-2020-5">downsides of her online fame</a>, saying she now <a href="https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a36395497/charli-damelio-says-tiktok-lost-its-joy/">finds it difficult to find enjoyment</a> on TikTok due the mounting criticism she receives there. This includes the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/charli-damelio-tiktok-passion">abusive remarks she received</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/52442542">body shaming</a>, and dealing with<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/charli-damelio-says-tiktok-has-become-too-competitive-to-enjoy"> the competitive, dishonest nature of the influencer set,</a> among other things.</p>
<p>The new bulk delete feature doesn&#8217;t solve these problems, but it may allow creators to clean up their comment section and block trolls quickly enough that they can re-establish some semblance of control over their profile.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users can long-press on a comment or tap the pencil icon in the upper-left corner to open a window of options. From here, they can select up to 100 comments or accounts instead of going one-by-one, making it easier to delete or report multiple comments or block users in bulk.</p>
<p>TikTok says the new feature is rolling out first to Great Britain, South Korea, Spain, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Thailand, and will continue to expand to other markets globally in the weeks to come, including the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GPS is one of those science fiction technologies whose use is effortless for the end user and endlessly challenging for the engineers who design it. It’s now at the heart of modern life: everything from Amazon package deliveries to our cars and trucks to our walks through national parks are centered around a pin on a map that monitors us down to a few meters.</p>
<p>Yet, GPS technology is decades old, and it’s going through a much-needed modernization. The U.S., Europe, China, Japan and others have been installing a new generation of GNSS satellites (GNSS is the generic name for GPS, which is the specific name for the U.S. system) that will offer stronger signals in what is known as the L5 band (1176 MHz). That means more accurate map pinpoints compared to the original generation L1 band satellites, particularly in areas where line-of-sight can be obscured like urban areas. L5 was “designed to meet demanding requirements for safety-of-life transportation and other high-performance applications,” <a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/">as the U.S. government describes it</a>.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to put satellites into orbit (that’s the easy part!), and another to build power-efficient chips that can scan for these signals and triangulate a coordinate (that’s the hard part!). So far, chipmakers have focused on creating hybrid chips that pull from the L1 and L5 bands simultaneously. For example, Broadcom <a href="https://www.gpsworld.com/broadcoms-second-generation-dual-frequency-gnss-uses-l5-signals/">recently announced the second-generation of its hybrid chip</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://onenav.ai">OneNav</a> has a totally different opinion on product design, and it placed it right in its name. Eschewing the hybrid chip model of mixing old signals with new, it wants one chip monitoring the singular band of L5 signals to drive cost and power savings for devices. One nav to rule them all, as it were.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has closed a $21 million Series B round led by Karim Faris at GV, which is solely funded by Alphabet. Other investors included Matthew Howard at Norwest and GSR Ventures, which invested in earlier rounds of the company. All together, OneNav has raised $33 million in capital and was founded about two years ago.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Steve Poizner has been in the location business a long time. His previous company, SnapTrack, built out a GPS positioning technology for mobile devices that <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2000/03/02/qualcomm-completes-acquisition-wireless-location-leader-snaptrack">sold to Qualcomm for $1 billion in stock in March 2000</a>, at the height of the dot-com bubble. His co-founder and CTO at OneNav Paul McBurney has similarly spent decades in the GNSS space, most recently at Apple, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>They saw an opportunity to build a new navigation company as L5 band satellites have switched on in recent years. As they looked at the market and the L5 tech, they decided they wanted to go further than other companies by eliminating the legacy tech of older GPS technology and moving entirely into the future. By doing that, its design is “half the size of the old system, but much higher reliability and performance,” Poizner said. “We are aiming to get location technology into a much broader number of products.”</p>
<p>He differentiated between upgrading GPS from upgrading wireless signals. “With these L5 satellites, we don’t need the L1 satellites anymore [but] with 5G, you still need 4G,” he said. L5 band GPS does everything that earlier renditions did, but better, whereas with wireless technologies, they often need to complement each other to offer peak performance.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one caveat here: the L5 signal is still considered &#8220;pre-operational&#8221; by the U.S. government, since the U.S. GPS system only has 16 satellites broadcasting the signal today, and is targeting 24 satellites for full deployment by later in this decade. However, other countries have also deployed L5 GNSS satellites, which means that while it may not be fully operational from the U.S. government&#8217;s perspective, it may well be good enough for consumers.</p>
<p>OneNav’s goal according to Poizner is to be “the Arm of the GNSS space.” What he means is that like Arm, which produces the chip designs for nearly all mobile phones globally, OneNav creates comprehensive designs for L5 band GPS chips that can be integrated as a system-on-chip into the products of other manufacturers so that they can “embed a high-performance location engine based on their silicon.”</p>
<p>The company today also announced that its first design customer will be In-Q-Tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture capital and business development organization. Poizner said that through In-Q-Tel, “we now have a development contract with a U.S. government agency.” The company is expecting that its customer evaluation units will be completed by the end of this year with the objective of potentially having OneNav’s technology in end-user devices by late 2022.</p>
<p>Location tracking has become a major area of investment for venture capitalists, with companies working on a variety of technologies outside of GPS to offer additional detail and functionality where GPS falls short. Poizner sees these technologies as ultimately complementary to what he and his team are building at OneNav. “The better the GPS, the less pressure on these augmentation systems,” he said, while acknowledging that, “it is the case though that in certain environments [like downtown Manhattan or underground in a subway], you will never get the GPS to work.”</p>
<p>For Poizner, it’s a bit of a return to entrepreneurship. Prior to starting OneNav, he had been heavily involved in California state politics. Several years after the sale of SnapTrack to Qualcomm, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the California State Assembly. He later was elected California’s insurance commissioner in 2007 under former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He ran for governor in 2010, losing in the Republican primary against Meg Whitman, who made her name as the longtime head of eBay. He ran for his former seat of California insurance commissioner in 2018, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-steve-poizner-insurance-commissioner-independent-candidate-20180212-story.html">this time as a political independent</a>, but lost.</p>
<p>OneNav is based in Palo Alto and currently has more than 30 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life is complicated and so &#8212; increasingly &#8212; is work-life. That&#8217;s the premise underpinning <a href="https://www.polywork.com">Polywork</a>, a new professional social network founded by Lystable/Kalo founder, Peter Johnson.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s announcing a $3.5 million seed round today, led by by Caffeinated Capital&#8217;s Ray Tonsing (who it notes was the first investor in Clubhouse, Airtable and Brex), with participation from the founders of YouTube (Steve Chen), Twitch (Kevin Lin), PayPal (Max Levchin), VSCO (Joel Flory), Behance (Scott Belsky), and Worklife VC (Brianne Kimmel) &#8212; to name a few of its long list of angels.</p>
<p>As the list illustrates, Johnson, an ex-Googler (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/07/lystable-startup-battlefield/">TC battlefield alum</a>), isn&#8217;t short of contacts to tap up for his new startup &#8212; having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/lystable-takes-10m-top-up-to-tackle-freelancer-payments/">pulled so much VC</a> into Lystable/Kalo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Albeit we&#8217;ve also learned that his earlier startup, which was focused on tools to help companies manage freelancers and gig workers, is no longer active. Kalo/Lystable has hit the deadpool.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re told the founders took the decision to pull the plug after being unable to convince investors to keep supporting the business &#8212; which had, presumably, been severely impacted by the pandemic as companies laid off freelancers.</p>
<p>Although, in parallel, VC investment has been flowing into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/malt-raises-28-6-million-for-its-freelancer-platform/">startups</a> building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/worksome-pulls-13m-into-its-high-skill-freelancer-talent-platform/">marketplaces</a> to help companies work with external talent (as the remote work boom is clearly driving more flexible ways of working) so it&#8217;s not clear where exactly Kalo went wrong &#8212; perhaps its focus on management tools was simply being overtaken by more fully featured marketplaces which are baking in the kind of admin support its SaaS offered.</p>
<p>Lystable/Kalo had raised close to $30M over its seven year run, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kalo-hq">Crunchbase</a>, including from some of the same investors putting money into Polywork. Though most of the latter&#8217;s investors aren&#8217;t the same and look to be coming more from the social/entertainment side.</p>
<p>So what is Johnson&#8217;s new startup all about? It&#8217;s still focused on the world of work. It&#8217;s his &#8220;moonshot mission&#8221; &#8212; which, we&#8217;re told, has been fed by learnings gleaned from Lystable about creating a professional network.</p>
<p>But if you take a look at the site it&#8217;s a lot more Twitter in look and feel than LinkedIn. So the social element is really being put front and center here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155316" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155316" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155316" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bio-for-Richard-Fearn.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155316" class="wp-caption-text">A Polywork profile (Image credits: Polywork)</p></div></p>
<p>In short, Polywork sums to a Twitter-style social feed where professionals can post updates about what they&#8217;re up to (in work and, if they like, in life too).</p>
<p>Users skills and interests (e.g. &#8220;UX design&#8221;, &#8220;founder&#8221;, &#8220;dinosaur enthusiast&#8221;); personality quirks (&#8220;introvert&#8221;); and achievements (&#8220;life partner&#8221;) &#8212; or indeed the opposite (&#8220;bad golfer&#8221;, &#8220;failure&#8221;) &#8212; can be displayed as custom badges at the top of their profile &#8212; again with the chance to blend personal and professional to offer a fuller portrait of who you are and what you offer.</p>
<p>In the feed itself, individual posts can be given related tags (e.g. &#8220;conducted user research&#8221;, which files under &#8220;UX Design&#8221;) &#8212; to illustrate relevant activity. (Clicking on a specific badge shows the sliced view of that user&#8217;s related tagged content.)</p>
<p>The result is an interface that feels gamified and informal &#8212; where you&#8217;re actively encouraged to inject your own personality &#8212; but which is simultaneously intended for showing off work activity and achievements.</p>
<p>On the professional networking side, the approach allows users to get a quick visual overview of an individual &#8212; perhaps fleshing out some of the dry details they already saw on their LinkedIn account &#8212; and quickly navigate to individual examples of specific activity. Recruiters or others looking for professional ice-breakers will probably relish the chance to find more up-to-date material to work with, ahead of making a cold pitch.</p>
<p>Polywork also lets users send collaboration requests to others on the network &#8212; aka, its version of LinkedIn&#8217;s in-mail. But (thankfully) it looks like users have controls to set whether or not they&#8217;re open to receiving such requests or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly true that home and work have never been so blended as now, given the pandemic-fuelled remote work boom.</p>
<p>At the same time professionals may well &#8212; out of necessity &#8212; be more focused on the range of skills and interests they have or can acquire, rather than viewing any single job title as defining them, as was true for earlier generations of workers. As the saying goes, there&#8217;s no such thing as a &#8216;job for life&#8217; anymore. Careers paths are complicated, multi-faceted &#8212; and, for some, may be more a tapestry, than a linear trajectory.</p>
<p>Polywork&#8217;s Millennial-friendly premise is thus to offer a place where people can present a more personal and well-rounded flavor of themselves as professionals and individuals &#8212; encompassing not just their skills and work achievements but their passions, quirks and obsessions &#8212; showing off a lot more than feels possible (or sensible) in the staid environs of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>That said, LinkedIn isn&#8217;t the only place for professionals to express themselves of course; People are already doing that all the time over on social media sites like Twitter (or indeed Instagram for more visually minded professions). Either social network is basically already an informal professional network in its own right &#8212; without the need for badges or labels (hashtags do a fairly decent job).</p>
<p>So while Polywork&#8217;s product design may look inviting, trying to reinvent the networking wheel is undoubtedly a massive challenge.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not only fighting for attention with boring professional networks like LinkedIn (which everyone loves to hate), it&#8217;s treading directly into highly contested social media territory. Er, good luck with that! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Convincing people to duplicate their social networking activity &#8212; or indeed ditch their existing hard-won social media networks &#8212; looks like a big ask. </span>So the risk is irrelevance, despite a pretty interface. (Sure LinkedIn is boring &#8212; but, guys, the whole point is that it&#8217;s <em>low maintenance</em>&#8230; )</p>
<p>Polywork&#8217;s name and philosophy suggests it might be okay with being added to the existing mix of professional and social networks, i.e. rather than replacing either. But, well, a supplementary professional network sounds like a bit of a sideline.</p>
<p>Polywork launched in April but isn&#8217;t disclosing user numbers yet &#8212; and is currently operating a wait list for sign ups.</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement Caffeinated Capital&#8217;s Tonsing said: “There’s a new generation that wants to work and live on their own terms, not destined for a single track identity. The pandemic accelerated this trend and humans are reevaluating who they are and what&#8217;s most important to them in life. Polywork will usher in and facilitate this permanent shift in human behavior. We&#8217;re excited to partner with Peter again!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, the Audi spinoff that’s creating an in-vehicle XR passenger entertainment experience, is deploying blockchain technology and NFTs as the next stage in its preparation for a 2022 market launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which closed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 million Series A in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced it would be integrating Elrond blockchain into its tech stack to bring transparency to its ecosystem of car manufacturers and content creators. Holoride hopes to use NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, to incentivize developers into creating more content on holoride’s platform for the promise of more money earned off token purchases, and to attract passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain&#8230; NFTs&#8230; is holoride just trying to be internet trendy? Maybe, but the blockchain integration at least has been in the works for the past year, says holoride CEO and founder Nils Wollny.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride’s immersive in-vehicle media platform doesn’t need blockchain to function. Its passenger experiences sync to the real-time motion and location-based data of the vehicle, so content adjusts to vehicle motion (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/i-used-vr-in-a-car-going-90mph-and-didnt-get-sick/">meaning no motion sickness!</a>). Where blockchain plays a role is to help holoride fairly and transparently distribute content and compensate developers based on user engagement time and value distribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We said we want to connect all our ecosystem partners in a very fair and transparent manner from the beginning, and blockchain technology delivers exactly on that,” Wollny told TechCrunch. “Every transaction and engagement can be stored in the blockchain. For car manufacturers, they can see how much time was spent with holoride experiences in their cars, and for content creators it’s transparent on how much time was spent with their title they have created for our platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs are unique digital tokens that have a marked place on the blockchain and cannot be replaced with anything else. Most NFTs are part of Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain, but holoride’s will be supported by Elrond’s blockchain. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Audi spinoff holoride collects $12M in Series A led by Terranet AB&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/embed/#?secret=FuTaFMHued" data-secret="FuTaFMHued" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wollny hopes the enticement of buying or collecting NFTs while immersed in holoride’s experiences will lead to more engagement. He also anticipates the acceleration of what futurists and other tech nerds are calling the &#8216;metaverse&#8217; or the concept of the digital and virtual world increasingly intertwining with physical and augmented reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need help visualizing how this works while you’re strapped into a headset being driven to your next destination? For holoride, an NFT might start by connecting elements in the virtual world to locations or events in the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine people are traveling in their virtual vehicle, maybe it’s a spaceship or a submarine, as their physical body is in a car driving through the real world,” said Wollny. “They might pass by a certain location where a content creator decided to put something passengers can collect on their way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s kind of like Pokémon GO, but you’re sitting in a car with a VR headset on rather than walking around outside holding your phone in front of you and following augmented reality anime pets like a lunatic. And when you catch the Pokémon, it’s unique and yours and no one else can have it unless you decide to trade it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or maybe the user is really good at a game they’re playing and they earn rewards while playing,” Wollny continued. “You can maybe display them to other users or trade them in the future, bringing the real world and the virtual world closer together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of holoride’s NFTs really depends upon the extent to which passengers find themselves so immersed in their in-car experiences that they seek attachment and personalization in the form of digital tokens. Maybe Wollny has been spending too much time in virtual reality, or maybe he knows something we don’t about our inevitable reliance on extended reality. But as he told TechCrunch, this is only the genesis of the startup’s ecosystem, a step towards making holoride the “transportation company for the metaverse.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few months, we’ve seen an explosion in funding for consumer banking startups in Latin America, all eager to reinvent traditional banking in the region. However, the business banking space seems like it’s also undergoing some changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Chile-based <a href="https://www.kredito.cl/">Kredito</a> announced a $4 million pre-seed round. The company focuses on generating loans for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we see is that in our sector people have a bank account but don’t have access to credit,” said Sebastian Robles, co-founder and CEO of Kredito.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robles explained that in Chile, when you open a business bank account, you don’t get a credit or debit card attached to it, so entrepreneurs usually have to use their personal cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ninety percent of our customers don&#8217;t have access to credit with their bank (but they have a bank account) and thanks to the power of AI they can have access to working capital for the first time,” added Robles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using an AI algorithm to underwrite the loans in real time, Kredito does all the heavy lifting and then connects the SMBs with a traditional bank that loans out the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use proprietary algorithms and alternative data to evaluate credit risk more inclusively than traditional banks,” the company said in a statement. This approach speeds up the process of getting a loan, which traditionally has taken weeks or months to complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in beta, the company used data from more than 10,000 SMBs to train their AI models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kredito makes money by serving as lead generation for the traditional banks and charging them a small percentage for each loan they bring in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its loan service, Kredito is also developing a debit card product that will be available in the next couple of months. Like other fintechs in the region, the company’s strategy is to launch individual financial products one at a time without having to apply to be a full bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a bank is too expensive, so we use pieces of the ecosystem instead,” Robles told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kredito launched in March of this year and today the company has more than 2,000 active SMBs on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering new products, the company is very focused on offering optimal customer service, which is an area that traditional banks are lacking.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To open a bank account for our startup was more painful than raising our angel funds, and despite having $4 million in the bank, I still don’t have a line of credit for Kredito,” Robles said.</span></p>
<p>Investors in the round include a private VC fund from Maurice Khamis and Family, Link Capital Partners, partners from <a class="c-link" href="https://www.patio.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.patio.cl/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Patio Group</a>, Karim Fajardin and other family offices focused on VC and fintech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salespeople have more tools than ever these days to help them with their work, whether they are tools to source new leads, keep those leads interested or informed about what&#8217;s being sold, to track how the sales process is going, to manage those relationships once they are secured, or accounting tools to manage how and where sales are actually coming in. Today, a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help manage the data entry that powers all of that is announcing a swift round of funding to build on momentum and interest in its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a> &#8212; which has built a set of AI-based tools to automate the busywork that goes into updating data in sales software, specifically apps like Salesforce, in order to get the most out of that software &#8212; has closed $80 million in funding. Sources tell us that the money values the Vancouver-based startup at over $300 million.</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;swift&#8221; round in that efforts to raise and close the funding happened quickly, and come not two months after the company had announced a Series A and seed round totaling $20 million. (In fact, we got wind of this round a couple of weeks ago, so arguably it was less than two months since the previous announcement.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest Series B is being led by Spark Capital, with Greenspring, Tiger Global, Lachy Groom, boldstart ventures, BoxGroup and Addition also participating. Several of these are repeat investors.</p>
<p>Investor interest in the company is coming in part because of what Dooly is adding to the bigger mix of sales tools; and in part because of the traction it has already picked up for that.</p>
<p>While there are indeed a number of apps that salespeople can use these days, that has presented something of a predicament for many salespeople: tending to the data in each of these, updating records and helping them tick along, can be a very time-consuming task that takes people away from doing what they do best.</p>
<p>That predicament has perhaps been heightened in the last year, as organizations push for &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; investing in newer IT &#8212; to better adapt to workforces that are not in the office all the time, and in many cases haven&#8217;t been in an office together for a year and with some perhaps never to return again. That&#8217;s in many cases translated to using a ton more software to manage those people, what they do, and how they engage with each other when in-person is not an option.</p>
<p>Dooly&#8217;s proposition is that it uses AI tools like natural language processing to let people take notes on meetings and other work which it then intelligently can feed into other applications to let them work as they should.</p>
<p>Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s CEO himself experienced these pain points firsthand as a top salesperson for a number of other companies and this served as his motivation for building Dooly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was born out of pain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I was in a previous role as a top sales performer, I was constantly in this mode that eroded my time. The headwinds now are for remote working, but not everyone is benefitting from this remote world as much as Zoom is. Some are finding it harder to hit their numbers so you want to spend more time, not less, speaking to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">He describes his business as &#8220;the table cloth that goes over the table that no one wants to sit at&#8221; and more seriously, &#8220;a clean overlay to systems&#8221; that is very aware of the challenges salespeople face on a practical, operational level. &#8220;We are always mindful of thinking of workflows that hinder users from peak value mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>The the app, in his words, &#8220;plays nice&#8221; with a <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/product/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of services</a> both to ingest information &#8212; these, for example, include tools like Gong that among other things monitor voice-based sales calls to provide real-time feedback and transcripts), as well as those that are used to record what is going on, like Salesforce. It also integrates with Slack and G-Suite and other popular apps.</p>
<p>Then, in addition to being able to use and populate relevant data easily across multiple apps, Dooly also provides some guidance, based on the data it is seeing, to give suggestions on closing deals.</p>
<p>This is music to many salespeople&#8217;s ears, it seems. It now has some 500 businesses as customers, and says the list includes revenue teams at Asana, BigCommerce, Contentful, Figma, Intercom, Lessonly, and Procore, and more.</p>
<p>Up to now, the company has been growing organically, through word-of-mouth &#8212; which is perhaps the best kind of sales pitch and success that any company can hope for. Ironically, now that it&#8217;s model has been well proven out, it will quite possibly be using its own tools to expand its reach even more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Dooly</span> is building one of the most consequential enterprise companies of the next decade,” said Will Reed, a general partner at Spark Capital. “We are thrilled to support <span class="il">Dooly</span> as it continues to power the most forward-thinking revenue teams, and believe it will ultimately define the connected workspace category via its relentless focus on customers and product-led growth.&#8221; Reed is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumers are moving into investing to complement &#8212; or in some cases, offset &#8212; less good returns from things like traditional savings accounts with low interest rates or pensions, and today one of the bigger &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; in Europe helping to open up that opportunity is announcing a monster round of funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://traderepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic</a>, which lets people buy and sell shares, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives and (most recently) cryptocurrency by way of a mobile app that does not charge commissions (but does have a <a href="https://traderepublic.com/en-de/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fee structure for various services</a>), has raised $900 million in a Series C round of funding that values the Berlin startup at $5.3 billion, the startup confirmed.</p>
<p>The round has a very strong bench of investors behind it. It is being led by Sequoia, with new backers TCV and Thrive Capital, as well as previous backers Accel, Founders Fund, Creandum and Project A, also participating. Accel and Founders Fund co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic&#8217;s Series B a year ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment catapults the Berlin-based startup into being one of the biggest privately-held fintech businesses in the region, and while Trade Republic is currently only active in Germany, Austria and France, Christian Hecker (who co-founded the company with Marco Cancellieri and Thomas Pischke) said the startup will be using the funds to expand to many more countries (which will include not just sorting out licenses to do so, but implementing larger regional operations, hence the large round of funding).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our ambition to be present across the entire Eurozone in the next four months,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch. That might logically start with the biggest markets in the region, which would mean Spain and Italy, followed by Benelux, Ireland, and Finland.</p>
<p>Hecker&#8217;s view is that what Trade Republic provides is a resource that everyone should be able to access. &#8220;It really hurts me to see that the those demographic or macroeconomic factors [that are impacting users in Germany, France and Austria] are basically burning all continental European countries. So I think that&#8217;s really, really important we launch in all of those nations.&#8221; The UK is also on the target list, he noted, but Brexit has definitely thrown a proverbial spanner into the works on sorting that one out.</p>
<p>The turning tides of consumer habits, and economic trends, are indeed playing in favor of apps like Trade Republic that are giving people a crack at investing, an area of financial services that has traditionally been reserved for wealthier individuals with large sums of money and access to brokers to help them manage that.</p>
<p>For more ordinary people in Europe, interest rates have been at an all-time low, making traditional savings a less-compelling way of growing money; and given the rate of inflation, there are concerns that state pensions &#8212; Social Security, as it&#8217;s known in the U.S. &#8212; will not be enough for average consumers to live on in their later years without a supplement, while private pension plans are not widely used to supplement that already.</p>
<p>Enter &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; who are leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile apps, and a growing acceptance of carrying out financial services like payments or banking using them, to build a new approach to investing, one that is far more accessible to a wider pool of consumers by splitting the stock investing into increments or making way to invest in funds that are composites of many stocks; or indeed giving users a way of investing into alternative areas like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Or, as Hecker sums it up: &#8220;We have negative interest rates, and we have inflation, and we have a huge pension gap. All three factors demand that you need to do something for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has meant a massive shift in stock trading that has led to the rise of a number of new players.</p>
<p>They include Robinhood in the U.S. (which has tried but has yet to make a move into Europe); eToro, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in March</a> announced it was going public by way of a SPAC valuing it at $10 billion; Bux, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bux-a-european-robinhood-raises-80m-to-expand-its-neo-broker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $80 million</a> just last month; and neo-bank Revolut, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-limited-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides stock trading services</a>. It is also leading to the growth of completely new approaches to the concept, such as Rally creating a new market for investing in collectibles, and most recently NFTs to turn &#8220;everything&#8221; into an investible asset. Rally too <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005143/en/Rally-Raises-30-Million-Series-B-Led-by-Accel-To-Make-Everything-in-the-World-a-Tradable-Asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $30 million led by Accel this week</a>.</p>
<p>All those trends, and the wider rise of services to let you easily manage trades by smartphone app, has led to a huge boost for Trade Republic. Last year when announcing its Series B, Trade Republic said it had more than €1 billion under management. Now, that figure has ballooned to €6 billion, coming from just 1 million customers in the three markets where the startup is active: Germany, Austria and France.</p>
<p>Doing the math on that, customers on average are putting some €6,000 per account into Trade Republic, although in practice &#8212; and as a mark of the &#8220;democratization&#8221; that the company touts as part of its mass-market appeal &#8212; some are putting significantly less, and some significantly more, than that amount.</p>
<p>Hecker said that some users are earmarking as much as 20-30% of their salaries or savings on a monthly basis, and the idea is not so much about quick returns from quick trades, as it is about people looking longer-term gains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve never been a trading platform,&#8221; Hecker said, referring to the fact that many people tread their Trade Republic accounts as a savings plan. And for that reason, he wouldn&#8217;t really be drawn out on what kind of returns people could expect from the investments except to say that they are in line with how the general market provides gains, and would depend on what you invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s very exciting about being a savings plan is that it&#8217;s not only bound to short term returns,&#8221; he said, noting that a recent customer survey found that 70% of Trade Republic&#8217;s customers &#8220;are not looking for short-term gains, or investing with the sole purpose to benefit from the average buying effect.&#8221; Users, he said, &#8220;believe in trends, like sustainability, or the ability of the U.S. technology industry to really grow for the next 10 to 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding and valuation, and the story that the company likes to tell about its potential to help the average consumer have a better financial outcome with what money they have to hand, certainly seem to set up the startup to begin positioning itself as a more permanent part of the financial fabric, although as we have unfortunately seen, that can be a slippery idea not just in the world of financial services, but in the world of startups, too.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the fact that the company has a banking license comes in handy: it means that customers get deposit insurance of up to €100,000 per account (similar to how the FDIC backs banks in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Sequoia has been a strong investor in fintechs, backing the likes of Klarna and Nubank, and this comes as the firm is expanding its reach in the region after opening its first European office, in London.</p>
<p>“The democratization of financial markets will be one of the most important consumer trends of the next decade,&#8221; says Doug Leone, partner at Sequoia, in a statement. &#8220;Trade Republic is on the leading edge of this trend and has attracted an untapped generation of European savers who demand increased financial accessibility. We’re thrilled to partner with Christian, Thomas, Marco and their team as they deliver a product and experience that customers love.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments are going mainstream around the world. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 mobile money providers with over 100,000 active users, according to a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf">report</a> published by GSMA, an industry association for mobile network operators. Altogether, over 300 million mobile money accounts were active every month around the world.</p>
<p>Mobile money providers &#8212; more commonly known as e-wallets &#8212; are used to transfer money, pay and receive payments through mobile phones without the need for a traditional bank. They are useful so long as they enjoy wide adoption and a strong network effect. But even a popular service like Ant Groups&#8217;s Alipay, which has over one billion annual users, is practically unusable outside China due to its low penetration in most countries.</p>
<p>The problem is there is no interoperability between most wallets as there is between traditional banks, suggested Xue Zhixiang, who worked on the basic infrastructure for Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit and Alipay before starting <a href="https://walletsclub.com/">WalletsClub</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Registered in Hong Kong in 2019 with a small operational team in mainland China, WalletsClub sets its sights on becoming the Visa for digital wallets, making money transfers possible between the world&#8217;s hundreds of electronic money services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are like a clearinghouse for digital wallets,&#8221; said Xue, the company&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>A clearing system is an intermediary for two parties engaged in a financial transaction. It&#8217;s designed to ensure the efficiency and security of a transfer by validating the availability of the funds and logging the transfer between two transacting parties. Payments can be sent and received in real-time using WalletsClub, Xue claimed, and its technology is based on the &#8220;ISO 20022&#8221; standard, a common language for financial institutions to exchange data across the globe.</p>
<p>In other words, WalletsClub is going after the hundreds of e-wallets around the world rather than individual end-users. Its vision is to let people pay with any mobile wallet anywhere as long as the sender&#8217;s service provider or financial institution and the receiver&#8217;s equivalent services are members of WalletsClub, similar to how Visa and Mastercard process credit cards issued by different banks that are in their networks. The company plans to monetize by charging a flat fee per transaction.</p>
<p>By adding interoperability to electronic wallets, even small, regional players can thrive because they gain compatibility wherever a clearing system is in place.</p>
<p>Instead of challenging the traditional financial system, WalletsClub wants to provide a way for unbanked individuals to easily move money around through digital wallets, which are easier to obtain than a bank account. A big demand will come from overseas migrant workers who need to send money back to their home countries, such as the millions of Southeast Asian workers abroad.</p>
<p>WalletsClub is potentially encroaching on the territory of a few players. Expatriate workers sending money home currently revert to longstanding remittance services like Western Union or MoneyGram, which have large networks of &#8220;agent&#8221; locations where users go send or collect money. In 2018, Alipay began allowing users in Hong Kong to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180625005561/en/AlipayHK-and-GCash-Launch-Cross-Border-Remittance-Service-Powered-by-Alipay%E2%80%99s-Blockchain-Technology">send money to GCash accounts</a> in the Philippines, but &#8220;the focus of Ant Group is payments rather than remittance,&#8221; Xue observed.</p>
<p>In 2019, money sent home from diaspora workers became the largest source of external financing in low- and middle-income countries excluding China, <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/money-sent-home-workers-now-largest-source-external-financing-low-and-middle-income">according to World Bank data</a>. The money flows amounted to over $500 billion and surpassed the levels of foreign direct investment in these regions.</p>
<p>The other type of business that a clearinghouse for mobile wallets could threaten is cross-border payment aggregators, which save merchants from having to integrate with various digital payment methods.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge for the nascent startup is to establish trust with clients. At this stage, WalletsClub in talks with electronic money services founded by Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. Chinese-made wallets are especially plentiful in emerging markets, thanks to these founders&#8217; learning from China&#8217;s fintech boom over the decade. Many of them found it hard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">compete with behemoths like Tencent and Ant</a>, let alone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">China&#8217;s tightening regulations around fintech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we reach 20 members and have several hundreds of transactions between every pair of members on a daily basis, we are basically profitable,&#8221; said Xue, adding that the goal is to onboard a dozen customers by this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We live in a world where companies have to send out ‘gifts’ to individuals. Chocolate bars. Bottles of wine. You name it. Companies are gifting it. But right now, that operation is buried in a marketing department on a spreadsheet, as is mostly pretty disorganized.</p>
<p>A handful of startups realized it could be done better and at scale, among them Sendoso (which has raised $52.7M) and ReachDesk ($6M).</p>
<p>Joining this clan is a startup with the tortuous name of “&amp;Open” (yes, ‘ampersand open’, pronounced ‘And Open’ for those of you at the back).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suffice it to say, that despite its name it’s raised $7.2 million to makes it easier for brands to send carefully gifts to customers to boost loyalty and engagement. First Round Capital and LocalGlobe led the Seed round along with participation from angel investors including Andrew Robb (Farfetch), Des Traynor (Intercom) and Liam Casey (PCH). The funds will be used to scale to Europe and the US. Currently &amp;Open claims to deliver more than 3,500 gifts every week.</p>
<p>Dublin-based &amp;Open launched in 2017 and was founded by Ciara Flood, formerly buyer at Net-a-Porter and part of the founding team at Mr Porter, together with her husband Jonathan Legge, and her and brother-in-law, Mark Legge. The brothers previously founded the high-end gift and homeware venture Makers &amp; Brothers.</p>
<p>&amp;Open (please God, take me now&#8230;) counts Airbnb, Spotify, and Peloton among their customers.</p>
<p>Gifting can be powerful. According to one <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-retail-study-shows-marketers-under-leverage-emotional-connection-300720049.html">study</a> which the company cites, customers who feel emotionally connected to a brand have been shown to create a 306% higher lifetime value. This is in stark contrast to existing, traditional Meanwhile, Schemes like corporate gifts, branded merchandise, loyalty programmes, and vouchers <a href="https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Forrester-Future-of-CX.pdf">don’t work</a>, claims &amp;Open.</p>
<p>Jonathan Legge said: “Customers will choose brands who prioritize care and connection over transactional relationships. A thoughtful gift can make all the difference — both for a customer’s experience and their advocacy and loyalty to a brand.”</p>
<p>Hayley Barna, Partner at First Round Capital, said: “Gone are the days of relying on a points-based loyalty scheme to keep your customers engaged and happy. Brands increasingly need to work harder to retain customers and &amp;Open provides an elegant solution to this conundrum.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cervest.earth/">Cervest</a> &#8211; a startup with a platform that claims to quantify climate risk across multiple decades and threats down to the asset level &#8211; has raised a  $30 million Series A round led by Draper Esprit. Previous investors Astanor Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital (Chris Sacca), and Future Positive Capital also participated in the round, and were joined by new investors UNTITLED, the venture fund of Magnus Rausing, and TIME Ventures, the venture fund of Marc Benioff. Cervest’s total funding now stands at $36.2 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/cervest-raises-3-7m-for-earth-science-ai-platform-to-predict-climate-effects/">previously</a> raised $5.2M in 2019.</p>
<p>Cervest’s competitors include Jupiter Intelligence, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jupiter-intelligence">raised</a> $35M to Series B level,  but Cervest claims it has a more data + AI approach.</p>
<p>The company will use the new funding to expand in the U.S. and European markets through its freemium model<br />
It’s widely accepted now, with unpredictable weather patterns and clear climate “weirding” that these weather events are of huge risk to trillions of dollars of physical assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cervest says its &#8220;Climate Intelligence” platform has been built through peer-reviewed research over the five years and combines public and private data sources (i.e. NOAA, ECMWF, CMIP6), machine learning, and statistical science to come up with a view of climate risks to assets.</p>
<p>&#8216;EarthScan&#8217; will be its first product, giving enterprises and governments a view on how flooding, droughts, and extreme temperatures can impact the assets they own or manage,going back 50 years and looking forward 80 years.</p>
<p>Iggy Bassi, Founder and CEO of Cervest said: &#8220;Climate Intelligence is Business Intelligence for managing climate risk. Climate volatility has thrown us into a new era where Climate Intelligence needs to be integrated into all decisions. Organizations that fail to do so risk being blindsided by climate events such as the recent floods and fires in Australia, the droughts in Europe, and the winter freeze in Texas. Much of the spotlight is on decarbonization today. While this is absolutely necessary, it is not sufficient to build asset-level resilience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vinoth Jayakumar, Partner and Fintech Practice Lead at Draper Esprit added: &#8220;Climate Tech has grabbed a lot of attention recently, with good reason… Cervest&#8217;s pioneering approach to quantifying risk, in a way that was never before possible, means we can better understand the economics of the problem and bring real-world market solutions to bear.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy US startup Pipe — which claims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue” — has just raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation? The secret for the hype? It gives SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by &#8220;pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts&#8221;, as my colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Mary Ann Azevedo so eloquently put it</a>.</p>
<p>Virtually the same model is about to hit Europe in various guises, and the newest of the crop will be  <a href="https://www.weareuncapped.com/">Uncapped</a>, a London-based startup that plans to extend the model not just to SaaS companies but also to the booming sector of E-commerce.</p>
<p>It’s now raised an $80 million combined funding round of debt and equity to launch a suite of banking services tailored to the needs of this new wave of tech-driven companies. The round was led by Lakestar. Uncapped’s previous investors include All Iron Ventures, White Star Capital, Global Founders Capital, and Mouro Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to use the cash to move into the banking space, with new products and services. Last year, the company began issuing Visa cards.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Uncapped is positioned as an alternative to traditional debt financing and venture capital, providing companies with growth finance for a flat fee which goes down to 6%, and fast-released capital. Businesses repay the capital as they make revenue. There is no set repayment and no compounding interest, equity, or personal guarantees. There are even no credit checks or business plans required.</p>
<p>Uncapped arrives at an opportune moment. The pandemic has led to an e-commerce boom, but the sector requires much more capital than existing VCs can provide. Legacy banks don’t ‘get&#8217; new entrepreneurs. Neo Banks are trying to provide it, but can still be slow.</p>
<p>Piotr Pisarz, Co-Founder of Uncapped, said: “Digital companies are innovating and evolving faster than ever before, but their legacy banking providers are not keeping up with the pace. We want to help digital entrepreneurs with quick access to funding, insights that help their business grow, rewards they actually care about, and modern integrations that will save them time and money.”</p>
<p>“The reality is that legacy banks don’t really understand the needs of digital entrepreneurs, and their dated infrastructure is not up to the standards required to help their business grow. So it’s no surprise that 82% of business owners say they are unhappy with their bank,” Asher Ismail, Co-Founder of Uncapped, added.</p>
<p>Nicolas Brand, Partner at Lakestar, said: “The composition of our economies is changing, with digital native businesses contributing an ever-increasing share to overall GDP. Uncapped uses real-time data provided by its clients across APIs to offer bespoke credit and other novel banking services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, better known as a VC which, in its time, has backed the likes of Digg, launchrock, Meero, Summly, and Tier, among others, is moving into the hot world of crypto and blockchain with a new $50M Digital Asset Fund.</p>
<p>The special-vehicle fund will specialize in investing in crypto-networks and blockchain-enabled businesses and was previously going to be $30 million before raising more backing. Both Bpifrance and Ubisoft are among those institutions backing the new fund.</p>
<p>The fund will be run by New York-based General Partner Sep Alavi and supported by Principals Thomas Klocanas in New York and Sanjay Zimmerman in Toronto. The will deploy between $500,000 and $3.0 million in initial investments into 15-20 companies with a focus on North America and Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alavi said: “We are hyper-focused on this space and we expect to see further innovative use cases such as crypto credit, DeFi, NFTs, metaverses and more manifesting at an accelerated pace… With this fund, We are actively investing in crypto protocols, infrastructure, privacy, financial, gaming, and social use cases.”</p>
<p>The fund has already made six investments including; dfuse, Multis, Paraswap, Rally, Safello, a European crypto brokerage that went public on the Nasdaq First North stock exchange on May 12, and Ledn, a global digital asset savings, and credit platform.</p>
<p>Yoann Caujolle, managing director of Bpifrance said: &#8220;It’s critical that emerging crypto and blockchain-enabled startups receive investment from firms and professionals who have the experience and knowledge to help drive their businesses forward,” said “We’re pleased to partner with the Digital Asset Fund team for bringing their support and vision into the French and European blockchain and digital asset ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Over a call, Alavi told me: “White Star is investing across three funds, obviously our fund one, fund two, and in this new specialized Digital Asset Fund. Historically we&#8217;ve invested in enterprise and consumer businesses, we’ve not done any, any blockchain, but for two years ago we&#8217;ve been looking at this sector. And we believe that this merits its own dedicated vehicle. I&#8217;ve been personally been investing in blockchain the blockchain ecosystem since 2015 and bring your five-plus years of domain expertise and then I was able to build a team around this new fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, we&#8217;re looking at the three main verticals in this sector. The protocol layer, the infrastructure layer, and the application layer. That&#8217;s the kind of high-level thesis. The protocol layer is where we invest in tokens, because it’s important to mention that the fund will also hold tokens as investments as well as equity. On top of that, we&#8217;re pretty much agnostic and opportunistic. We see great use cases in decentralized finance. We see some great use cases in the NFT space and have made investments there as well. As long as we&#8217;re true to those three verticals that I mentioned, we will capture great value there.”</p>

To add to that mix for longer journeys, today a startup that&#8217;s building a new take on car rental is announcing some funding to scale out its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.govirtuo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtuo</a>, a Paris-based startup that has built a very streamlined, all-digital approach for those who want to rent a car for a few days, or up to a few months, has picked up $96 million, money that it will be using to invest in its tech; to expand to more markets beyond France (12 cities including Paris), UK (London, Manchester and Edinburgh) and Spain (Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia); to add in a tier for business users; and to add more vehicles into the mix. The company currently has 150,000 active users, and grew 100% (2x) this last year, said co-founder Karim Kaddoura.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of the &#8216;staycation&#8217; boosted our business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we saw a surge in the average duration of a rental.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All-digital and streamlined in the case of Virtuo means exactly that: currently there are only two models to choose from outside of France &#8212; either a Mercedes Benz A-Class or a Mercedes GLA SUV &#8212; but there is no paperwork, with everything handled through an app, and you have the option of getting a car delivered to and picked up from you, meaning no lines in airports or hotel garages, and you get a virtual key to operate it.</p>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a $60 million Series C and $36 million in asset financing. AXA Venture Partners, the strategic investment arm of the insurance giant, led the equity round, with new investors Bpifrance, Alpha Intelligence Capital and H14; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/virtuo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous backers</a> Balderton Capital, Iris Capital and Raise Ventures, also participating. Natixis, members of Banque Populaire and Caisse d&#8217;Epargne Group handled the asset financing.</p>
<p>While companies like Zipcar, Getaround or Turo (which has, interestingly acquired Virtuo as a Google search, and even writes &#8220;Virtuo&#8221; on its search resultshave made it easy to rent cars for a day or as little as a few hours in cities, Virtuo provides a modern take on the more traditional use case for renting cars: when you need a vehicle for longer journeys that can take up to several days, and specifically in the case of Virtuo between one and 90 days.</p>
<p>As Kaddoura &#8212; who co-founded Virtuo with Thibault Chassagne &#8212; notes, traditional car rental companies serving that market are typically still pretty rigid with how they do things.</p>
<p>Even if you initiate a process online, there is usually still paperwork that needs to be filled out in person; and you need to go to a rental hub &#8212; in an airport or a hotel, but not necessarily in your neighborhood &#8212; to pick up the car. The process for checking them out and in can also be tedious and the costs for all of this quite high, with many moments where the rental company might upsell you to make a basic price suddenly quite premium.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car rental industry itself is huge but consumers in it are completely underserved,&#8221; Kaddoura said.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the equation, there is a growing case for not owning a car if you live in a city or large town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aha-moment was when we looked into the numbers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In Paris, there are 700,000 cars parked in the streets, with twice that in London. The average European spends €7,500 per car per year when you calculate parking, insurance, damage, taxes, and the price of the car averaged out. That&#8217;s €5 billion spent by Parisians, yet those cars are idle 95% of the time. Forget the financial part and look at the impact cars have on our lives and livelihoods, occupying 50% of our urban space.&#8221; It&#8217;s all the more ironic, Kaddoura noted, given that his father is a car dealer who completely expected his son to go into business with him one day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly because of this environmental angle that Virtuo is also going to be expanding its fleet to include more electric vehicles: it already inludes Hyundai&#8217;s Kona Electric vehicles in its fleets in France, and the plan is to expand to have 50% of its fleet electrified by 2025, with 100% of it covered by electric vehicles by 2030. It also has been offsetting 100% of its carbon footprint since January of this year.</p>
<p>The funding round being announced today comes after what has been a challenging period for any company with a business model predicated on people leaving their homes to do things, not least to do things in spaces others have recently occupied. That is to say, Covid-19 has encourage people to stay home and socially distance, so a car rental &#8212; which encourages travel and specifically travel in a vehicle someone else has been in &#8212; may be a challenging sell.</p>
<p>Although revenues grew in 2020, it&#8217;s perhaps partly because of the bigger market conditions that Virtuo somewhat slowed down its roll. When we covered its last round of funding, in 2019, the company said the money would be used to expand to Spain and Germany, and more markets in the UK, that year, and it was also live in Belgium. Now, Kaddoura confirms that now Germany will only be coming online in 2022. Milan will be as soon as later this month, he said, with the bigger plan being to be live in 10 countries by 2025. (And Belgium is no longer online, it seems.)</p>
<p>Added to its own scaling ambitions, however, the opportunity that Virtuo is targeting is not one that others have ignored. In addition to others like Getaround (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a big round</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drover</a> out of the UK, Zipcar and Turo providing more streamlined rental and car-sharing experiences, recently Uber also <a href="https://www.cartrawler.com/ct/company-news/cartrawler-partners-with-uber-to-expand-car-rentals-with-uber-rent-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded a car rental offering in partnership</a> with a third party called CarTrawler. This is not a fully integrated service like Virtuo&#8217;s, nor a peer-to-peer offering like Getaround, but something that appears to aggregate and search across the same traditional car rental companies that Virtuo is competing against. That makes it, potentially, a direct competitor.</p>
<p>“We are very proud and excited to be part of the Virtuo adventure alongside the Virtuo team, led by Karim and Thibault,” said Benoit Fosseprez, general partner at AXA Venture Partners, in a statement. “Virtuo has quickly become a tech leader disrupting the car rental space, with a clear long-term vision and strong ambitions for growth into new markets. We have been impressed by the Virtuo team and look forward to working closely together on the next stages of their development. With this investment in Virtuo, the first for our Growth II fund, we are confirming our ambition in the tech-led high growth companies segment.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Virtuo in its development,&#8221; said Caroline Lebel of Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund, in a separate statement. &#8220;The company offers a true alternative to owning private cars for city dwellers who wish to use more sustainable shared mobility solutions. Born in the digital era, Virtuo’s 100% digital experience is backed by powerful technology and artificial intelligence to optimize its operations. We are convinced that the mobility of tomorrow must be built with strong technology at its core, addressing new behaviors and with the freedom of choice of a multimodal offer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The real estate market in South Korea is very fragmented, which means people often have to work with dozens of brokers before they find a new home. Founded in 2020 by a former WeWork executive, <a href="https://www.dongnae.com/">Dongnae</a> wants to create a centralized base for brokers, serving as a multiple listing system (MLS). Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/dongnae-raises-4-1-million-to-digitize-real-estate-in-south-korea/">first seed round</a> last year, Dongnae has increased its brokerage partners to more than 70. Today the startup announced it has raised a seed extension of $4.1 million, doubling its total raised to $8.2 million.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by investment fund NFX, with participation from returning investors Flybridge and MetaProp, who led Dongnae’s first seed round. NFX general partner Pete Flint, who co-founded Trulia and is a former Zillow board member, will join Dongnae’s board. The startup’s other investors include Goodwater Capital, Maple VC and strategic angel investors in South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting time of growth at our company, and we want to make sure that we are executing our go-to-market plan,” founder Matthew Shampine, who formerly ran WeWork Asia, told TechCrunch about the seed extension. “Pete Flint and [principal] Brittany Yoon at NFX bring an amazing combination of real estate expertise and Korean startup experience that will be invaluable to Dongnae.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Dongnae also announced the release of its Android app today. The company’s Android and iOS apps let potential renters and buyers look at listings and book tours of properties in the Seoul metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Shampine said that Dongnae now has more than 8,000 listings. Since its last funding announcement five months ago, Dongnae has increased its closed deal volume by more than 65% and revenue by 150%.</p>
<p>Shampine added that the new funding will be used to grow Dongnae’s brokerage network across the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for almost half of South Korea’s population, and the development of its technology and brokerage teams.</p>
<p>“At the time of our seed funding, we had just launched our brokerage partner program so we actually had one partner. The name of our first partner is Global Real Estate, based in Yongsan, and they were actually the brokerage that helped me find my personal apartment around the time we started Dongnae,” said Shampine. “They’ve been a wonderful and patient partner as our organization has grown this year, and we’ve already worked together to help a number of our customers find great homes.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Flint said, “The executive team at Dongnae is uniquely qualified considering their global backgrounds and deep local real estate expertise, and I believe the timing is perfect for Dongnae and the market need they are addressing in Korea.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zhang Yiming, the storied co-founder of ByteDance, is stepping down from his role as the CEO and passing the torch to Liang Rubo, another co-founder of the TikTok parent and one of the world&#8217;s most valuable internet juggernauts.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://bytedance.com/en/news/60a526af053cc102d640c061">internal letter</a> to employees, 38-year-old age Zhang said he is making the transition to spend more time on &#8220;long-term strategy, corporate culture, and social responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang will work side by side with Liang, currently ByteDance&#8217;s head of human resources and his college classmate, over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition. Zhang will remain as a member of the board at ByteDance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the sound of the letter, Zhang reminisces about the period between college and starting ByteDance in 2012 when he spent ample time thinking about the future. That led him to conclude that machine learning would revolutionize the way people encountered information and the idea laid the foundation for ByteDance’s algorithm-driven content distributors such as Toutiao and TikTok. But acting as a CEO, he said, he was preoccupied with “listening to presentations, handling approvals, and making decisions reactively.”</p>
<p>“Innovation and success are rooted in years of exploring and imagining what is possible. However, few people have real insight into the future, preferring to model on current and past achievements,” the founder wrote, citing American tech giants as role models.</p>
<p>“People are amazed by the success of electric cars, but they forget that Tesla is 18 years old and first experimented with laptop batteries to power its vehicles. People know about Apple&#8217;s software management tool HomeBrew, but few realize that computer geeks were discussing the Apple I in the HomeBrew Club in the 1970s.”</p>
<p>Zhang also recognized that he’s not the ideal manager type, saying he’s “more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles, and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work, rather than actually managing people.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, I&#8217;m not very social, preferring solitary activities like being online, reading, listening to music, and daydreaming about what may be possible.”</p>
<p>Liang appears to be a better fit for wearing the CEO hat for his experience leading R&amp;D and Lark, which started as an internal work collaboration tool and later evolved into a full-flung SaaS product sold to other enterprises.</p>
<p>Another high-profile Chinese tech boss who recently resigned from day-to-day operations was Colin Huang, founder of Alibaba’s arch rival Pinduoduo. Huang took a step back so he could allocate his energy to food and life sciences, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">areas that the e-commerce firm hopes could fuel its future growth</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of a pickup truck is not all about torque, horsepower, towing and hauling. Ford’s newest electric F-150 Lightning, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">unveiled Wednesday</a>, is trying to change the meaning of truck power with a system that can provide energy to a customer&#8217;s home in the event of an outage.</span></p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t alone in its effort to show consumers the benefits of an all-electric vehicle. Others, such as Lucid Motors have also touted this capability.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe winter storms in February caused a massive power outage in Texas, with more than 4.5 million homes and businesses left without power for days. 151 people were killed as a result. The F-150 Lightning&#8217;s 9.6 kW of Back Up Power can provide full home power for up to three days on a full charge of battery.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your F-150 Lightning is plugged in when your outage occurs, intelligent backup power will automatically kick in to power your home,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s energy services lead, in a video briefing prior to the reveal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When power is restored, the truck automatically reverts to charging its battery.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar, battery storage and energy services provider Sunrun has partnered with Ford to install the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and home integration system, which comes standard with the extended range battery, to power the intelligent backup power system. While they’re in the neighborhood, Sunrun will also give customers the option of installing a solar and battery system for their home. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155195" style="width: 8810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2155195 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg" alt="Ford F-150 EV lightning" width="8800" height="4950" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg 8800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8800px) 100vw, 8800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2155195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who want to spend time away from home, an additional 9.6 kW Pro Power Onboard battery source, which is up from 7.2kW in the F-150 hybrid, can power anything from loudspeakers and TVs to electric dirt bikes, circular saws and jackhammers. The truck features 11 outlets in the bed, the cabin interior and the mega power “frunk” AKA front trunk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery also distributes power intelligently. So if a driver is at a worksite powering tools and the battery level falls below a third of its total range, the driver will get a notification so they can decide if they want to keep at it or save the juice for driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers also don’t need to think too much about where the nearest charging station is. They can set it and forget it, letting the truck handle switching off pro power onboard if the battery level approaches the distance it takes to get to the nearest charge. Charge information both for the Back Up Power and the Pro Power are reflected on the Ford app and the car&#8217;s infotainment screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the F-150 Lightning currently can give your home the backup power it needs, in the future, the aim is for subsequent models to be used as a home management tool, according to a Ford spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-150 Lightning is reinventing the idea of vehicle power,” said O’Gorman.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Ford F-150, the profitable cornerstone of the U.S. automaker&#8217;s business, now has an all-electric sibling.</p>
<p>Ford unveiled Wednesday the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric pickup truck that is a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $22 billion investment into electrification. The vehicle is one of a trifecta of Ford EV debuts and launches in the past year. And it is possibly the most meaningful in terms of the bottom line. The Ford F-150 Lightning, which will be built at the automaker&#8217;s Rouge factory in Dearborn, Michigan, follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and the E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers.</p>
<p>Ford had a challenging gig with the F-150 Lightning. The truck would need everything that has made its gas-powered counterpart the best-selling vehicle in North America as well as new benefits that come from going electric. That means torque, performance, towing capability and the general layout has to meet the needs of its customers, many of whom use it for commercial purposes. The vehicle specs suggest that Ford has delivered on the torque and power, while keeping the same cab and bed dimensions as its gas counterpart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last detail is notable because by keeping the same dimensions, it is able to accommodate the thousands of F-150 truck accessories that exist today. If Ford has any hope of converting its current customer base, decisions like this one matter. It should be noted that, for now, the Lightning is only offered as a Supercrew four-door with a 5.5-foot bed.</p>
<p>Will it convert or will the F-150 Lightning attract a whole new group of customers? It&#8217;s a question that won&#8217;t be answered until it comes to market in spring 2022.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe the Lightning has the makings to be a hit for Ford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ford went well beyond installing a battery pack in a traditional F-150,&#8221; iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer said. &#8220;The automaker&#8217;s comprehensive approach to the Lightning&#8217;s design, performance, and advanced features would make it a desirable truck with a traditional engine. The electric powertrain, and the instant torque and increased cargo and towing capacity that come with it, along with the ability to seamlessly power a house for multiple days, are additional benefits beyond the Lightning&#8217;s sleek styling, rapid acceleration, and high-tech amenities. It&#8217;s obvious Ford recognizes both the opportunity and risk presented by the shift toward electric vehicles, and the automaker has clearly committed to keeping the F-150 viable in a battery-powered world.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="width: 2160px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2155171-1" width="2160" height="2160" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will be offered in four trims, which includes the base, XLT, Lariat and Platinum series, and two battery options. The truck, which has an aluminum alloy body, is powered by two in-board electric motors, comes standard with four-wheel drive, and has an independent rear suspension. Ford is only releasing two prices at the moment. The base version will be priced at $39,974 before any federal or state tax credits, while the mid-series XLT model will start at $52,974. According to the reservations site, a fully loaded Lightning will go for $90,474. All of these prices exclude the destination fees and taxes.</p>
<p>The overall length of the standard-range battery model (specs from other trims are yet to be published) is 232.7 inches, one inch longer than the gas-powered F-150. The Lightning&#8217;s wheelbase is essentially the same, with just one-tenth of an inch separating it from its combustion engine and hybrid cousins.</p>
<p>One notable difference between the electric and gas 4&#215;4 versions of the F-150 is the ground clearance. The Lightning has ground clearance of 8.9 inches compared to 9.4 in the original F-150. That half-inch loss is possibly caused by the metal skid plates that are meant to protect the battery and inboard motors from the terrain.</p>
<p>The standard battery range truck delivers a targeted 426 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque. The F-150 Lightning equipped with the extended-range battery helps push the horsepower to 563 (or 420 kW) and has the same torque, which Ford says is the most of any F-150 ever.</p>
<p>The vehicle&#8217;s battery has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and pops up to 300 miles in the extended version. One question remains: how will the range be affected by towing a boat or trailer?</p>
<p>Ford doesn&#8217;t provide that information, and until the EPA gives its estimated range and people start towing cars, boats and snowmobiles, it might not clear.</p>
<p>Ford does point to two features meant to help drivers understand just how far they can travel before charging. The first is called &#8220;onboard scales,&#8221; which uses sensors on the truck to estimate payload so drivers know the weight of what they&#8217;re hauling. Now, payload &#8212; the weight a truck can carry &#8212; is different from towing capacity, which is the weight it can tow. But &#8220;onboard scales&#8221; work alongside yet another feature called &#8220;intelligent range,&#8221; which takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather and more, according to Ford.</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t backing away from payload and towing capacity. Ford notes that the new frame on the truck uses the strongest steel ever put in an F-150 frame and supports a maximum 2,000-pound payload and up to 10,000-pound towing capacity.</p>
<h2>Inside the Lightning</h2>
<p>Just like the newly refreshed gas-powered F-150, the Lightning is filled with connected car tech and advanced driving assistance features. The higher level trims of the Lightning — the Lariat and Platinum versions — will come with Ford&#8217;s Sync 4A infotainment system that can support over-the-air software updates. That means the system rollout upgrades to the vehicle, such as adding or improving driver assistance features and keeping maps up to date. SYNC 4 will offer third-party apps through its AppLink system, including Waze and a version of Amazon&#8217;s Alexa called Ford+Alexa.</p>
<p>The Sync 4A system, which will feature natural voice control and real time mapping, will be displayed on a 15.5-inch touchscreen that looks a lot like what is inside the new Mustang Mach-E electric crossover. In front of the driver is a 12-inch instrument cluster that can be customized. This digital cluster will also relay important information to the driver on how the battery is operating, the regenerative braking and the advanced driver assistance system functions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is the smartest F-150 we&#8217;ve ever made,&#8221; said Darren Palmer, general manager of battery electric vehicles at Ford Motor Company. &#8220;F-150 Lightning offers an immersive touch screen,<br />
giving our customers all the info they want in an instant &#8212; a real-time view of where they&#8217;re going, what they&#8217;re hauling or how much real-world range they&#8217;ve got banked. And with Ford<br />
Power-Up software updates, the experience is only going to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will also offer Blue Cruise, the automaker&#8217;s new hands-free driving feature, which will also be available on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. That hands-free capability &#8212; which uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition &#8212; has undergone some 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford emphasized in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">announcement in April</a>. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p>The hands-free system will be available on vehicles equipped with Ford&#8217;s Co-Pilot360 Technology and will only work on certain sections of divided highways. The system, which will be rolled out via software updates later this year, will initially be available on more than 100,000 miles of highways in North America.</p>
<h2>Charging and power</h2>
<p>Charging is of course critical to driving any electric vehicle. But it isn&#8217;t just about having the ability to plug in. Communicating how, when and where is the crux. Ford said customers will receive a<br />
notification if their truck&#8217;s battery falls below one-third of its total range. The intelligent range, which as noted above takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather, is also communicated to the driver. The accompanying FordPass app also gives customers information on charging locations. Inside the vehicle, a driver can use the infotainment system to identify and navigate to charging stations.</p>
<p>The truck also has onboard power source, which in the standard trim offers 2.4 kilowatts of power while Lariat and Platinum series come standard with 9.6 kilowatts of power — a combination of up to 2.4 kilowatts available through the truck&#8217;s so-called &#8220;mega power frunk&#8221; and up to 7.2 kilowatts through outlets in the cab and bed.</p>
<p>Ford also touted its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9.6 kW of back up power, which it says can provide energy to a home during a blackout for three days and as many as 10 with rationing. </span></p>

Which is very hype.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We’re shaking things up today and talking about product first and venture capital rounds second. Sound good?</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/otter-ais-new-assistant-can-automatically-transcribe-your-zoom-meetings/"><strong>Otter.ai’s</strong> new product: Otter Assistant</a>. It can transcribe your <strong>Zoom</strong> calls. For reporters, this is <em>huge</em> as a note-taking tool. But it will likely find even broader remit in the business world. Don’t forget that Otter raised $50 million just a few months ago. (For more on the voice transcription space, check out <strong>Deepgram’s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/deepgram-raises-12m-for-enterprise-speech-recognition/">2020-era funding round.</a>)</p>
<p>Second in the product category, <strong>Liquid Instruments</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/liquid-instruments-raises-13-7m-to-bring-its-education-focused-8-in-1-engineering-gadget-to-market/">raised $13.7 million</a> to bring its <strong>Moku:Go</strong> product to classrooms and labs everywhere. What does the Go do? It “combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface,” TechCrunch reported.</p>
<p>Moving onto some purely financial coverage from startup-land, here are four neat rounds we dug into more deeply:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/construction-tech-startup-assignar-raises-20m-in-fifth-wall-led-series-b/"><strong>$20M for Assignar</strong></a>: Construction tech is a busy sector, not merely because the construction sector is itself rather active; the digital transformation push that we’ve seen around the business is also touching down in the world of mortar and bricks. Its software helps contractors and subcontractors “connect to the field and vice versa,” according to its CEO Sean McCreanor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Fellow construction tech player <strong>Procore</strong> is going public as we speak. So the market that Assignar is playing in is active in both early- and late-stage terms.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/formlabs-raises-150m/"><strong>$150M for Formlabs</strong></a>: 3D printing has come of age, it appears, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs closed a nine-figure round for its printing tech. SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the round, which values the company at around $2 billion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Formlabs wants to improve 3D printing machines while also making them cheaper. If it can pull that off, whole sectors could be shaken up.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/super-raises-50m-to-cover-home-repairs-and-maintenance-via-a-subscription-model/"><strong>$50M for Super</strong></a>: If you own a home, you are familiar with how rapidly entropy will ensure that you have a regular stream of repair bills. Why not convert those into a monthly subscription? That’s what Super is working to do, and now it has cash to pursue its vision after growing 7x since last April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care</em></strong><em><strong>?</strong> The subscription push is far more than merely an enterprise-software affair, or something related to consumer entertainment. Anything as a service is where we are in 2021.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/"><strong>$250M for Pipe</strong></a>: Pipe is a platform that allows companies to sell their future, predictable revenue streams to investors. It’s best known for working with SaaS companies, but is expanding into other business types as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Pipe has been growing at a torrid pace, and raising capital at a similar clip. It’s either onto something super huge, or the market for financial products is just bonkers for now. Either way, it’s an interesting option for software startups hunting for cash.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>5 innovative fundraising methods for emerging VCs and PEs</h2>
<p>According to David Teten, founder of Versatile VC, five new strategies are gaining traction among fund managers looking to raise capital from family offices and high-net-worth individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities and virtual events.</li>
<li>Platforms that help other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Soliciting under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launching a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfunding from retail investors into a general partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a summary of a class he taught for the Oper8r VC fund accelerator, Teten offers actionable advice for anyone who wants to connect with pre-qualified investors.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today from the world of Big Tech, we’re pausing to listen to our own Editor in Chief <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Matthew Panzarino</a> discuss the new iPad Pro, which he thinks has amazing hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen:</strong> “The mini-LED-driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that’s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It’s just fantastic.”</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> “The M1 chip is absolutely blistering.”</li>
<li><strong>Imaging: </strong>“The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic; both front and back are now very usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics.”</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard: </strong>“The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the software. Which Panzarino is not stoked about. It’s aging, he argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my review of the iPad Pro in 2020 — at which point my conclusions were “you can adapt to it but it could be better.” That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years, I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.</p>
<p>I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software: I want to feel the same energy, vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has now come to the crossroad that Microsoft tried to meet with Windows 8 and failed; how do you build an OS that serves either two form factors (touch and mobile, and desktop) well, or two OSs that can share enough third-party software so that neither is neglected? We’ll know more at WWDC.</p>
