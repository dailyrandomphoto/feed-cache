										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global tech talent platform Andela <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">attained a $1.5 billion valuation</a> this September and is currently the only non-fintech unicorn from Africa. Foreign capital propelled Andela to this status, however, Africa-focused venture capital firms such as CRE Ventures and TLcom Capital have been critical to the company&#8217;s early success.</p>
<p>Three years after investing in Andela, the latter raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million fund to invest</a> in other African startups and has done so impressively, leading most of the rounds in which it takes part. Yet, Andela remains its poster child and the firm takes pride in having made the investment years back.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the talent company&#8217;s unicorn news opening more conversations about the maturity of the African tech ecosystem, founder and managing partner <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-caio-1580a97">Maurizio Caio</a>, one of the continent&#8217;s well-respected VC partners, believes that while African tech is minting new unicorns every other month, it is ready to consistently produce high-value exits and IPOs over the next 18 months.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231672" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot chest-beating and happiness in the African ecosystem, not necessarily about the wrong things, but a subset of the right things. We&#8217;re celebrating the amount of money that is invested and the fact that some financing rounds are associated with very high valuations, including unicorn valuations,&#8221; Caio said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think that for the long-term health of the ecosystem, we need a little bit to transition the conversation towards making money and on the return; on the fact that what counts is when these companies will eventually be sold or go public. That&#8217;s the valuation that counts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">W</span>hilst recent high-profile investments have been partly driven by the massive liquidity sitting in global capital markets looking for deployment, Caio says the primary driver is the strong business fundamentals achieved by African entrepreneurs transforming large and underserved markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He cites a list of markers in a playbook dubbed the &#8220;Exit Readiness Framework&#8221; to back up his thesis. In this interview with TechCrunch, Caio talks about this framework, how African tech is at the </span>start of a completely new era fuelled by structural drivers, building sustainable tech companies, venture capital, unicorns and exits. <i><br />
</i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the Exit Readiness Framework?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MC:</strong> The general idea which is also the readiness framework says, for us to have a stronger African venture capital industry that sees the long-term goal, we need to attract more capital to Africa. And to do that, we need to make sure that we create value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other fundamental thing that we believe is that return comes from only one source: business fundamentals, which means you have to have great companies operating in great markets. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should ask ourselves if we are building companies that will be able to attract buyers or attention of capital markets in the form of IPO, or SPAC or whatever because these are companies that have the substantial promise of generating a lot of cash as they win and execute in large and attractive markets.</span></p>
<p><strong>You talk about unicorns being companies executing in large and attractive markets. How does one know these sorts of markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, first of all, there is this idea that an attractive market is a large market. But other things make a market an attractive one for venture investment. One is that technology can make a difference, and the other is an industry that structurally has high margins and not a lot of CapEx. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a feature like the fact that there is consolidation happening by larger companies. From an exit perspective, you know that larger companies are looking for smaller companies to buy. Also, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen there&#8217;s evidence that other emerging markets have gone through the cycle that Africa is going through now and have attracted a lot of capital. </span></p>
<p><strong>Are there particular industries that come to mind when referring to attractive markets in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is sectors with large consumer markets that are not adequately served today because it doesn&#8217;t make sense economically. So you think about education, some of the fintech segments, health &#8212; these are markets where you don&#8217;t have a lot of companies playing there because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to make money because a lot of demand in Africa is low income. But technology can help you build much lower structures and make it profitable to serve those markets. So that is the first big category &#8212; the big consumer markets where technology can make it profitable to serve. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TLcom Capital closes $71M Africa fund with plans to back 12 startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/embed/#?secret=73ja9BAVRd" data-secret="73ja9BAVRd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s another one, which in our opinion, is even bigger. We call it fixing the broken verticals and these are more B2B with sectors that are entirely fragmented and inefficient. You think of retail, logistics, talent, automotive. They are gigantic markets where you don&#8217;t have to do anything to create demand, there&#8217;s a massive amount of demand, but the experience is horrible for businesses and consumers. So you need to have entrepreneurs with technology who can reinvent and redesign these industries. </span></p>
<p><strong>But I think we&#8217;re seeing more companies trying to solve what people would say are sexy problems than tackling these large underserved markets. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there is nothing that is predefined. Spaces that have not created great companies can become an attractive investment when an entrepreneur interprets and makes them bigger. So, again, I don&#8217;t think that there are sectors that, by definition, which are not attractive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see trivial problems getting funded, I don&#8217;t think we should blame the entrepreneur. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is not that we need better entrepreneurs to have a larger ecosystem in Africa; we need better investors. So it&#8217;s on us, not the entrepreneurs. We see fundamentally about 200 to 300 entrepreneurs per quarter, we look at business plans, and we talk to a subset of them, and we invest in an even smaller subset.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders have the right to launch a startup in a sexy place rather than a difficult market &#8212; sometimes some sexy problems have large markets &#8212; but it&#8217;s the responsibility of the investors to channel capital towards the areas that have the best outcome and expectations.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an investor, do you think Africa has reached an inflection point?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. It was not realistic to think that this inflection point would have happened earlier. You know, it takes an average of 10 years or more to build a great company to a good or great exit. We all can have different views about when African venture capital started, yet it&#8217;s completely expected that the pipeline is now producing companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanding higher valuation and unicorn exits. There&#8217;s a pipeline of other companies to come, so we are at the beginning of a very natural cycle that will produce more.</span></p>
<p><strong>For all the talk of a growing ecosystem, why have we seen one major IPO and a few significant exits?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework that we adopt to assess readiness states that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if a company serving a great market has material revenues and a clear path to profitability, it is ready to be acquired. To qualify for an IPO, though, the bar is much higher; you need high growth, one-year visibility, management governance. If you want to go on an international stock exchange, like Nasdaq, you need to have at least $90 million of revenues and at least $500 million valuation. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pAleWLpTcp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=pAleWLpTcp" data-secret="pAleWLpTcp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to look at companies and see whether they are on the way to qualify for this. And that&#8217;s why when we look into the pipeline, we not only see that this framework confirms why Paystack, DPO, Sendwave were acquired or why Jumia and Fawry went public. But you can see going forward, companies that are completely ready for IPO now: Andela, SWVL, Interswitch, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave. And some companies may very soon be ready: Twiga, MFS Africa, Yoco, Kobo360, TeamApt. These are all companies that are getting there and I will not be surprised to see up to 10 IPOs over the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p><strong>Interesting. But don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s a lot, considering how more mature developing markets like India and Latin America have struggled despite many unicorns?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, we&#8217;re back to the framework, and it&#8217;s not magic. It&#8217;s about how the company is performing. So you ask yourself, is this company operating in a large and attractive market? Yes. Do they have at least $90 million in revenues? Yes. Can they command a valuation of at least $500 million? Yes. They have a great management team and a serious board and visibility in one year. Are they growing fast and can that growth be sustained? Yes. At that point, you are ready. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it&#8217;s more of a matter of needing the capital strategically because let us not forget that IPO for some of the investors is an exit event, but for the startup and CEO, it is a financing event. So the decision to go public is driven by market conditions and you don&#8217;t want to go when the market is skeptical. You want to go when you can articulate the story to the capital market that makes it attractive for that market to give you capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that many factors drive the exact timing, but when we talk about the readiness from the standpoint of what the company needs to look like, it&#8217;s possible to assess several companies that can reach those milestones.</span></p>
<p><strong>Still talking about exits, we&#8217;ve only seen a couple of acquisitions made by these unicorns, or soonicorns. Do you think this should change?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. On average, when public companies announce an acquisition, the stock price goes down because acquisitions are challenging to execute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s perfect if the acquisitions are targeted at making a stronger company achieve a lower cost position and deliver more value to customers. But there are always ways of doing it organically, by developing new products and technology and entering new markets. Acquisitions work as a way of executing your strategy more quickly.</span></p>
<p><strong>How about acquisitions from international companies just like Stripe and Paystack? Is it a play we might often see in the future?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will undoubtedly be more acquisitions on behalf of non-African companies buying African companies, which will become driven by sector and strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the big tech companies buy African tech companies to develop their presence in Africa? Yes. They will have their organic and inorganic strategy as Africa becomes a more profound place for these companies to be in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also particular players such as international banks, financial services companies, insurance companies or agritech interested in looking at companies they can acquire to serve the African markets. So yes, there will be more of that. </span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take about foreign money and founders dominating Africa&#8217;s startups and investments?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the 10 unicorns or soon to be unicorns, most of them are led by African founders: Yoco, Flutterwave, MFS Africa, Interswitch, SWVL, Kobo360. At the beginning of most tech ecosystems in Africa, it wasn&#8217;t so, but now I think the medium-term picture is that we have African entrepreneurs. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that once again, funds need to be intentional. And they can be an important factor in allocating capital to African investors. When we at TLcom Capital started to think about Africa, Ido and myself, we realised that we were not Africans and got Omobola and Andreata to be part of our team. And as we have hired more people, we&#8217;ve added more Africans. So the way to have more capital in Africa is to have more African venture capitalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that, quite frankly, if there are great African companies that create employment in Africa that serves an African market that puts Africa on the map, if one of the founders is non-African, that&#8217;s fine in the big scheme of things. Let&#8217;s make sure that we convince capital markets that Africa is a great place to do business. Also, let us attract venture capitalists that don&#8217;t just write a check, get back on the plane and fly away. or hedge funds or private equity people, but African or Africa-focused venture capitalists on the ground that work with the entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><strong>Will it help if big funds like Sequoia, Tiger or SoftBank set up teams in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a critical step and will be very important, but we&#8217;re not there now. These teams are starting to have people devoted to Africa, but yes, they will be better investors when they move people to Africa, which is needed because when </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you think about the big teams writing large checks and sitting in Africa to support companies, it is a very short list. And it should be longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that there are two axes for that to happen. One is that these Africa-focused teams become bigger or international investors move teams to Africa. For us, the African-based VC teams&#8217; primary role is to discover the companies and help them seed and Series A and get them ready for larger checks. That way, we can involve international funds that are learning about the attractiveness of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-weight: 400;">As venture capital records new highs in Africa and across the world, do you see that slowing down on the continent in the next couple of years?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be an amount of investment adjustment. What might happen is a lot of companies dying or fundamentally becoming irrelevant, and that&#8217;s what happens in every venture capital ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that we will see happening is an adjustment in valuations because the high valuations that we&#8217;re seeing now are a small subset of cases driven by the companies&#8217; business fundamentals and a lot of money looking for a place to go. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we might see more reasonable and adjusted valuations from companies when they return to raise capital from less irrational investors, particularly in sectors with a bit of a bubble like fintech.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspiration wants to help commercial fleets go electric, and it has already started by financing electric mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">Revel&#8217;s ride-hail fleet of blue Teslas</a>. The startup, which finances electric vehicles and has plans to build, own and operating the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth on Wednesday with an initial $200 million in capital commitment.</p>
<p>The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure. Josh Green, founder and CEO of Inspiration, described the funding as a platform company investment, one that allows Inspiration to use that money to invest in infrastructure assets, like vehicles and charging solutions, as well as for general corporate purposes. In other words, it&#8217;s balance sheet capital, and Inspiration is only getting started.</p>
<p>The company, which has been operating on the down low since the end of Q1 this year, is in discussions with several other investors to raise more money needed to continue financing vehicles and other infrastructure-related assets, like energy systems like solar that power charging infrastructures, energy storage systems and real estate, according to Green.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a finance company, so we will always be raising money from the right sources to lower the cost of capital and be able to offer EVs to wider segments of the population,&#8221; Green told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our near term goals are to expand into all light and medium-duty segments and use cases and build the leading EV solutions company in North America. As we do that, we want to be thought of as the go-to partner for fleet companies that want a custom, turnkey EV solution from an aligned partner wholly focused on the same end goal: Delivering maximum economic value from EV fleets while achieving meaningful GHG reductions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Inspiration aims to cater for three types of customers. The first is what the startup refers to as emerging EV fleet operators, venture-backed companies that were born based on an EV fleet. Brooklyn-based Revel, the company that started with dockless e-mopeds and has since expanded to a questionable ride-hail fleet of Teslas and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/">an EV charging superhub</a>, falls under this category. Earlier this year, Inspiration helped Revel get 49 EVs for its limited service before New York&#8217;s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) got wind of it and made it clear that a for-hire vehicle, even an electric one, would need a TLC license plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We act as their heavy asset capital partner so that they can use their venture dollars to scale their technology platform customer acquisition and partner with us for the vehicles, charging infrastructure, energy infrastructure, real estate – all the other hard asset components that are quite expensive but necessary for successfully deploying and scaling an EV fleet,&#8221; said Green.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">The second customer segment is traditional fleet operators, like a NYC yellow cab company, that needs help transitioning their otherwise ICE-based fleet to electric.</div>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">&#8220;Basically our goal with those guys is to make deploying an EV fleet as easy and simple as buying another Toyota Camry and throwing the key to the driver,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;For those customers we help them understand which vehicles are the right ones to meet their needs, depending on their daily driving cycle and range and how long the vehicles are stationary. Then we design and implement the charging infrastructure as a system serving those vehicles to ensure business continuity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Corporate fleets are the final category of customer, and these are typical Fortune 500 companies that give company cars to sales and operations employees. Usually, these types of companies are looking for easy ways to reach corporate emissions goals.</p>
<p>Inspiration aims to provide a bespoke service to customers in all categories. It can provide a full-stack solution, says Green, from financing the vehicles to supplying and running charging infrastructure to working with energy companies to ensure electricity is being used efficiently. Or customers can pick and choose a la carte what services they need.</p>
<p>Green thinks charging infrastructure is an integral part of the business, particularly because installing it at a fleet level can be quite expensive and robust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because fleet charging requires much more power in one location, understanding energy pricing and utility rate structures and how they charge, the right time to both serve the fleet&#8217;s needs but also not get killed on your demand charges, is really important,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;In addition, the calculation on the charging side varies dramatically by location. In New York City, for example, the incentives and rate structures are very different than if you were doing it in New Orleans. So the economic benefit of the EV fleet has to take into account a lot of factors, which change by location, and we do that analysis for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">Green, who had been working in climate and clean energy since 2003, founded the startup after a 14 month honeymoon around the world, a trip that began with ClimateTech burnout and ended with a renewed motivation to contribute to the fight against climate change. After retracing steps he had taken in Patagonia some 20 years ago only to see firsthand how climate change had morphed the once-familiar landscapes, Green came back recommitted to the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking about where I could really put my shoulder against the wheel again, and EVs kept coming up as this area that has huge potential,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;Transportation is the largest source of U.S. emissions. EVs are now an area where the technology is ready, there are no technology barriers. The state of battery technology means that all these vehicles now have a base range that&#8217;s able to satisfy pretty much every application on the commercial side. So it&#8217;s become really a finance and deployment issue to solve, and those are things that I have a decent idea of how to attack.&#8221;</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR aims to be an immersive social experience through a combination of full-body motion capture and VR technologies. It allows players to step into another world and go anywhere with their friends. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The San Francisco and Hong Kong-headquartered company announced it has raised $37 million in a Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz through its </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://a16z.com/growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Growth Fund</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which serves new companies at an inflection point, along with Alibaba and Craft. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding, which brings its total raised to approximately $122 million, comes on the heels of three new locations launched in July in Austin, Las Vegas and Shanghai. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR will use the proceeds to open 10 new retail locations across the globe, including Paramus, London and Toronto in 2022, as well as two corporate and two franchise locations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will scale its internal studio to increase content cadence and develop a software development kit (SDK) to open up the Sandbox platform for third-party development, CEO and co-founder Steve Zhao told TechCrunch. He also said that the company plans to build a wireless technology to remove the VR hardware backpack that weighs down the players.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR uses hardware like head-mounted VR headsets, backpack computers, motion capture sensors and haptic vests for players. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“With more stores on the way, we’ll be ramping up our internal studios as well as developing our SDK (software development kit) to open up publishing soon,” Zhao said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR develops its own games and technology, unlike other competitors that operate with licensed games, Zhao noted. </span>The company offers five VR games: Curse of Davy Jones, Amber Sky 2088, Star Trek Discovery: Away Mission, Deadwood Mansion and Unbound Fighting League (UFL).</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic broke out right before closing the company&#8217;s planned Series B funding in early 2020, Zhao said. About 80% of its employees had to leave the company, which was forced to file bankruptcy during the COVID crisis, he added. Sandbox VR has emerged from COVID stronger than ever. Its revenue is now up 20x compared to the beginning of this year (after reopening the global offices in April of this year). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The grit and determination exemplified by Steve and his team at the height of the pandemic was more than admirable &#8212; it’s led</span> them to become what we believe to be the strongest, most technologically advanced location-based VR offering available today,” said Andrew Chen, a16z general partner and Sandbox VR board member.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has 35 employees globally as of October, Zhao said. Sandbox VR currently operates 12 retail locations in the U.S., Canada and Asia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The global location-based virtual reality market is projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 32.9% from 2021 to 2028, <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/location-based-virtual-reality-market/#:~:text=Location%2DBased%20Virtual%20Reality%20Market%20size%20was%20valued%20at%20USD,market%20for%20the%20forecast%20period." target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on a report by Verified Market Research</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR started with an idea of how it can create the most immersive experience possible, like things people see in science fiction. The VR is just a component, he said, adding that the company doesn&#8217;t want to limit its business in the VR sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a mission to expand human interaction by using technology, Sandbox VR has an ambition to enter the metaverse industry down the road, which could take about 3-5 years more to get there, according to Zhao. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As we continue to innovate in the VR industry, we’ll move towards the virtualization of our physical spaces. One day, it’ll be like stepping into a portal where players can embody their persistent virtual avatars,” Zhao said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disha.ng/">Disha</a>, a Nigeria-based platform that allows digital creators to curate, sell digital content, create portfolios and receive payments from their audience globally, announced that it was closing shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the news, Disha had bootstrapped to more than 20,000 users; at some point, it claimed to have a monthly growth rate of about 100%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days after announcing its shutdown, however, Disha did an about-face and said it was thinking of new options for the company and would share an update once it made a new decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sharononyinye_/status/1455475527251369989?s=21">noticed</a> Disha FAQs on Flutterwave’s support documents, suggesting that the unicorn company might have acquired the creator platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha’s FAQs have been <a href="https://support.flutterwave.com/en/collections/3195568-disha-faq">removed</a>, Flutterwave confirmed to TechCrunch today that it has indeed bought the two-year-old platform. The terms of the deal are undisclosed; however, some sources say the purchase price is in six figures.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Flutterwave has been rumoured to acquire some startups in the past, this is its first public announcement of any acquisition since launching in 2016 to tackle Africa’s payments problems. And what’s more surprising is that the buy is outside payments or fintech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one of the well-known platforms built from Africa, including <a href="https://selar.co/">Selar</a> and <a href="https://irawotalents.com/">Irawo</a>, targeting creators and influencers globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Disha provided them with tools to create a one-page site to curate and share links, content, portfolios and a checkout system to receive payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha had users globally, its revenues were low, making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With little revenues and limited resources, Disha showed signs of struggle; even ex-CEO attested to this in a now-deleted LinkedIn post where he expressed burnout while running Disha and Cregital, a design agency he founded and was CEO, a role he stepped down from in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [the founders] decided to shut down the company because we ran out of resources to continue driving the very valid vision we had,” ex-CTO Oyemade told TechCrunch in an email. “With Flutterwave, we now have a way to drive both value for creators and revenue to sustain the business. We are happy to have gotten the call from Flutterwave, which actually kept hopes alive.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oyemade will continue to lead the technology behind the product with a new role as software and architectural lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akanno and Abeng, the ex-CMO, left the company to pursue other projects.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;African payments company Flutterwave raises $170M, now valued at over $1B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/embed/#?secret=u9g3CpoCni" data-secret="u9g3CpoCni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave says Disha will continue to be an independent product with a distinct brand and operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From now on, it wants to focus on features and integrations that help creators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> schedule meetings and exhibitions, build sustainable income through subscriptions and leverage emerging technologies in the creator space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Flutterwave make this acquisition? Certainly, it will bolster Disha’s payments checkout process and grow the platform’s base by allowing users to make transactions in over 150 currencies and 34 countries worldwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave wants to take part in the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-famga-creator-economy/">$100 billion global creator economy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has created an opportunity for millions of freelancers and creators to use no-code tools to monetize their craft and community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recently, we have diversified into building tools that will help freelancers, businesses and now creators grow,” Flutterwave CEO Olugbengba “GB” Agboola said in an email. “We saw Disha as an opportunity to capture a new market of indie creators that need innovative tools to showcase their craft and get paid. This acquisition cements our place as a growth partner for freelancers and businesses. For us, Flutterwave Store is to small businesses what Disha is to creators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an increasing appetite to create, own, sell or share digital experiences such as NFTs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With most of Disha’s customers based in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, it is well-positioned to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions around owning and selling these digital experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave knows that, and via this acquisition, the fintech is betting that Disha is its ticket to eat at that growing NFT table, where more than $10 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">spent</a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Disha is a global tool and the global creator economy is enormous, and with NFTs growing in popularity, there’s no limit to how huge the creator economy can grow,” GB said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for complementary and alternative medicine &#8212; a wide-ranging area that includes practice-based work like yoga as well as a huge range of supplements and everything in between &#8212; has been on a massive upswing , with the global industry valued at <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$82.3 billion in 2020</a> and growing at a fast clip in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Now, a company called <a href="https://fullscript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fullscript</a>, which has built a wholesale backend and storefront builder to power the supplements businesses of alternative health practitioners providing these services, is getting a big infusion of cash to meet the opportunity. The Ottawa, Canada-based company has raised $240 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business across North America, and developing more tools to serve its customers: practitioners building complementary and integrative treatment plans (bringing together both traditional and modern approaches) for their patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe integrated medicine will be medicine in the future,&#8221; Fullscript co-founder and CEO Kyle Braatz said in an interview. &#8220;Sixty percent practitioners are already focusing on wellness and prevention. It&#8217;s more than just pharmaceuticals, and patients are doing more than just popping a pill.&#8221; The company today offers a stock of some 20,000 products from some 300 brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment is coming from HGGC and Snapdragon Capital Partners &#8212; respectively a mid-market firm more known for private equity investments and a firm that invests in primarily health and wellness businesses. Fullscript&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, but for some context, the company has been around since 2012 and had only raised about $25 million previously, growing largely by being bootstrapped. And one reason that it will have come to investors&#8217; attention now is its financial track record on its own steam: it&#8217;s going to make $300 million in revenue this coming fiscal year, growing from a mere $40 million five years ago.</p>
<p>Fullscript is based in the same city as Shopify, and Braatz likened a little of what his company does in its own B2B2C model to what Shopify has achieved in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>Just as the latter has provided an easy way for companies selling online to build and operate their own web-based storefronts (a business that has been huge, and seen Shopify extending into a lot of adjacent areas as a result), Fullscript is addressing the needs of practitioners online.</p>
<p>Among Fullscript&#8217;s services, it helps them source supplements; set up and fulfill prescriptions for those treatments from Fullscript&#8217;s dispensary, either to pick up in their offices or have delivered to their homes; manage their patients&#8217; bigger treatment plans through an integrated approach that brings data from these treatments into a patient&#8217;s wider electronic health records; and provide supplementary reading and other educational materials about the supplements that are being dispensed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as Shopify empowers merchants, we empower practitioners,&#8221; Braatz said. And just as Shopify has brought a number of different tools online for its merchant customers to build out their businesses on the Shopify platform, so too is Fullscript developing more technology to grow its proposition. That will include more analytics for its customers, more tools for patients to monitor their own progress and purchases, and so on.</p>
<p>Fullscript&#8217;s rise comes amid a much bigger push for online health services, and specifically those geared at selling medicines and supplements. That means more potential competition from Amazons of this world (Amazon being already a <a href="https://gritdaily.com/why-amazon-is-king-of-the-supplements-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major destination for vitamins and other supplements</a>), and more attention being paid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others like Ro</a> trying to make headway in this space. But also a greater acceptance and understanding that the online component of this business is here to stay.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Complementary therapies have been a mixed bag when it comes to general acceptance and usage of them.</p>
<p>On one side, consumers, and a widening pool of traditional and modern practitioners are increasingly looking at these alongside the pharmaceutical approach. But on the other, there are a few reason why that hasn&#8217;t been more mainstream. For starters, insurance companies do not always provide coverage for these treatments as they do for the more standard medical treatments. One of the reasons for this is that, for better or worse, pharmaceutical approaches are trialled, tested, approved by regulators and generally entered into a realm of acceptance that makes it more likely that an insurance company (or practitioner) will opt for those treatments. The same has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not been the case for supplementary medicines</a>, not least because some of the effects might be harder to quantify. And partly because of that, or even from direct experience, there are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51312441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of reputable skeptics</a> when it comes to those effects.</p>
<p>Insurance is not part of the backend for the moment for Fullscript, and all of the payments for products are made by patients directly themselves.</p>
<p>In the defense of integrative approaches, however, there are plenty of reasons why consumers and the medical industry might also criticize the pharmaceutical approach, too (not least because it&#8217;s not 100% foolproof, the costs, the side effects and so on). Indeed, Braatz noted that attitudes towards integrative approaches are gradually starting to change, not least because of the many reasons that conventional approaches do not work perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole integrative market is just starting to leverage insurance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Practitioners starting to be compensated because compensation is evolving from volume to value-based. And we see hospital systems starting to build and acquire integrative clinics to keep patients out of hospital systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evolution, in effect, is as much a part of the investment strategy here as the current business is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are long term believers in the Fullscript story, and we thought that its platform, the tech they developed, and the reviews of that we&#8217;ve seen of it from the industry, would be an exciting investment. There is a ton of potential,&#8221; said Bill Conrad of HGGC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor interest in African fintech continues to grab headlines with large fundraises. Today, Africa’s largest digital payments network <a href="https://mfsafrica.com/">MFS Africa</a> joins the fray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in Series C financing — split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private equity fund <a href="https://www.africinvest.com/news-and-media/news/africinvest-s-permanent-vehicle-five-achieves-its-fourth-close-bringing-afdb-as-investor/">AfricInvest FIVE</a> co-led the Series C round with existing investors Goodwell Investments and LUN Partners Group.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors CommerzVentures, Allan Gray Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest also joined the round</span>, while ShoreCap III returned as an existing investor with other funds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement is the icing on the cake for the company, which has made several significant acquisitions and investments in the last couple of years rarely matched by any fintech on the continent.</span></p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dare-okoudjou">Dare Okoudjou</a> was quick to highlight MFS Africa’s mission on the continent: to make it easy for Africans to send and receive money just as they do with calls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone who spent more than a decade in the telecoms as an engineer and executive, Okoudjou has been around long enough to know how difficult it was to make a phone call in Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though calls are still expensive in Africa when compared to the rest of the world, the process of making them has become pretty simple thanks to mobile phone penetration and advancement in telecommunications. With MFS Africa, Okoudjou envisions the same for payments on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we take for granted the fact that we can communicate with anybody around the world via a mobile phone, my dream is that it should be the same with a mobile wallet,” CEO Okoudjou told TechCrunch during an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you sign to any mobile wallet somewhere in the world, starting with Africa, it should be enough to transact with anybody else in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the grand mission of the company.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started the company in 2009, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions from Kenya to Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast, and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s the company continued to grow, it became </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the product had use cases for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, at the time, more than half of its users in East Africa reported using the platform for business reasons, according to Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by merging fragmented and disparate payment schemes across the continent into one seamless network the same telecom networks operate, MFS Africa became the go-to platform for individuals and businesses to transact across borders and currencies.</span></p>
<h2>MFS has made a series of acquisitions and investments this past year</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company connects more than 320 million mobile money wallets across 35+ African countries and 700 corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also covers a broad range of financial services around bank accounts, prepaid cards and virtual debit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a presence in Africa’s largest market, Nigeria, remained elusive for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat changed last month when <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it acquired Baxi</a>, an agent banking platform developed by Capricorn Digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria is quite different from the typical MFS market, where mobile money agents run the show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the West African country, agent banking networks are more prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because they offer a similar range of services in digitizing cash like mobile money agents in East Africa, it made sense for MFS to acquire Capricorn and have access to its more than 90,000 agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does the acquisition give MFS Africa an entry into the Nigerian market, but it also opens the company to a sophisticated agent network unseen in other African markets, said Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money agents are primarily helpful in providing customers with cash deposits and withdrawals whereas agent network platforms like Capricorn, via its Baxi boxes, provide underbanked and unbanked Nigerians with access to transfers, withdrawals, airtime purchases, utility bill payments, pay-TV and data subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Agent networks are the most digitalized segment of SMEs already on the continent because very often they have other businesses selling other things. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are plugged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the economy and the fabric of society,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if you’re thinking about bringing digital payment and digital at large to SMEs in Africa, this is a pretty good place to start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again that what’s happening in Nigeria may end up being the blueprint for the rest of the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Baxi acquisition is completed, pending approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Okoudjou says a customer can walk to a Baxi agent and make cross-border payments to Benin, Cameroon or China, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating payments from Africa to China falls outside the purview of MFS Africa’s holistic pan-African payments approach. However, it’s an opportunity too good to ignore: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China-Africa bilateral trade is one of the fastest-growing corridors globally, with a value <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">topping $192 billion</a> in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoudjou says the company began considering the corridor when it kickstarted the acquisition of Beyonic, a Ugandan digital payments provider for small and medium-sized businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Johannesburg-based company had surveyed these businesses to understand their needs better and found out the most pressing issue they faced, asides from accessing loans, was sending and receiving payments to and from China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa is currently working on setting interoperability between payment networks in the Asian country and Africa, starting from Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before spreading to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The timeline for rollout might be next year, according to some sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, MFS Africa </span><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"> acquired Beyonic</a>; with Baxi, the company has made two consecutive acquisitions in the space of a year and some months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And coupled with minority stakes in smaller fintechs such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/ivorian-fintech-julaya-raises-2m-to-digitize-business-payments-in-francophone-africa/">Julaya</a>, Maviance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Numida</a>; health insurance product Inclusivity and agritech platform Akorion, MFS Africa has done a decent job using investment and acquisitions — methods Okoudjou terms “inorganic growth” — to exert its influence across the continent.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MFS Africa leads $2.3M seed round in Ugandan fintech startup Numida&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/embed/#?secret=2nKojlgC7M" data-secret="2nKojlgC7M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, MFS Africa raised its Series B and closed at $23 million after some extensions. With this Series C round, its total equity raise is over $95 million while debt stands at $30 million (the company is raising debt for the first time). Emerging markets lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/">Lendable</a> and Norsad provided the debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt presents an opportunity for many founders and startups to have cheaper funding because they do not have to give out equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MFS Africa’s case, it raised debt financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If someone is sending money from Kenya to Uganda in less than a minute, someone needs to be out of pocket. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We manage that across all these countries across all these partners, and you need a little bit of oil to grease the system,” said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we don’t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s one of the reasons we looked at debt and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again, as the ecosystem matures, more companies will also do a combination of debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa intends to use the new investment in several ways. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it wants to double down on its expansion efforts and add more regional offices across the continent and in the U.S. and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently opened new offices in Abidjan, Kampala, Kinshasa, Nairobi and Lagos while moving its headquarters from Mauritius to London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-year-old company has also earmarked some funding to strengthen its Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) functions and treasury and liquidity pool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to hire more talent within and outside the continent and continue investing in other African tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/juliustichelaar">Julius Tichelaar</a>, a partner at AfricInvest FIVE, said his firm led the round because MFS Africa’s broad range of financial and payments services resonates with AfricInvest FIVE’s financial inclusion strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cross border payments remain an important challenge in many African markets today and MFS Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned to confront this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join MFS Africa’s world-class management team on its mission and to support its growth journey,” he concluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.amenitiz.io">Amenitiz</a>, a Barcelona-based startup that describes its products as the operating system for independent hoteliers, B&amp;Bs and cottages. In more technical terms, Amenitiz has been building a vertical software-as-a-service product that combines everything you need to run a hotel.</p>
<p>The company just raised a $7.5 million (€6.5 million) seed round led by Point Nine. Backed, Otium and several business angels, such as Avi Meier, Matt Robinson and Carlos Gonzales, also participated in today’s round. Jean-Christophe Taunay and Arthur Waller are also going to be independent board members.</p>
<p>In particular, Amenitiz takes care of three important bricks in the hotel industry —&nbsp;it’s a property management system, it acts a channel manager and it let you accept direct bookings more easily.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You may have noticed that the same hotel is listed on many different websites that mostly belong to two companies —&nbsp;Booking Holdings (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak…) and Expedia Group (Expedia, Hotels.com, HomeAway, Trivago…). As distribution channels are highly fragmented, it has become complicated to manage listings on all those websites.</p>
<p>Hotels usually rely on channel managers to avoid cumbersome micro-management work. A channel manager can manage your listings across dozens of booking sites at once. Bookings are synchronized, which means that your hotel will appear as full on Hotels.com when you have sold the last room on Booking.com.</p>
<p>And a channel manager becomes even more useful when it integrates directly with your property management system (PMS). That tool lets you manage your hotel. For instance, you can allocate rooms, add an extra night and get an overview of the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on legacy technology, Amenitiz wants to create a proper software-as-a-service alternative that works well out of the box. As an added benefit, you can build cool stuff on top of this foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, the startup also helps you create a website your for your hotel or B&amp;B. On this site, you can let users book rooms directly using the startup’s booking module. And even if people want to book a room with a phone call or a WhatsApp message, you can send a payment link and track the booking in Amenitiz.</p>
<p>So far, Amenitiz has attracted 3,000 properties. With today’s funding round, Amenitiz plans to add more features, such as revenue management. It’ll triple the size of its teal with a focus on the French, Italian and Spanish markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan edtech startup</span><a href="https://craydel.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform for comparing colleges, course options and tuition fees, has secured $1 million in a pre-seed round that will go toward improving its search and recommendation technology and enhancing its online resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Enza Capital, a private venture fund that invests in early-stage tech startups across Africa. Other investors in the round include Future of Learning Fund, a Kenya-based edtech backer; BriteGaze, a South African artificial intelligence fund; Bisk Ventures; a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm and Tekton Ventures; a San Francisco-based technology investment firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya-based Chandaria Capital, Nigeria-based LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund, and an array of other angel investors including founders and top executives of Africa’s leading SaaS, e-commerce and education startups joined, as well.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231607" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel was launched earlier this year by co-founders </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-sardana-a570497/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manish Sardana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-nguru-38677638/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Nguru</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayne-aman-premji/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Aman Premji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was inspired by the lack of a reliable portal in Africa to guide decisions on college and course selection. This provided a window of opportunity for the trio to bring to life a platform that would eliminate this challenge. Through Craydel, the founders said, they are giving power back to students by providing them with access to a portal that offers verified information about colleges to help them in decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An estimated $30 billion is spent every year on higher education in Africa,&#8221; Sardana, Craydel&#8217;s CEO, said. &#8220;But the current student experience in accessing higher education is abysmal. There is no aggregation of choices, and decision-making is influenced by biases and misinformation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are transforming the way students discover, compare and apply to higher education in Africa,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel provides students with options at every level, including online certificate programs, for which they can enroll to test the waters before settling on a final decision about the careers they want to pursue. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe in the power of the youth in Africa to create lasting transformative change. And Craydel is driven to empower them to access the best education pathways to unleash their true potential,” said Sardana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premji, Craydel’s chief financial officer, told TechCrunch that the edtech startup also takes the students through a career assessment to ensure they are a good fit for the chosen program and college. It also guides them on course application and visa processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has so far partnered with more than 90 universities and vocational colleges in Africa and abroad, and currently provides a listing of 3,000 higher education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Craydel is set to embark on a new path to build its search and recommendation engine for more spot-on suggestions, as well as build resources that will help students and professionals in the decision-making.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This paradox of choice is sometimes not a good thing,&#8221; Premji said. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re building using AI at the search and recommendation engine, which is proprietary technology to us. Through it, students or working professionals will tell us their interests, grades, budgets. We will also talk about their career aspirations and conduct aptitude assessments. The outcome of all these assessments is a curated list of the leading potential choices for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edtech space in Africa is still nascent, but it is expected to grow as internet penetration deepens &#8212; connecting more people &#8212; and as more students enroll in higher education across the continent.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://kenza-bouhaj.medium.com/edtech-in-africa-a-landscape-6bb03c299b33"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending on education in Africa is expected to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $740 billion by 2030, at a 14% compound annual growth rate, and edtech spending is projected to expand fast, reaching $57 billion by 2030. Africa’s burgeoning young population provides an opportunity for the growth of companies such as Craydel, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">edtech providing solutions for many challenges, including those of accessibility, quality, affordability and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Kenya has several edtech startups, including</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched last year to offer live lessons for students up to 18 years old; <a href="https://enezaeducation.com/">Eneza Education</a>, which enables learning through mobile technology; and <a href="https://e-limu.org/">e-Limu</a>, a literacy app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Access to higher education and skills development for Africa&#8217;s growing youth population remains fragmented, yet is a fundamental cornerstone to our accelerated development,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Enza Capital managing partner Mike Mompi, who is set to join Craydel’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Craydel is building the rails to democratize access to higher education and to support millions of Africans up this curve.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery firm Zomato is in talks to back logistics firm Shiprocket, savings app Magicpin, and health and fitness firm CureFit, four people familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>All these investment talks are at final stages and some may close as soon as this week, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The investment in Shiprocket is part of a broader round that is being led by Singapore&#8217;s Temasek, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Indian newspaper Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/shiprocket-eyes-200-million-from-temasek-and-others/articleshow/86025605.cms">first reported</a> about Temasek and Shiprocket talks. MoneyControl also reported about some of these talks and <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/exclusive-zomato-wants-to-do-an-info-edge-scouts-for-investments-in-startups-7698731.html">Zomato&#8217;s investment strategy</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, has explored investment opportunities in his personal capacity as well as through the firm in at least over half a dozen startups in recent months, according to sources at many of those firms.</p>
<p>In June, the publicly listed firm Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/">invested $100 million in online grocer Grofers</a>, and according to two people familiar with the matter, has told the younger firm that it is open to fully acquiring it at a later stage if certain metrics are achieved.</p>
<p>Zomato declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid on-demand grocery and convenience delivery craze that has taken over Europe and the U.S. this past year is gradually making its way into Africa and the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>Today, the spotlight is on RabbitMart, or <a href="https://www.rabbitmart.com/">Rabbit</a> for short, a startup coming out of stealth with <span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million in pre-seed funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit is the latest of a long list of startups investors are willing to pump money into globally to deliver groceries and other items from neighbourhood fulfilment centres to people’s homes in 20 minutes or less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Egypt and Africa at large, Rabbit is one of the pioneers alongside Breadfast, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/">announced</a> that it would begin to complete deliveries in less than 20 minutes. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, Foundation Venture, MSA Capital and Goodwater Capital participated in this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-seed round, a new record for its stage in Africa and the Middle East, surpassing Egyptian fintech Telda at $5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmadyousry">Ahmad Yousry</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/walidshabana">Walid Shabana</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-hafez">Ismail Hafez</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarek-elgeresy-256a9987">Tarek El Geresy</a> founded Rabbit in June. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Yousry, in an interview with TechCrunch, said the founders began discussing the idea of replicating fast delivery models in Egypt after noticing that he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a sequence of slow and failed deliveries whenever he ordered groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You make an order, but you’re not quite sure if it’s gonna come or it’s going to be out of stock,” he said. “You’re not quite sure if it’s going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 100% or it’s going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on time or delayed. You’re not quite sure what you are going to get.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a surface level, groceries are items people forget to buy and panic when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need them, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is why most on-demand platforms in Europe, such as Getir and Gorillas, launched first in that vertical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But over time, they found out that on-demand retail &#8212; offering other items that an impulse buyer would need in, say, a supermarket &#8212; was a bigger market and opportunity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the case with Yousry and his co-founders; they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studied use cases where people bought stuff from e-commerce platforms but would wait days to get it and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled on basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever the consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants under 20 minutes, we’re going to let the market dictate what we sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player,” he said, differentiating the company from other grocery delivery platforms such as GoodsMart and Appetito in Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit operates similarly to other international on-demand convenience delivery startups before it. It has taken the Amazon model, large warehousing and broken it down into small pieces &#8212; micro-fulfilment centres &#8212; in four neighbourhoods across Cairo: Mohandeseen, Zamalek, Maadi and Nasr City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit buys these five categories of items (groceries, basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items) from third-party suppliers, stores them in its warehouses, adds a markup and sells through an app with a flat delivery fee for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it controls the end-to-end experience on its platform. It has a live inventory tracking system in its warehouses to monitor what’s on the shelf and equip riders &#8212; some employed, some self-employed &#8212; with the necessary protective gear and technology to make the deliveries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-month-old startup plans to add a new fulfilment centre every other week till the end of the year to cover several major cities in the next 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit has been in stealth since June and only launched last month. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first two days, about 30% of the orders delivered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in less than 20 minutes; last week, the number increased to 90%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we look at it is straightforward. If McDonald’s can deliver sandwiches in 30 minutes, and they still have to make the sandwich, then if we get things right, we can easily deliver in 20 minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many publications covering the frenzy happening within the on-demand convenience delivery space have probed the question of whether these companies can fulfil their delivery times without breaking their riders. It’s a situation Gorillas has faced this year; in a bid to execute deliveries in less than 10 minutes, it has attracted protests from some drivers demanding improved working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yousry says Rabbit’s tech and operations are such that an in-house team takes care of receiving an order and packaging in 120 seconds or less</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, the rest, about 18 minutes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for drivers to complete the order. This way, Yousry hopes the company will not have to be at loggerheads with its drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s exactly the reason why we went with 20 minutes and not 10. We could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do 10 minutes, but if we do, we’re stretching our delivery riders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it wouldn’t account for their health and safety,” said Yousry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, there are two minutes under the roof, and there’s the rest on delivery time; it gives the couriers time to drive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They don’t need to rush, and they abide by traffic regulations and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take things slower.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, only a few people have used the service, and while Yousry does not give hard numbers on traction, he said the company now completes more than 50 orders per location daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects Rabbit to process hundreds of thousands of orders per month soon. But with a little more than 50 riders, how does it plan to achieve that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The CEO said the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is currently recruiting over 100 roles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across driver, in-store and human resources departments to meet the high influx of demand it expects after going live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Lorenzo Franzi, a partner at Global Founders Capital, said, “The Rabbit team is setting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">totally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new standard for the grocery industry in Egypt and the broader region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They offer a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new experience to customers compared to traditional grocers and local stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Talal Alasmari of Raed Ventures said his firm backed the six-month-old startup because the founders have the vision and expertise to lead the “ultra-fast delivery domain” in Egypt, the Middle East and Africa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mathpresso, the Seoul-based edtech company behind QANDA, an AI-based learning app for K-12 students, announced today it has added Google as a new investor.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s undisclosed investment is not part of its Series C raised in June, the company said without providing its valuation.</p>
<p>The additional investment event comes five months after its $50 million Series C, which brought its total funding to $105 million as of June. The company&#8217;s previous backers include SoftBank Venture Asia, MiraeAsset Venture Investment, Smilegate Investment, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation and Legend Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mathpresso expects to create synergies with Google in terms of its global market expansion and technological advancement.</p>
<p>More than 85% of QANDA’s users are outside of Korea, in Japan and Southeast Asia. The Seoul-headquartered startup has offices in Tokyo, Hanoi, Jakarta and Bangkok and offers seven languages: English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian.</p>
<p>Mathpresso was founded in 2015 by co-CEO Ray Lee and Jake Lee, who developed QANDA as a 1:1 Q&amp;A service platform. In 2016, Mathpresso launched QANDA, which provides detailed math solutions and personalized learning content catered to each user’s level. QANDA’s AI-based optical character recognition (OCR) technology, added in 2017, recognizes text and mathematical formulas in a photo and enables users to search for answers in seconds.</p>
<p>Approximately 10 million photos are uploaded every day on QANDA platform, the statement said. The company claims that the QANDA app has amassed over 45 million registered users and 3 billion education data points, with over 12 million monthly active users in 50 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mathpresso added new features on QANDA earlier this year, including the premium subscription model that offers unlimited “byte-sized” micro-video lectures and the community feature that enhances collaborative learning like an online study group.</p>
<p>“The investment by Google opens up exciting opportunities for Mathpresso and enhances our ability to serve students around the world,” said Chief Financial Officer of Mathpresseo Soo Nahm. “Together with the recent Series C funding, this investment will help us accelerate our global market expansion as well as our technological advancement.”</p>
<p>QANDA is available on Android, iOS and Web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle startup listed on the NYSE, will be in at least six European markets by 2022.</p>
<p>The firm shared its ambitions for Europe on its earnings call this week. Nio is already taking orders for its electric SUVs and shipping small batches<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Norway</a>, its first stop outside China. It didn&#8217;t identify which five countries it will enter next year.</p>
<p>The young carmaker challenges behemoths like Tesla and covets a slice of the luxury car market. I wasn&#8217;t convinced that the seven-year-old startup could lure customers away from Mercedez Benz or BMW. But recently, a friend, who used to be religious about German cars, paid about $70,000 for a Nio sports sedan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What hooks him isn&#8217;t the car&#8217;s sleek design or its marketed 600-kilometer range. It&#8217;s the experience <em>around</em> owning a Nio.</p>
<p>When his wife goes shopping, my friend passes time with his daughter in one of Nio&#8217;s owner clubs, which sit in posh malls across China&#8217;s affluent cities. He shows me a Nio app, which has data on his car&#8217;s status and lets him speak to a human assistant in real-time. The app also has a news feature, an e-commerce store and a user forum. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I bought a lot of stuff off its store,&#8221; he says while scrolling through other owners&#8217; posts. What Nio has created is an all-in-one &#8220;super app&#8221; that Chinese users have gotten used to, thanks to Tencent and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Now Nio is exporting that user experience to Europe, home to some of the world&#8217;s most revered automakers.</p>
<p>To be sure, Norway is a small market with a population of five million people. Nio still has a long way to go before proving its potential in larger markets like Germany and the United Kingdom. Its success, then, hinges on whether it could delegate real power to its country managers. It&#8217;s up to founder William Li to decide how much control to give to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-schwarz-66354a46/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Schwarz</a>, Nio&#8217;s first Europe CEO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orders in Norway had &#8220;exceeded expectation&#8221; and &#8220;a quarter&#8221; of the customers who tried its cars ended up placing an order, Nio said on this week&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The company proposes a &#8220;battery-as-a-service&#8221; model that allows people to buy its car without a battery and pay for a BaaS subscription later. But the vision requires the setup of a charging network throughout a new country, which is no small feat in the age of COVID.</p>
<p>At least early customer feedback in Norway appears positive. &#8220;It seems that everyone is quite excited about the battery swapping stations and the battery as a service business model,&#8221; the firm revealed in its <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/13/nio-inc-nio-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q2 earnings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/13/nio-inc-nio-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of June</a>, Nio had over 40 staff in Norway. In Oslo, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCDzQTNGStE&amp;ab_channel=NIO%E8%94%9A%E6%9D%A5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muji-esque customer club</a> recently opened. It already operates a design center in Munich, an engineering force in the U.K. and an autonomous driving team in San Jose.</p>

Photo: Nio</p></div></p>
<p>Xpeng, Nio&#8217;s archrival in China, has yet to expand out of China but has plans to do so, according to a recent <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/26/xpeng-inc-xpev-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">analyst call</a>. Starting 2023, Xpeng will launch &#8220;at least two or three new vehicles every year&#8221; supporting its flagship driver assistance system. It also &#8220;intends to make these future new models, including hardware, software and services simultaneously available in China and in international markets,&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting and challenging time for China&#8217;s new EV makers, which are supercharged with investor money and advanced technology. But as Chinese companies, they are coping with an increasingly hostile global environment. And as they let algorithms play a bigger role in steering vehicles, they will face a barrage of questions about how they protect user safety and data privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has ruled that Apple can&#8217;t push back the deadline to update App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court&#8217;s decision</a> on California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist as Epic Games had alleged, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple&#8217;s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. The court&#8217;s original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple&#8217;s own payment systems, but Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided &#8212; a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">September 10, 2021 ruling</a> issued by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on the Epic Games antitrust case had ordered Apple to no longer stop developers from:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;&#8230;including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court also said Apple couldn&#8217;t prevent developers from communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through their account registration within the app.</p>
<p>Apple in October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">officially updated its App Store rules</a> to address developers&#8217; ability to communicate with their users, as that change was also a part of its settlement with a group of U.S. developers in a class-action lawsuit over the same matter. However, upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal of the Epic Games lawsuit</a>, Apple asked for a stay on the injunction Judge Gonzalez Rogers had put into place which would open up the App Store to non-Apple payment systems.</p>
<p>Per the ruling, the required App Store policy changes had an early December deadline, as the judge ordered the injunction to be implemented within 90 days of the September 10 ruling. That meant, if Apple wasn&#8217;t granted this stay on the injunction, it would have to permit developers to point to alternative means of payment inside their iOS apps.</p>
<p>During a November 9 hearing to hear arguments both for and against the stay, Apple&#8217;s legal counsel argued that the changes Apple was being forced to implement would &#8220;upset the platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is the fact. It is going to happen,&#8221; said Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher partner Mark Perry, a lead lawyer for Apple on the Epic Games case. He reiterated Apple&#8217;s position that allowing links inside apps could introduce security and privacy risks into the iOS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Epic Games&#8217; counsel, Gary Bornstein, pointed out that Apple said during the trial that its first-party payments platform competed with web payments. It can&#8217;t turn around and now say that raising consumer awareness about this competitive alternative would now cause &#8220;irreparable harm.&#8221; He added, too, that Apple shouldn&#8217;t be left to sort out the changes on its own as, so far, many of the steps Apple has taken to open up the App Store were in response to either class action lawsuits or legislative and regulatory developments. Apple disagreed, pointing to other pro-consumer changes it has made, like the App Store privacy labels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judge ruled today that Apple failed to successfully argue its case for a stay and denied the motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property,&#8221; wrote Judge Gonzalez Rogers. &#8220;This incipient antitrust conduct is the result, in part, of the anti-steering policies which Apple has enforced to harm competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Apple said it intends to try again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any immediate comment.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision, if upheld, could have a significant impact on the App Store&#8217;s business model, as developers looking to skirt Apple&#8217;s commissions would be able to point their users to other payment methods when the policy is updated. The fallout from the decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business">could cost</a> the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=gni836kR">billions</a>, depending on how many developers take up the opportunity and how many consumers decide to pay outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Already, some in the market were moving forward to capitalize on that potential change before the policy had been officially revised.</p>
<p>For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> rather prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple’s own payments system as soon as the injunction went into effect. (A full replacement for Apple’s in-app purchase system  wouldn’t be permitted, however, only external links.) Facebook, meanwhile, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">rolled out a system for direct creator payments</a> bypassing the App Store. This system was technically permitted because Facebook isn&#8217;t taking a cut of creator revenues for the time being. But with a decision that permits other payment mechanisms, that system could change in the future opening up a new revenue stream for the social network.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how exactly Apple will rewrite its rules to comply with the court&#8217;s decision if it&#8217;s not able to convince the court to grant its motion. When South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">issued a new law</a> also requiring app stores to allow for other payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">Google complied</a> while adjusting <a href=“ https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments”>fees</a>, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">Apple said</a> its current policies were in compliance due to how the law was written.</p>
<p>The court reminded Apple it had 90 days to comply with the injunction per the original ruling and still has approximately 30 days before it goes into effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric automaker Rivian <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has priced its initial public offering at $78 a share, pushing it far above its targeted share price as investors dove in the year&#8217;s most highly anticipated IPO.</span></p>
<p>Updated: the story haas been updated to reflect the regulatory filing figures.</p>
<p>The company offered 153 million shares of common stock at the $78 per share price, according to regulatory filing was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm">posted late Friday evening</a>. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The gross proceeds from the offering is expected to be about $11.9 billion, before accounting for commissions, discounts and other expenses. That amount also excludes the underwriters option to buy additional shares. If underwriters exercise those options, Rivian stands to raise a total of $13.8 billion.</p>
<p>On a fully dilated basis, that places Rivian&#8217;s valuation at more than $77 billion.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by Amazon, said in a filing earlier this month that it planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. It then upped the range to between $72 and $74 due to investor interest in company.</p>
<p>Rivian filed October 1 to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">publicly traded company</a> in the United States. The S-1 document did not disclose the targeted share price at the time. An amended document filed Monday provided the new information, which included interest from repeat backer Amazon and newcomer Blackstone in Rivian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, D1 Capital Partners LP, Third Point LLC, funds affiliated with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and certain entities affiliated with Soros Fund Management LLC have indicated an interest in buying up to $5 billion of shares of Class A common stock.</p>
<p>A recent filing by Amazon shows the e-commerce giant already holds more than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beating the street and its own guidance, Zynga reported record third-quarter revenue of $705 million, up 40% from the same period last year and reaching its largest mobile audience ever of 183 million monthly active users, up 120% year over year.</p>
<p>Despite warning in the second quarter of a material impact from Apple’s privacy policy changes that caused a dramatic 30% sell off in its stock from August 5 through November 4, Zynga’s share price jumped today on news that it had better than expected user-acquisition performance and is back on track to finish the year strong.</p>

<p>TechCrunch spoke with Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau on how the mobile game giant has been able to navigate the advertising crisis while making moves to expand cross-platform and onto the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Weathering the storm<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>On <a href="https://qz.com/1997873/apples-idfa-privacy-update-threatens-to-upend-the-ad-industry/">April 26</a>, when Apple changed its IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and required developers to use its ATT (App Tracking Transparency) tool to allow users to opt out of being tracked across iOS apps, it shook the mobile ad ecosystem. New users gained during the lockdown dropped off in droves as pandemic restrictions lifted but as targeting became more difficult, acquisition costs soared. Companies began to report a <a href="https://www.consumeracquisition.com/idfa-impact-q2-earnings-reports">15%-20% hit to revenue</a> according to marketing firm Consumer Acquisition. Among those most affected were ad platforms like <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-snapchat-q3-2021-stock-drop-1235094751/">Snapchat</a>, advertisers like <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1456369493890850818?s=20">Peloton</a> and Zynga, which is both an ad platform and advertiser.</p>
<p>“The midpoint of this year was tough,” Gibeau told TechCrunch. “We were one of the first ones out of the chute with the combination of IDFA and the great reopening demand issues. To navigate, we pulled back on our ad spend and began to experiment with new tools and techniques, and by September, we started to see yields come back to normal.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said they waited to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zynga-farmville-3-launches/">FarmVille 3</a> until growth rates returned, and he was excited to see the game shoot to the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the top free iPad and iPhone app store, respectively, after its November 4 launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m happy to report that we feel the worst is behind us and we are scaling up our spending for new games as we head into the fourth quarter. The key to navigating this period has been how we use our first-party data with the Chartboost platform,” he said, referencing the ad network Zynga acquired earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of data about what happens when players come into our games, the events they play and what advertisers are doing in our existing supply. First-party data allows us to build models that make predictions about the types of returns or auctions that would be beneficial to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Zynga is also partnering with Unity, Google and Iron Source, among others, to find ways to better target players.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of smart people attacking this problem. It’s more a function of time than there’s not going to be a solution,” he said. “Over the long term, Apple is building a capable platform to support a healthy advertising market while protecting player privacy, and we’re happy to work with them on this,” he said.</p>
<h2>Rocking hypercasual</h2>
<p>Although 80% of Zynga’s business is subscriptions and microtransactions from in-app purchases, a fifth of the company’s revenue is from advertising, a fast-growing segment being driven by the popularity of hypercasual games, which are games with simple interfaces that can typically be played in fewer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Zynga nearly doubled its advertising revenue over the prior-year period, said Gibeau, attributing its success to Rollic, an Istanbul-based game studio that Zynga <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">acquired a year ago</a> that helped it become a top-three publisher in the category.</p>
<p>“If you look at the number of installs on the app stores, hypercausal is the largest category. These are very inexpensive games that reach massive audiences and utilize advertising as its primary means of monetization. It’s a very lucrative place for us to be and a great feeder of users into our network that ties into our ambitions to create an at-scale publishing and advertising platform that will be a growth driver for us into 2022 and beyond,” said Gibeau.</p>
<h2>All roads lead to the metaverse</h2>
<p>Zynga’s next big game release is <a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-hunters">Star Wars: Hunters</a>, which is soft launching on Android in select markets next week and testing on iOS and Switch in the New Year, Gibeau said. It’s the company’s first cross-platform game on console and FarmVille 3 was its first cross-platform launch on macOS.</p>
<p>Gibeau explained his interest in making Zynga’s mobile games playable on other platforms.</p>
<p>“FarmVille fans and Star Wars fans are everywhere, so it really behooves us to be platform agnostic and make our experience available as many places as possible,” he said. “At the end of the day, we’re a social game company that believes it’s more fun to play games together than by yourself. So as part of our culture, we like to innovate and try new things.”</p>
<p>Since 2020, Zynga has had games on <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/zynga-to-put-words-with-friends-style-game-on-google-nest-devices-in-bid-to-lure-nongamers">Google Nest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/amazon-and-zynga-partner-on-word-pop-a-words-with-friends-spinoff-created-for-alexa/">Amazon Alexa,</a> and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/tiktok-ventures-into-mobile-gaming-initially-in-partnership-with-zynga/">released its first game on TikTok called Disco Loco 3D</a>, which is a free-to-play music and dance challenge.</p>

<p>“In gaming you can get caught out if you miss the next platform. If you get that wrong, it can be pretty painful. So we thought it would be cool to develop experiences on these social platforms to see if there’s any interest. With Snapchat, we partnered with them to help them figure out how to make gaming more a part of their ecosystem, and we’re seeing some good results — but it’s early days,” said Gibeau emphasizing that these games are intended to be proof of concept more than revenue generators.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile">Netflix Gaming</a> having launched on November 2 with former Zynga chief creative officer Mike Verdu at the helm, Gibeau said, “For Netflix, there’s a lot to learn in terms of how they want to approach the subscriptions end of the business and how their users interact with the games, so I don’t know if they’re ready yet for third-party content, but it would be great to talk with them at some point in the future.”</p>
<p>He added, “Whether it’s Netflix or Roblox or Epic or Valve, if they have a platform and it makes sense for our content to be there and reach an audience, we’ll definitely investigate it.”</p>
<p>But perhaps Zynga’s biggest venture ahead lies with the hire of former EA executive Matt Wolf to head up its new blockchain gaming division. As the NFT craze sweeps the gaming industry, blockchain startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Mythical Games</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/20/forte-raises-185m-at-1b-valuation-for-blockchain-game-platform/">Animoca and Forte</a> have reached billion-dollar valuations in the past few months to help developers create permanent collectible items that can be used across games.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of capital and talent heading into the space,” said Gibeau, explaining the timing of the decision. “Our founder and chair, Mark Pincus, and longtime board member, Bing Gordon, are very hot on the sector and we believe that blockchain is going to be part of the fabric of gaming long term.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said Wolf is setting up a skunkworks project to identify the best path forward and will be looking at things like how owning a farm in the FarmVille franchise could drive greater engagement and retention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://mevo.com/pages/mevo-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App</a> three-camera kit costs $999. Add some good lights and a half-decent microphone, and you have a full multi-cam streaming setup for less than $2,000. That would have been completely unthinkable just a few years ago, and let&#8217;s just take a minute to consider how absolutely astonishing how far we have come. Add a rock-solid internet connection, and you have essentially replicated the core functionality of a satellite van full of equipment costing two orders of magnitude more than this kit.</p>
<p>Could a professional broadcast news crew use a Mevo Start kit? No &#8212; you would need higher reliability, better redundancy and equipment facing the needs of a live news reporter. But if you come at the same problem from another angle, things start to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>What if you are a YouTube streamer who wants to up your game? Perhaps you have been using a collection of web cameras and <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS</a> to run your livestreaming, and you just want a setup that is easier to disassemble and re-assemble. Maybe you are a music streamer on Twitch. You&#8217;ve done a couple of streams with your band, and you are keen to up your game with multi-camera livestreaming. Or perhaps you want to start livestreaming events that happen in various venues. In that context, Mevo Start 3-pack suddenly seems to seem like an absolute bargain. Best of all, once you get it set up the first time, it is very quick to set up and re-assemble.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the theory, at least. Taking a step back, the question becomes whether it works this well in practice.</p>
<p>Every now and again, a tech reviewer is facing an impossible task: How do you review a product that wasn&#8217;t made for you, and how do you give meaningful input on whether that product is fit for the audience it was designed for? Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App from <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/creators/products-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech for Creators</a> is precisely one of those products. I&#8217;m not a Twitch, YouTube or Facebook streamer &#8212; but on the other hand, I do have a journalism degree with a focus on broadcast journalism, and I fondly remember being trained as a news anchor and live television reporter. I was on the live link unit (i.e. the satellite van) for BBC News for a hot minute. I used to be a TV producer.</p>
<p>The problem is, when you have extensive experience in professional aspects of an industry, you approach a product with different expectations. When I was at the BBC, if the signal to the satellite dropped for even a fraction of a second in the middle of a live broadcast, you wouldn&#8217;t believe the level of stress in the RxTx (receiving and transmissions) center back at the newsroom. But, put simply, this kit isn&#8217;t designed to replace a small truck&#8217;s worth of equipment meant to broadcast breaking news to millions of people. It&#8217;s meant to make life easier for YouTube streamers.</p>

It is an excellent and elegant way to do multi-camera streaming. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On paper, the product looks like a very, very good idea &#8212; but that isn&#8217;t the same as saying that Mevo Start is perfect &#8212; it was clearly designed by people who haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time in dark clubs setting up camera equipment, and it&#8217;s obvious to me that the product team never had to set up and dismantle the kit 30 times in rapid succession. If they had, they&#8217;d have made some subtly different decisions that can have a disproportionate effect on the final product.</p>
<p>One truly stupid decision, for example, is the power button on the cameras. It is completely flush with the body, and while it is rubberized, it doesn&#8217;t have a divot on the button, or any way to find it by touch. To make matters worse, the button is matte black against a matte black camera body. Try to find that in the dark while trying to set up the cameras between two sets of musicians. To be fair to Mevo, this is often the case with the product design: It is designed in CAD packages and tested out in a brightly lit hardware lab, and only too late does someone think to set it up in the various use cases in which users might use the cameras.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231537" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231537" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231537 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231537" class="wp-caption-text">The back of the camera includes a USB-C port for power, a MicroSD card slot for local recording, a microphone input and an almost-impossible-to-find-in-the-dark power button. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Sorry to harp on about one design feature, but given it is literally the only button on the camera, it seems important. One thing I love about the power button is that it is pretty hard to press in &#8212; you have to use quite a bit of force to actuate it. That is great: It is hard to press the button by accident, and accidents are the last thing you want during a livestream. What is less great is that when you are setting something up for a livestream in a hurry, you&#8217;re going to have your hands full &#8212; I found myself needing to turn the cameras on and off with one hand regularly because I had a microphone or another piece of equipment in the other hand. That means that when you are pressing the power button on the camera, the only way to get real leverage is to hold the camera in place on the opposite side of the camera, at the same height as the power button. Unfortunately, that means that the only natural way to press the power button is to also grab the lens for leverage. I probably don&#8217;t have to spell this out, but I will anyway &#8212; the lens is literally the only part of the camera that would benefit from not having greasy fingerprints on it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231539" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231539" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231539 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231539" class="wp-caption-text">The only way to turn the camera on and off with one hand is to hold the camera like this. My fingers are pressing the button &#8212; but look at where my thumb goes. The very next thing you need to do is clear the thumbprints off your lens. Why?! <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Camera button aside, the cameras have a bunch of super-smart design features as well. There&#8217;s a small light hood to shield the dome-shaped lens from stray light, which hugely helps reducing light flares. The tripod thread can be taken out of the bottom of the camera, turning it into a much larger thread so you can fit it on a microphone or light stand. The light LED on the front of the camera uses a green LED to show which of the cameras are ready to go live &#8212; and a red one that shows which camera actually <em>is</em> live. The cameras have built-in batteries that drastically simplify the setup; you don&#8217;t need a power source to start streaming &#8212; great for on-the-go live broadcasts. All of these things are very well-thought-through features.</p>
<p>Getting the camera set up was profoundly frustrating. Straight out of the box, all three cameras needed firmware upgrades. It&#8217;s possible that this is an effect of me using an Android phone, and that the iOS version of the app is more mature, but the process ended up taking several hours of indecipherable error messages. I was finally able to get things to work, but that involved me having to restart my phone six times &#8212; once to get it to connect to each camera in the first place, then once to recover from a failed firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>I reached out to Mevo&#8217;s press team when I ran into these firmware issues. They offered to put me in touch with the development team to get me up and running. I thought about it, but decided to decline their offer. As a hardware reviewer, I get the benefit of being able to get on the phone with someone who helped build the product, but as a consumer, it&#8217;s often a very different experience.</p>
<p>If I had bought these cameras for my own use, at this point I would have returned them to Mevo: In my many years as a hardware reviewer, I have never tested out a product where I needed to restart my phone six times before I was even able to start the review process. I gave up for a few days, and when I finally was ready to put the cameras through their paces in earnest, there was another set of firmware upgrades. This time, I got through the process pretty smoothly, but having to update the camera firmware twice in a few weeks isn&#8217;t exactly encouraging.</p>
<p>The core problem is one of trust. There are a lot of products where it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have to try something twice or even three times. If you try to change the temperature on your Nest thermostat, and it doesn&#8217;t take the first time, that&#8217;s kind of okay. You try again, it works. You shrug it off. Livestreaming is not like turning on the air conditioner &#8212; when you have a couple of thousand people watching a live gig, stress levels are running high, and even the smallest technical issues can cause tremendous amounts of stress. My context for this is a live satellite link with potentially millions of viewers and a live television news broadcast getting ruined by the newsroom not getting a live report from the field. Perhaps other livestreamers are more Zen about technical issues than I am.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231540" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231540" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231540 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231540" class="wp-caption-text">One extremely welcome design touch is the removable inserts. Without the insert, it fits on a microphone stand. The insert is double threaded: one side is the size of a light stand and the other side has a tripod-size thread. Very clever indeed. Also worth noting that the cameras get fingerprint marks on them very easily &#8212; not great for product photography, but not an issue when you are using the cameras. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Once I was able to get the product set up fully, it had a chance to shine. The Mevo apps powering the cameras are outstanding. The multi-camera app lets you prepare a shot from one camera and fade between cameras. You can zoom in, use overlays and even configure digital panning movements. For what is, at its core, a pretty simple setup, you can create extraordinarily powerful results.</p>
<p>Despite my frustrated rage with the setup process, the Mevo cameras deserve a break: I tested the cameras in a number of different contexts, and they never let me down once. No hiccups, no buffering, no delays, no disconnections.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231535" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231535" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231535 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231535" class="wp-caption-text">Multi-camera streaming is perfect for creative pursuits, live music and live-action events. Mevo represents incredible value in a small package. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The problem was that I was never fully able to trust the cameras, and as a result, I would probably never use them for a livestream I care about. Would I set up a three-camera setup and do a livestream of my foster kittens playing? Absolutely, and that would be both worth watching and beyond adorable. Would I use it to livestream a friend playing a concert at a local bar to his dozens of livestreaming fans? Probably not &#8212; my stress level would be too high, and I would need to do many hours of streaming without any problems before I would even start to trust the cameras enough to rely on them for anything important.</p>
<p>And herein lies the conundrum. Livestreaming is so high-stakes and stressful that it&#8217;s crucial that you feel that you can trust your equipment. Part of building that trust is the first-use experience with a product, and Mevo&#8217;s cameras were some of the worst devices I have ever reviewed in that respect. But the flip side is also true: The life of a reviewer is that you see devices with their first versions of the firmware, and with software that was maybe not <em>quite</em> ready for prime time yet. I am willing to accept that Mevo might be able to sort out the problems I found in my review and that three or six months from now, the cameras will be great.</p>
<p>O<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n paper and in theory, at least, they could be a cost-effective and near-perfect solution for livestreamers who want to dip their toes in the multi-cam world. I would have to revisit the product in a few months to know whether or not to recommend it. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group is hemorrhaging money. During the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call, Workhorse reported an <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2602c9bad137b59411e9819ecc4d09aa/workhorse/news/2021-11-09_Workhorse_Group_Reports_Third_Quarter_2021_185.pdf">$81 million loss</a>, blaming an increase in operating costs and a suspension of production due to recalls. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600, which is largely related to refunds issued to customers who had their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/workhorse-group-suspends-deliveries-recalls-c-1000-electric-delivery-van/">C-1000 cargo delivery vans recalled</a> due to safety issues.</p>
<p>Workhorse sold 41 vans this year before it had finished ensuring the design was in compliance with federal safety standards set by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The company was forced to suspend sales in order to complete testing, recall all of the vehicles and slow production to two trucks per week.</p>
<p>Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch admitted on Tuesday that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. The company is performing additional testing of the current truck design, which Dauch said is presently &#8220;not robust nor is it profitable.&#8221; What&#8217;s more likely to happen is that Workhorse will scrap it and reconfigure the van&#8217;s design altogether, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps">something the company said it might do back in August</a>. Workhorse said it expects to provide a production forecast early next year, even going so far as to promise delivery of &#8220;best-in-class vehicles for the commercial electric vehicle market starting in 2023.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That might be hard to do without raising more money from investors who are likely wary of empty promises. Dauch took the helm of Workhorse in July when the company was chaotically trying to ship its non-compliant vehicles that were built with parts bought via online auctions from Asia. Dauch acknowledged that he inherited a company plagued by poor leadership and a lack of communication, with a cash burn rate that was not only unsustainable, but also downright detrimental. Workhorse&#8217;s supply chain was, and remains, not yet Tier 1 qualified and it lacks a range of systems for production, which in all fairness is common for a startup, says Dauch.</p>
<p>Workhorse is also currently under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. The SEC probe is related to trading in the company&#8217;s securities before the award of a United States Postal Service contract to build the agency&#8217;s next-generation mail truck — Workhorse ended up not winning that bid, which caused its shares to plummet. The Justice Department&#8217;s investigation is &#8220;related&#8221; to the SEC probe, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/energy-environment/workhorse-electric-vehicle-earnings.html">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p id="sDpV9v">Despite powerful headwinds, Dauch thinks Workhorse is still poised for success in large part due to macroeconomic trends and regulatory factors that are driving future growth. The pandemic only solidified the importance in e-commerce that the entire world is experiencing. With tightening government emissions regulations and the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html">passing of the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, the need for electric delivery vans will only grow. No one has yet cornered this market, so Workhorse thinks it still has time to get itself together and take a slice of that pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have near-term financial flexibility based on our improved balance sheet and reduced monthly cash consumption rate,&#8221; said Dauch during the conference call, also noting Workhorse&#8217;s &#8220;solid purchase orders&#8221; and &#8220;strong customer support.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the third quarter of 2021, Workhorse&#8217;s selling, general and administrative expenses — which include &#8220;higher compensation-related costs due to increased headcount, severance pay, stock-based compensation, legal costs and insurance costs&#8221; — increased to $10.6 million compared to $6 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>In June, Workhorse filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the USPS for awarding its contract to defense contractor Oshkosh Defense. Workhorse had been fighting for this coveted spot since 2015. The startup dropped the lawsuit in September, probably after it had a look at its balance sheet and realized it couldn&#8217;t afford to take USPS to court. Indeed, during the earnings call, Workhorse CFO Greg Ackerson pointed to dropping the lawsuit as one of the key actions taken to reduce spending.</p>
<p>Workhorse also converted $172.5 million of debt into equity, slowed inbound material, eliminated air freight and reduced consulting by adding in-house expertise, according to Ackerson. That said, the startup&#8217;s R&amp;D expenses increased to $2.8 million compared to $1.6 million in Q3 of 2020, which was related mainly to increased headcount and higher consulting costs. Presumably, Workhorse needs to spend a little more on talent in order to get a functioning, and safe, electric van that&#8217;s ready for production before the company loses its &#8220;loyal&#8221; customer base.</p>
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Workhorse’s stock was down 3.6% at the close on Tuesday afternoon and trading at $6.64. Shares have fallen more than 80% since February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it will no longer allow advertisers to target users based on potentially &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics like health, sexual orientation, or religious and political beliefs. &#8220;Lung cancer awareness,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT culture&#8221; and &#8220;Jewish holidays&#8221; are just some of the interest categories that will no longer be targeted starting early next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, saying input from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders contributed to its decision. Advertising revenue is Facebook&#8217;s leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/">source of income</a>, so any major change to ad policy can have significant ramifications.</p>
<p>Facebook can target users based on information provided in their profile, like their age, location or gender. But the platform never made it possible to target people based on the sexual orientation listed in their profile, a representative from the company told TechCrunch. Rather, the advertising that will be removed refers to ads that are served based on your profile&#8217;s interest categories.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook assigns these interest categories to your profile based on your activity. Based on how you engage with Facebook content, you might be assigned categories that Facebook would call &#8220;sensitive,&#8221; like &#8220;American Jewish culture,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT rights&#8221; or &#8220;Barack Obama.&#8221; Starting January 19, advertisers will no longer be able to target their ads based on interests like these. Other interest groups like &#8220;rock climbing&#8221; and &#8220;knitting,&#8221; not being sensitive, will still be targetable &#8212; there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/meta-facebook-ad-targeting.html">tens of thousands</a> of these categories, sensitive or not.</p>
<p>Users can see their profile&#8217;s interest groups by navigating on desktop to Settings and Privacy &gt; Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Ad Settings &gt; Categories used to reach you &gt; Interest Categories. If you don&#8217;t want to receive ads based on a certain interest, you can opt out.</p>
<p>This change in ad policy comes as Meta &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">newly renamed</a> parent company to the Facebook platform &#8212; faces increased scrutiny after a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">senate hearings</a> related to documents leaked by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower</a> Frances Haugen. As more documents are leaked to the press, Meta has gone on the defensive, claiming that some journalists&#8217; reporting has <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972">misrepresented</a> its actions.</p>
<p>But Facebook&#8217;s ad policy has been a topic of concern for years. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election in 2020, Facebook placed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-to-block-new-political-ads-1-week-before-nov-3-adds-more-tools-and-rules-for-fair-elections/">limitations</a> on the kinds of political ads that could be created. In 2018, Facebook conducted a similar removal of over 5,000 targeting options for ads after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_085">complaint</a> against Facebook that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/19/hud-complaint-accuses-facebook-ads-of-violating-fair-housing-act/">accused it of helping</a> landlords and home sellers violate the Fair Housing Act. Before that, in 2016, Facebook disabled &#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ProPublica report</a> suggested that these capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising. When it comes to housing and employment, it&#8217;s illegal to target ads based on certain demographics. Another <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters">report from ProPublica</a> spurred Facebook to remove ad targeting based on anti-Semitic interest categories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to better match people’s evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls">blog post</a>. &#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Facebook said it made these decisions based on concerns about how data could be abused by bad actors, there are instances in which this data could be used in a potentially positive way, which worried some stakeholders. For example, if someone was interested in &#8220;Diabetes awareness,&#8221; they could be connected with nonprofits working to treat the condition.</p>
<p>Still, Facebook offers businesses a number of tools to access a specific audience. If users are opted into ad tracking on an iPhone, for example, Facebook advertisers can use that information for ad targeting. Businesses can also leverage <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1090330204367211?id=2469097953376494&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=ENGAGEMENT%20CUSTOM%20AUDIENCES">engagement custom audiences</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=lookalike%20audiences">lookalike audiences</a> and other techniques for reaching users, as the company outlines in its blog post.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition and its second in 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand delivery giant DoorDash announced Tuesday it was acquiring food delivery company Wolt in an all-stock deal valued at €7 billion, or $8.1 billion.</p>
<p>Talking about the acquisition, Tony Xu, co-founder and CEO of DoorDash said in a statement that the move “will accelerate our product development, bring greater focus to each of our markets and improve the value we provide to consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers and couriers around the world.”</p>
<p>Finland-based Wolt was founded in 2014 by Miki Kuusi, who, upon the deal closing, will run DoorDash International and report to Xu. The company has over 4,000 employees across 23 countries and its technology enables users to easily discover and receive food via its platform by selecting a restaurant, placing the order and hitting send.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wolt has raised over $850 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wolt/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to its Crunchbase profile</a>. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/wolt-closes-530m-round-to-continue-expanding-beyond-restaurant-delivery/">most recent funding round was $530 million</a> in January, led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, EQT Growth and Coatue.</p>
<p>Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a> and its second in 2021, which includes an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">acquisition of Chowbotics</a> earlier this year. The latest transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>DoorDash was one of the benefactors of the global pandemic, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing to set records</a> for orders and the value of those orders as reported in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/airbnb-doordash-report-earnings-as-covid-threatens-to-slow-the-irl-economy-again/">second-quarter earnings</a> for the three-month period ending June 30. However, the company was unprofitable overall with a net loss of $102 million for the quarter.</p>
