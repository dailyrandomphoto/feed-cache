										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China is pushing forward an internet society where economic and public activities increasingly take place online. In the process, troves of citizen and government data get transferred to cloud servers, raising concerns over information security. One startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threatbook/company_financials">ThreatBook</a> sees an opportunity in this revolution and pledges to protect corporations and bureaucracies against malicious cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Antivirus and security software has been around in China for several decades, but until recently, enterprises were procuring them simply to meet compliance requests, Xue Feng, founder and CEO of six-year-old ThreatBook, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Starting around 2014, internet accessibility began to expand rapidly in China, ushering in an explosion of data. Information previously stored in physical servers was moving to the cloud. Companies realized that a cyber attack could result in a substantial financial loss and started to pay serious attention to security solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, cyberspace is emerging as a battlefield where competition between states plays out. Malicious actors may target a country&#8217;s critical digital infrastructure or steal key research from a university database.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of cyberattacks between countries is reflective of their geopolitical relationships,&#8221; observed Xue, who oversaw information security at Amazon China before founding ThreatBook. Previously, he was the director of internet security at Microsoft in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;If two countries are allies, they are less likely to attack one another. China has a very special position in geopolitics. Besides its tensions with the other superpowers, cyberattacks from smaller, nearby countries are also common.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other emerging SaaS companies, ThreatBook sells software and charges a subscription fee for annual services. More than 80% of its current customers are big corporations in finance, energy, the internet industry, and manufacturing. Government contracts make up a smaller slice. With its Series E funding round that closed 500 million yuan ($76 million) in March, ThreatBook boosted its total capital raised to over 1 billion yuan from investors including Hillhouse Capital.</p>
<p>Xue declined to disclose the company&#8217;s revenues or valuation but said 95% of the firm&#8217;s customers have chosen to renew their annual subscriptions. He added that the company has met the &#8220;preliminary requirements&#8221; of the Shanghai Exchange&#8217;s STAR board,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> China&#8217;s equivalent to NASDAQ</a>, and will go public when the conditions are ripe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes our peers 7-10 years to go public,&#8221; said Xue.</p>
<p>ThreatBook compares itself to CrowdStrike from Silicon Valley, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">which filed to go public in 2019</a> and detect threats by monitoring a company&#8217;s &#8220;endpoints&#8221;, which could be an employee&#8217;s laptops and mobile devices that connect to the internal network from outside the corporate firewall.</p>
<p>ThreatBook similarly has a suite of software that goes onto the devices of a company&#8217;s employees, automatically detects threats and comes up with a list of solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like installing a lot of security cameras inside a company,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;But the thing that matters is what we tell customers after we capture issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>SaaS providers in China are still in the phase of educating the market and lobbying enterprises to pay. Of the 3,000 companies that ThreatBook serves, only 300 are paying so there is plentiful room for monetization. Willingness to spend also differs across sectors, with financial institutions happy to shell out several million yuan ($1 = 6.54 yuan) a year while a tech startup may only want to pay a fraction of that.</p>
<p>Xue&#8217;s vision is to take ThreatBook global. The company had plans to expand overseas last year but was held back by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a handful of inquiries from companies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. There may even be room for us in markets with mature [cybersecurity companies] like Europe and North America,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;As long as we are able to offer differentiation, a customer may still consider us even if it has an existing security solution.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Patreon has tripled its valuation to $4 billion in a $155 million funding round led by Tiger Global, the company confirmed to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/patreons-valuation-triples-to-4-billion-as-creators-and-fans-flock-to-platform-11617762374">Wall Street Journal</a> on Tuesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The creator economy platform, which allows artists to be directly funded by their fans, received new attention amid the Covid-19 pandemic as creators were forced to push more of their work online. The creator payments space has seen a multitude of new entrants in recent months but the eight-year-old Patreon has already built up an extensive network. In a blog post last year, Patreon noted that more than 30,000 creators signed up for the service in the first weeks of March 2020.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Patreon makes money by taking a 5-12 percent fee from creators depending on which of the company&#8217;s services they use. The company wrapped a $90 million round in September that valued the company at $1.2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Other investors in this new round include Woodline Partners, Wellington Management, Lone Pine Capital and New Enterprise Associates, the report notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook faces questions over data breach</strong></p>
<p>A data breach involving personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) of more than 500 million Facebook accounts came to light over the weekend thanks to a story <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">in Business Insider</a>. Although Facebook said the breach was related to a vulnerability that was &#8220;found and fixed&#8221; in August 2019, the Irish Data Protection Commission — Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the European Union — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">suggested that it&#8217;s seeking the &#8220;full facts&#8221; in the matter</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period,” said deputy commissioner Graham Doyle in a statement. &#8220;A significant number of the users are EU users. Much of the data appears to been data scraped some time ago from Facebook public profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, it looks like EU regulators may also look into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of customer service company Kustomer</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Encrypted chat app Signal is <a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/">adding payments</a> to the services it provides, a long-expected move and one the company is taking its time on. A U.K.-only beta program will allow users to trade the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a> quickly, easily, and most importantly, privately.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the U.K., or have some way to appear to be, you&#8217;ll notice a new Signal Payments feature in the app when you update. All you need to do to use it is link a MobileCoin wallet after you buy some on the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the only one that lists it right now.</p>
<p>Once you link up, you&#8217;ll be able to instantly send MOB to anyone else with a linked wallet, pretty much as easily as you&#8217;d send a chat. (No word on when the beta will expand to other countries or currencies.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as Signal doesn&#8217;t have any kind of access to the messages you send or calls you make, your payments are totally private. MobileCoin, which Signal has been working with for a couple years now, was built from the ground up for speed and privacy, using a zero-knowledge proof system and other innovations to make it as easy as Venmo but as secure as … well, Signal. You can read more about their approach <a href="https://github.com/UkoeHB/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin/blob/master/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin-v0-0-39-preview-10-11.pdf">in this paper (PDF)</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency advised early on by Signal&#8217;s Moxie Marlinspike, has raised venture funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/embed/#?secret=Vo0MdYZVEl" data-secret="Vo0MdYZVEl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MobileCoin just snagged a little over $11 million in funding last month as rumors swirled that this integration was nearing readiness. Further whispers propelled the value of MOB into the stratosphere as well, nice for those holding it but not for people who want to use it to pay someone back for a meal. All of a sudden you&#8217;ve given your friend a Benjamin (or perhaps now, in the U.K., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/computing-pioneer-and-lgbt-icon-alan-turing-will-grace-the-50-note-in-2021/">a Turing</a>) for no good reason, or that the sandwich has depreciated precipitously since lunchtime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason you <em>have</em> to hold the currency, of course, but swapping it for stable or fiat currencies every time seems a chore. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/">Speaking to Wired</a>, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike envisioned an automatic trade-out system, though he is rarely so free with information like that if it is something under active development.</p>
<p>While there is some risk that getting involved with cryptocurrency, with the field&#8217;s mixed reputation, may dilute or pollute the goodwill Signal has developed as a secure and disinterested service provider, the team there seems to think it&#8217;s inevitable. After all, if popular payment services are being monitored the same way your email and social media are, perhaps we ought to nip this one in the bud and go end-to-end encrypted as quickly as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of Democratic lawmakers wrote to Mark Zuckerberg this week to press the CEO on his plans to curate a version of Instagram for children. In a hearing last month, Zuckerberg confirmed<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"> reporting by BuzzFeed</a> that the company was exploring an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-congress-hearing-exploring-instagram-kids/7001956002/">age-gated version of its app</a> designed for young users.</p>
<p>Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Representatives Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Kathy Castor (D-FL) signed the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/instagram_kids_letter.pdf">letter</a>, expressing &#8220;serious concerns&#8221; about the company&#8217;s ability to protect the privacy and well-being of young users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has an obligation to ensure that any new platforms or projects targeting children put those users’ welfare first, and we are skeptical that Facebook is prepared to fulfill this obligation,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They cited previous failures with products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/facebook-messenger-kids/">Messenger Kids</a>, which had a flaw that allowed kids to chat with people beyond their privacy parameters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although software bugs are common, this episode illustrated the privacy threats to children online and evidenced Facebook’s inability to protect the kids the company actively invited onto this platform,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=mn21Ajb9vB" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In light of these and other previous privacy and security issues on Facebook’s platforms, we are not confident that Facebook will be able to adequately protect children’s privacy on a version of Instagram for young users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter set a deadline of April 26 for the company to provide answers to a comprehensive and helpfully specific set of questions about a future kid-targeted product.</p>
<p>In the letter, lawmakers posed a number of questions about how Facebook will handle the private data for young users and if that data would be deleted when an account is terminated. They also asked the company to commit to not targeting kids with ads and not employing push alerts and behavior-shaping features designed to make apps more addictive.</p>
<p>During last month&#8217;s big tech hearing in the House, committee members from both political parties grilled Zuckerberg about how Facebook and Instagram adversely affect mental health in young users. Rep. Castor also pressed the chief executive about underage users who circumvent Instagram&#8217;s existing age guidelines to use a platform full of posts, videos and ads designed for adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, every parent knows there are kids under the age of 13 on Instagram, and the problem is that you know it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the first quarter of 2021, American consumer cryptocurrency trading giant <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> grew sharply, generating strong profits at the same time.</p>
<p>For Coinbase, the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406006015/en/">disclosure</a> of its preliminary Q1 2021 results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/coinbase-to-direct-list-on-april-14th-provide-financial-update-on-april-6th/">comes a week ahead</a> of its direct listing, an event that will see the company begin to trade publicly. As it is both cash rich and well known, Coinbase is foregoing a traditional IPO in favor of the more exotic method of going public.</p>
<p>In its release, Coinbase disclosed the following metrics, which TechCrunch has compared to metrics from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly transacting users (MTUs)</strong> of 6.1 million, up from 2.8 million at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Platform assets</strong> of $223 billion, up from $90.3 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Trading volume</strong> of $335 billion, up from $193.1 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> of $1.8 billion, up from $585.1 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Net income</strong> of &#8220;approximately $730 million to $800 million,&#8221; up from $178.8 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong> of &#8220;approximately $1.1 billion,&#8221; up from $287.7 million in Q4 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>The growth of Coinbase from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 is so extreme that the company&#8217;s year-over-year comparisons are farcical. For example, in Q1 2020 Coinbase&#8217;s revenues were $190.6 million, or just under 11% of its Q1 2021 top line. The company&#8217;s adjusted profits alone in Q1 2021 were more than five times its year-ago revenues.</p>
<p>The new numbers may help solidify some valuation marks that the company has been discussed as approaching, like the $100 billion threshold, or even boost them.</p>
<p>The company did present some warnings in its public release, noting that cryptocurrency price &#8220;cycles can be highly volatile, and as a result, [Coinbase] measure[s] [its] performance over price cycles in lieu of quarterly results.&#8221; The company also stated that future declines in crypto trading activity will not slow its investment:</p>
<blockquote><p>MTUs, Trading Volume, and therefore transaction revenue currently fluctuate, potentially materially, with Bitcoin price and crypto asset volatility. This revenue unpredictability, in turn, impacts our profitability on a quarter-to-quarter basis. <strong>In terms of expenses, we intend to prioritize investment, including in periods where we may see a decrease in Bitcoin price.</strong> This is because we believe that scale is central to achieving our mission and it is still early in the development of this industry. <em><strong>[Emphasis: TechCrunch]</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Or more simply, it is willing to sacrifice future profitability if its revenues decline, as it is building for the future instead of hewing to more near-term investor expectations. At least Coinbase is being clear in its messaging to investors: Don&#8217;t buy Coinbase stock expecting the company to tune its results to quarterly expectations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XadpEXQcUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=XadpEXQcUo" data-secret="XadpEXQcUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking ahead, Coinbase did provide some guidance for its full-year results. For 2021, the company provided three scenarios. The first &#8220;assumes an increase in crypto market capitalization and moderate-to-high crypto asset price volatility,&#8221; leading to 7 million MTUs. The second &#8220;assumes flat crypto market capitalization and low-to-moderate crypto asset price volatility&#8221; and 5.5 million MTUs. The third &#8220;assumes a significant decrease in crypto market capitalization, similar to the decrease observed in 2018, and low levels of crypto asset price volatility thereafter&#8221; and 4 million MTUs for the year.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t think that Coinbase is anticipation stagnant growth, simply because its best scenario anticipates mere growth from 6.1 million MTUs to 7 million MTUs. The company wrote in its release under the headline &#8220;institutional revenue&#8221; that it expects &#8220;meaningful growth in 2021 driven by transaction and custody revenue given the increased institutional interest in the crypto asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s quarter was bonkers good. But so was the performance of cryptocurrencies themselves. A bet on the company&#8217;s shares, then, could easily be seen as a bet on the value of bitcoin and its ilk. April 14 is going to be a fun day to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based Rapid Robotics today <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/06/2204842/0/en/NEA-leads-12M-Series-A-in-Rapid-Robotics-amid-US-manufacturing-resurgence.html">announced a $12 million Series A</a>. The new round, led by NEA, brings the company’s total funding up to $17.5 million. It joins a recently closed seed round, announced way back in November of last year. Existing investors Greycroft, Bee Partners and 468 Capital also took part in the round.</p>
<p>We noted at that stage that COVID-19 had a sizable impact on robotics investment. At the very least, the pandemic has served to accelerate interest in automation, as many “non-essential” workers have been unable to travel to their jobs. At present, manufacturing jobs often lack the ability to perform remotely.</p>
<p>Rapid notes that the company’s tech has been involved with the production of some 50 million parts over the past year, over a wide variety of different manufacturing verticals. And, like his predecessor, President Biden has already begun talking up strategies to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Of course, ambitious as it might be, any plan is going to have to be a balancing act between human jobs and automation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company notes the longstanding issue with human operators in these roles. “If we don’t solve this problem, U.S. manufacturers will never be able to compete in a global market,” CEO Jordan Kretchmer said in a release. “It’s really that simple.”</p>
<p>Rapid’s main value add here is ease of use. The company creates systems designed to get up and running quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has launched a new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my-certification-asst/id1532296125">Find My Certification Asst.</a>, designed for use by MFi (Made for iPhone) Licensees, who need to test their accessories&#8217; interoperability with Apple&#8217;s Find My network. The network helps users find lost Apple devices &#8212; like iPhones, AirPods and Mac computers, among other things &#8212; but is poised to add support for finding other compatible accessories manufactured by third parties.</p>
<p>The launch of the testing app signals that Apple may be ready to announce the launch of the third-party device program in the near future.</p>
<p>According to the app&#8217;s description, MFi Licensees can use Find My Certification Asst. to test the &#8220;discovery, connection and other key requirements&#8221; for their accessories that will incorporate Apple&#8217;s Find My network technology. It also points to information about the Find My network certification program on Apple&#8217;s MFi Portal at <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">mfi.apple.com</a>, which currently references Find My network as a MFi program technology that&#8217;s &#8220;launching soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new app&#8217;s screenshots indicate it allows device makers to run a wide variety of tests in areas like connectivity, sound (for example, if the item can make a noise when misplaced), firmware, key management, NFC, power and more.</p>

<p>The app became publicly available on Sunday, April 4 on the iOS App Store, according to Sensor Tower data. It&#8217;s brand new so is not yet ranking in any App Store categories, including its own, &#8220;Developer Tools,&#8221; or others. It also has no ratings and reviews at this time.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s launch is step toward the larger goal of opening up the Apple Find My network to third parties and Apple&#8217;s planned launch of its own new accessory, AirTags.</p>
<p>Apple at last year&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking">had first announced</a> it would open up Find My to third-party devices after facing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">pressure from regulators</a> in the U.S. and Europe who had been looking into, among other things, whether Apple had been planning to give itself an advantage with its forthcoming launch of AirTags, a competitor to Tile&#8217;s lost-item finder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134629" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134629" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134629" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134629" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of FMCA app</p></div></p>
<p>A prominent Apple critic, Tile had complained that AirTags would be able to connect with Apple&#8217;s U1 chips, which use UWB (ultra-wideband) technology for more precise finding capabilities, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">at a Congressional hearing noted</a> that AirTags would work with Apple&#8217;s own Find My app, which ships by default on Apple devices. This, Tile believed, would give Apple a first-party advantage in the lost-item finder market that Tile had successfully established and dominated for years.</p>
<p>Apple, in response, opened up <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework">third-party developer access</a> to its U1 chip via its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction">&#8220;NearbyInteraction&#8221;</a> framework last year. As a result, Tile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">in Jan. 2021 announced</a> its plan to launch a new tracker powered by UWB.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-enables-new-items-tab-in-find-my-to-track-airtags-and-third-party-accessories/">Apple updated its Find My app</a> to include a new tab called &#8220;Items&#8221; in preparation for the app&#8217;s expanded support for AirTags and other third-party accessories, like those from Tile and others. This &#8220;Items&#8221; tab is enabled in latest Apple&#8217;s iOS 14.5 beta release, where the app explains how the Find My app will now be able to help users keep track of their everyday items &#8212; including accessories and other items that are compatible with Find My.</p>
<p>However, Tile (and likely others) feel that Apple&#8217;s concessions still disadvantage their businesses because participation in Apple&#8217;s FindMy program means that the third-party device maker would have to abandon its existing app and instead require its customers to use Apple&#8217;s FindMy app &#8212; effectively turning over its customers and their data to Apple.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, upon launch, the app features an icon that shows three items: headphones, a backpack and a suitcase. Not coincidentally, perhaps, Tile&#8217;s first integrations were with Bose headphones and luggage and bag makers, Away and Herschel.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded to a request for comment about the new app&#8217;s launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries in a small and growing market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don&#8217;t produce tailpipe emissions, they&#8217;re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs. But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the average electric vehicle lithium-ion battery can retain up to 70% of its charging capacity after being removed. The business proposition for second-life batteries is therefore intuitive: Before sending the battery to a recycler, automakers can potentially generate additional revenue by putting it to use in another application or selling it to a third party.</p>
<p>Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.</p>
<p>To name only a few such projects that have popped up in recent years, Nissan is using old batteries to power small robots; French carmaker Groupe Renault, with partners, is launching stationary energy storage systems made with old EV batteries; and Audi Environmental Foundation, the daughter organization of Audi AG, worked with Indian startup Nunam to build solar nanogrids out of used e-tron battery modules.</p>
<p>Other OEMs, like Lucid Motors, BMW and Proterra, are incorporating reuse principles into their battery design. In fact, Lucid has built its batteries to work across its electric vehicle and energy storage products, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/">including in second-life uses</a>, Chief Engineer Eric Bach told TechCrunch. And BMW has used a &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; concept with the batteries in its i3 model so that they can be easily removed and inserted into second-life applications, BMW spokesperson Weiland Bruch said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We believe that battery second-life will become its own self-standing business field,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>A new lease on battery life</h2>
<p>Automakers are increasingly bullish on second-life uses, though the size of their role in this budding market is still unclear. Matthew Lumsden, CEO of U.K.-based Connected Energy, told TechCrunch that he has noticed a shift in the past two years where some OEMs have begun viewing batteries as an asset rather than a liability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in a twist, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced a proposal for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black and Latinx Seed Fund will be administered by the New Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said based on research conducted by the state, that New Jersey is the first state in the nation to develop this type of fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the move is a “direct response </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the systemic racial inequities in access to capital for Black and brown entrepreneurs” and aimed at addressing “the racial wealth gap.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think two of the centerpieces of Gov. Murphy&#8217;s strategy overall for the economy is to build a stronger and fairer New Jersey and a stronger and fairer economy,” Sullivan said, adding that the state is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also focused on “reclaiming New Jersey&#8217;s heritage of leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a known fact that the number of venture dollars flowing to Black and Latinx founders is dismally low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one evidence of that, last year </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/2020-diversity-spotlight-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that as of Aug. 31, Black and Latinx founders had raised $2.3 billion in funding, representing just 2.6% of the total $87.3 billion in funding that had gone to all founders up until that point in 2020.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Digitalundivided’s ProjectDiane 2020 report found that Black and Latinx women founders received just $1.7 billion of the total $276.7 billion venture dollars invested between 2018 and 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several months &#8212; in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement &#8212; we’ve seen an increasing number of venture funds </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announce initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward funding a broader group of founders.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aEylX7Nexb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before there was a Silicon Valley, whether you&#8217;re talking about folks like Thomas Edison, Bell Labs or Sarnoff Labs, we were the place that perhaps more than any other place that fueled 20th century American entrepreneurial-led growth,” Sullivan told TechCrunch. “And the reality is that we lost a little bit of that. We&#8217;re still one of the top places for innovation and entrepreneurship, but other places &#8211;whether it&#8217;s out west or in places like Austin and Boston &#8212; have really upped their game and we want to recapture that unquestioned leadership position in innovation, entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that — under Gov. Murphy&#8217;s leadership — the state wants “to build the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a lot easier said than done, particularly because of not only centuries worth of systemic discrimination and racism, but some very specific manifestations of that systemic disenfranchisement and discrimination, particularly around venture capital funding and early-stage seed funding,” added Sullivan, who once worked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Barclays Capital as chief of staff to the head of Global Investment Banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zakiya Smith Ellis, chief policy advisor to Gov. Murphy, said the initiative came after conversations with Black and Latinx business investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was developed with the input of folks who might be direct beneficiaries of this program and that community was directly impactful in designing and developing this proposal,” Smith Ellis told TechCrunch. “We hear from them ‘we don&#8217;t have the family members, we don&#8217;t have the friends who are just going to write me a check at the very beginning, I think this is really instructive.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature is set to vote on the proposal by July 1.</span><b></b></p>
<p>While it was difficult to find examples of governments doing similar things, there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p>In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals &#8220;of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (<em>Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company</em>).</p>
<p>And, Detroit-based ID Ventures says it invests in minority and women-led companies &#8220;at 4x the national average.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By providing opportunities to underrepresented entrepreneurs, we can ensure representation, respect our state’s diversity, and create a startup community unlike any other,&#8221; the organization&#8217;s website says.</p>
<p>Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders. Founded in 2016 by former Dell executive Preston James, the organization aims to &#8220;e<span class="lt-line-clamp__line">mpower people of color and women entrepreneurs and help them build successful </span><span class="lt-line-clamp__line">high-growth businesses by providing them with access to education, mentorship and vital networks.&#8221;</span></p>

The free app, called <a href="https://mem.ai/">Mem</a>, is an early access platform dedicated to pushing users to quickly jot down their thoughts without focusing too heavily on the underlying organization of them. The startup&#8217;s founders have vast ambitions for what their platform could become down the road, tapping into further advances in machine learning and even AR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really the differentiation is [information] that is summonable ubiquitously wherever you are,&#8221; Mem co-founder Kevin Moody tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So, in the near term, through your desktop app with Mem Spotlight as a heads-up display for wherever you are, in the medium term through an assistive mobile application, and then in the long term, imagine contact lenses that are overlaying useful content to you in the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moody and his co-founder Dennis Xu tell TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $5.6 million in a seed round led by a16z with additional participation from their Cultural Leadership Fund, Will Smith&#8217;s dreamers.vc, Floodgate, Unusual Ventures and Shrug Capital. The round also was host to a handful of angel investors including Harry Stebbings, Julia Lipton, Tony Liu, Rahul Vohra and Todd Goldberg, among others.</p>
<p>In its current iteration, Mem push users towards &#8220;lightweight organization&#8221; rather than clicking through folders and links to find the perfect place to nestle their thoughts. Users can quickly tag users or dedicated topics in their notes. The user workflow relies pretty heavily on search and chronological organization, presenting users with their most recently accessed notes. Users can also set reminders for certain notes, bringing a popular email framework to note-taking.</p>
<p>For users of stock apps like Apple Notes, these interface quirks may not sound very jarring, though the design is still a departure from apps like Notion and Airtable which have heavily focused on structure over immediacy.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mem&#8217;s biggest shift is how users access the information they&#8217;ve dumped into the platform. The founders say they want to avoid their app being seen as a &#8220;destination,&#8221; instead hoping users rely heavily on a keyboard-shortcut-prompted overlay called Mem Spotlight that allows them to search out information that they may need for an email, presentation or text message. The broader hope of the founders and investors behind Mem is that the team can leverage the platform&#8217;s intelligence over time to better understand the data dump from your brain &#8212; and likely other information sources across your digital footprint &#8212; to know you better than any ad network or social media graph does.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would it mean to just capture passively your digital footprint and then make use of that as though it were structured,&#8221; Moody posits. &#8220;If we can actually have our own Mem modeling of all of these entities, whether it&#8217;s text, or maybe it&#8217;s contacts, the people that you know, or it&#8217;s the events that you&#8217;re going to and these different sources feed into Mem, what would it mean for Mem to be able to have a product that is the &#8216;you&#8217; API?&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the startup&#8217;s app isn&#8217;t quite as grandiose in scale as what the founders may see in its future, but as Mem continues to onboard early users from its waitlist and add to its desktop functionality, the company is driving towards a platform they hope feels more instrumental to how its users &#8220;remember&#8221; information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wisk Aero, the air mobility company borne out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Archer Aviation alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<p>Wisk claims in the lawsuit that Archer perpetrated a “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. The lawsuit points to the design of Archer&#8217;s first electric aircraft that was released in February, which Wisk says is a copy of one of its potential designs. That design was submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in January 2020, and Wisk alleges the similarities are too numerous to have been a coincidence.</p>
<p>Wisk further claims that during a forensic investigation it opened after Archer hired 10 former Wisk engineers, one of those hires secretly downloaded thousands of files before his departure. Another engineer also downloaded files, the suit alleges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The information contained in the stolen files includes systems designs, test data and aircraft designs, Wisk <a href="https://wisk.aero/blog/040621-blog-post/">said in a blog posted Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>“As our Complaint explains, the design Archer disclosed above reflects its insider knowledge of Wisk’s extensive aerodynamic test and evaluation data based on years of experimentation and modeling,” the company said in the blog post. “The similarity in overall aircraft design further indicates Archer’s use of more detailed design features, including features related to aircraft propulsion, power management, avionics, flight control and manufacturing methodology.”</p>
<p>Archer has snagged some major wins in 2021, including an announcement in February that it would merge with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp. for an equity valuation of $3.8 billion. Also in February, the Palo Alto, California-based startup landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">a $1 billion order</a> with United Airlines as a customer and investor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s regrettable that Wisk would engage in litigation in an attempt to deflect from the business issues that have caused several of its employees to depart,&#8221; an Archer spokesperson said in an email to TechCrunch. The plaintiff raised these matters over a year ago, and after looking into them thoroughly, we have no reason to believe any proprietary Wisk technology ever made its way to Archer.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Archer spokesperson added that the company has &#8220;placed an employee on paid administrative leave in connection with a government investigation and a search warrant issued to the employee, which we believe are focused on conduct prior to the employee joining the company. Archer and three other Archer employees with whom the individual worked also have received subpoenas relating to this investigation, and all are fully cooperating with the authorities.”</p>
<p>In response to the news of a criminal investigation, a Wisk spokesperson said, &#8220;We are aware of Archer’s disclosure of a criminal investigation into this matter and are fully cooperating with the government. We have no further comment at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit was filed with the California Northern District Court under case no. 5:21-cv-02450.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated to include additional comment from Wisk on the criminal investigation. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is adding an electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck to its lineup, as the automaker pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.</p>
<p>GM President Mark Reuss said Tuesday that the Chevrolet Silverado electric full-size pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and will have an estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge. It should be noted this is GM&#8217;s forecast not an official EPA figure.</p>
<p>GM is positioning the full-sized pickup for both consumer and commercial markets. Reuss said that retail and fleet versions of the Silverado electric pickup will be offered with a variety of options and configurations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m particularly excited about its potential in the fleet and commercial space, a crucial part of the EV market, especially initially,&#8221; Reuss said during a presentation at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck.</p>
<p>The electric Silverado will go head to head with Ford&#8217;s upcoming electric F-150. While new EV entrant Rivian is not going after the commercial market, its electric R1T pickup will also provide competition in the space. Rivian is expected to begin deliveries of its electric R1T pickup truck this summer.</p>
<p>The news also follows a string of announcements over the past 18 months, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">GM&#8217;s Ultium battery platform</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launch of BrightDrop</a>, an a new business unit to offer commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products. BrightDrop will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1.</p>
<p>Last year, GM committed more than $27 billion to EV and AV product development, including $7 billion in 2021 and plans to launch 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds available in North America.</p>
<p>Reuss said that the company will build the Silverado electric pickup truck at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan. He confirmed that the GMC Hummer EV SUV, which was unveiled over the weekend, will also be built at the factory. GM renamed its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant &#8220;Factory ZERO&#8221; in October 2020 and later said it would invest $2.2 billion in the factory to produce a variety of all-electric trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>The facility, which is is undergoing a complete renovation and retooling and has expanded to more than 4.5 million square feet, will also produce the GMC Hummer EV pickup and the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built, all-electric and shared self-driving vehicle. Production of the GMC Hummer EV pickup will begin later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Esri</a>, the geographic information system (GIS), mapping and spatial analytics company, is hosting its (virtual) <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/overview">developer summit today</a>. Unsurprisingly, it is making a couple of major announcements at the event that range from a new design system and improved JavaScript APIs to support for running <a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/">ArcGIS Enterprise</a> in containers on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes project was a major undertaking for the company, <span class="il">Esri</span> Product Managers Trevor Seaton and Philip Heede told me. Traditionally, like so many similar products, ArcGIS was architected to be installed on physical boxes, virtual machines or cloud-hosted VMs. And while it doesn&#8217;t really matter to end-users where the software runs, containerizing the application means that it is far easier for businesses to scale their systems up or down as needed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134529" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134529" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2134529 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg" alt="Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enteprise-Manager-Kubernetes.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134529" class="wp-caption-text">Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Esri</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of customers &#8212; especially some of the larger customers &#8212; that run very complex questions,&#8221; Seaton explained. &#8220;And sometimes it&#8217;s unpredictable. They might be responding to seasonal events or business events or economic events, and they need to understand not only what&#8217;s going on in the world, but also respond to their many users from outside the organization coming in and asking questions of the systems that they put in place using ArcGIS. And that unpredictable demand is one of the key benefits of Kubernetes.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134535" style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134535" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2134535" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg" alt="Deploying Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes" width="339" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=130,150 130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=260,300 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=768,884 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=590,680 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134535" class="wp-caption-text">Deploying Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Esri</p></div></p>
<p>The team could have chosen to go the easy route and put a wrapper around its existing tools to containerize them and call it a day, but as Seaton noted, Esri used this opportunity to re-architect its tools and break it down into microservices.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken us a while because we took three or four big applications that together make up [ArcGIS] Enterprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we broke those apart into a much larger set of microservices. That allows us to containerize specific services and add a lot of high availability and resilience to the system without adding a lot of complexity for the administrators &#8212; in fact, we&#8217;re reducing the complexity as we do that and all of that gets installed in one single deployment script.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Kubernetes simplifies a lot of the management experience, a lot of companies that use ArcGIS aren&#8217;t yet familiar with it. And as Seaton and Heede noted, the company isn&#8217;t forcing anyone onto this platform. It will continue to support Windows and Linux just like before. Heede also stressed that it&#8217;s still unusual &#8212; especially in this industry &#8212; to see a complex, fully integrated system like ArcGIS being delivered in the form of microservices and multiple containers that its customers then run on their own infrastructure.</p>

<p>In addition to the Kubernetes announcement, Esri also today announced new JavaScript APIs that make it easier for developers to create applications that bring together Esri&#8217;s server-side technology and the scalability of doing much of the analysis on the client-side. Back in the day, Esri would support tools like Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex">Adobe/Apache Flex</a> for building rich web-based applications. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;re really focusing on a single web development technology and the toolset around that,&#8221; Esri product manager Julie Powell told me.</p>
<p>A bit later this month, Esri also plans to launch its new design system to make it easier and faster for developers to create clean and consistent user interfaces. This design system will launch April 22, but the company already provided a bit of a teaser today. As Powell noted, the challenge for Esri is that its design system has to help the company&#8217;s partners put their own style and branding on top of the maps and data they get from the ArcGIS ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is abuzz with the news that Topps, a company perhaps best known for making collectible trading cards, is <a href="https://www.mudrickcapitalacquisitioncorp.com/static-files/d04b0221-2195-4b87-b305-63b55bde4e61">going public via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>The reverse merger with its chosen blank-check company values the combination on an equity basis at $1.163 billion. That makes Topps some sort of unicorn. And because it has both e-commerce and digital angles, Topps is technically a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/is-a-tomato-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable"><del>fruit</del></a> tech company.</p>

<hr />
<p>Why do we care? We care because Topps and its products are popular with the same set of folks who are very excited about creating rare digital items on particular blockchains. Yes, the baseball card company is going public in a debut that could easily be read as a way to put money into the NFT craze without actually having to buy cryptocurrencies and go speculating itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And Topps apparently owns a number of assets in the candy space, which I find whimsical.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a small giggle as we go through the Topps deck and then ask if the company is being valued on its actual, and modestly attractive, present-day business or on possible revenues from future NFT-related activities.</p>
<h2>So, trading cards</h2>
<p>What is Topps? A mix of business units that it breaks down into four categories: Physical Sports and Entertainment (trading cards), Digital Sports and Entertainment (digital collectibles, apps and games), Gift Cards (gift cards for external brands) and Confections (candy).</p>
<p>In terms of scale, the company&#8217;s physical goods and confection businesses are by far its leading revenue drivers. Here&#8217;s the data:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134461" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134461" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2134461 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?w=680" alt="Chart showing Topps revenue" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png 934w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Topps investor presentation</p></div></p>
<p>First, observe that the company&#8217;s <em>pro forma adjusted EBITDA</em> nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020. That&#8217;s an aggressive expansion in hyperadjusted profitability. Note how much the company&#8217;s physical sports business grew from 2019 to 2020; a nearly 50% gain helped the company grow nicely last year.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook confirms it&#8217;s testing a new QR code feature and payment links for use with Facebook Pay to make it easier for people in the U.S. to send or request money from one another. The QR code feature, similar to Venmo&#8217;s QR codes and others, will allow a user to scan a friend&#8217;s code with their smartphone&#8217;s camera to send or request money, while the sharable payment links will let you publish your payment address outside of Facebook itself.</p>
<p>The addition was first spotted on Monday by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/facebook-pay-qr-code-payments/">MacRumors</a>, which noted that users were being presented with a new &#8220;Scan&#8221; button in the Facebook Pay carousel at the top of the screen. When you tap this button, you&#8217;re launched into an experience where you can scan the other person&#8217;s code. The screen that displays the QR code also introduces the personalized payment URL in the format of &#8220;https://m.me/pay/UserName,&#8221; which can also be sent to others when you&#8217;re making a payment or sending a request.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134505" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134505" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134505" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of FB Pay QR code (blurred for privacy)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the feature&#8217;s launch, but characterized it as a &#8220;test&#8221; that&#8217;s currently taking place in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make payments on Messenger even easier, we’ve begun testing the ability for people to use QR codes and payment links when they want to send or request money,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/574381195996811?helpref=uf_permalink">Only U.S. users</a> are able to send payments through Messenger at this time, they also noted.</p>
<p>Users who want to be able to send and receive money in Messenger have to be at least 18 years old, and will have to have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">Visa or Mastercard debit card</a>, a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775"> PayPal account</a> or one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">supported</a> prepaid cards or government-issued cards, in order to use the payments feature. They&#8217;ll also need to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/217942441564255/">set</a> their preferred currency to U.S. dollars in the app.</p>
<p>Facebook first launched its Facebook Pay service in November 2019, as a way to establish a single payment system that can extend across the company&#8217;s apps. However, the service as it stands today is not necessarily a rival to other apps like PayPal, because Facebook currently partners with PayPal as one of the supported payment methods.</p>
<p>Currently, Facebook Pay powers the payments experience across a number of areas in Facebook, which are focused on commerce, donations and tipping &#8212; like Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Shop, Buy on Instagram and for other activities &#8212; like buying Stars to support gaming Creators, buying tickets to live events, making donations to causes and more. Users can also send money to friends on Messenger through a built-in button.</p>
<p>For the time being, this payments experience is separate from Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/">cryptocurrency wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi,</a> though one could imagine that in time the two will become more integrated.</p>
<p>Facebook declined to share further details about the test, including how many or what percentage of users will see the new QR codes and links or when tests began and when they&#8217;ll end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it’s true the VC world has gone SPAC-happy, the reverse merger method hasn’t been a huge driver in robotics thus far, with some notable exceptions<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/"> like Berkshire-Grey</a>. This morning, however, Utah-based Sarcos Robotics <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406005563/en/Sarcos-Robotics-to-Merge-with-Rotor-Acquisition-Corp.">announced plans</a> to board the SPAC train, courtesy of Rotor Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>The deal could potentially value the robotic exoskeleton maker and blank check co. at a combined $1.3 billion, along with a potential $281 million earn-out. Sarcos is, of course, one of a number of companies currently exploring the robotic exoskeleton category. So, what sets the company apart, beyond some heavy-duty James Cameron-style design language?</p>
<p>Partnership are always a big motivator. Sarcos lined up a pretty big one way back at CES 2020. It was positioned at the center of Delta’s big tech push at the trade show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Delta’s employees are the key ingredient to our success, and we are committed to reducing on-the-job injuries as well as fostering workforce diversity and improving worker longevity for a healthier and safer team,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in today’s announcement. “My enthusiasm for Sarcos’ potential has only grown since then as we continue to work closely with Sarcos to turn our everyday heroes into superheroes, making their jobs safer and easier than ever.”</p>
<p>At the time, the airline announced that it would be partnering with the company to pilot these exoskeletons among its staff. The robotics-maker noted then that the tech can be used to lift 200-pound payloads for up to eight hours, without tiring the wearer. It’s in line with Sarcos’ more industrial-minded approach to wearable robotics.</p>

<p>Later that same year, the company announced a $40 million raise aimed at commercializing its Guardian XO unit. In today’s release, it adds that it expects to deliver the system at some point in the middle of next year, with the teleoperated Guardian XT arriving the following.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead data protection regulator in the European Union is seeking answers from the tech giant over a major data breach reported over the weekend.</p>
<p>The breach was reported by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">Business Insider</a> on Saturday, which said personal data (including email addresses and mobile phone numbers) of more than 500 million Facebook accounts had been posted to a low-level hacking forum &#8212; making the personal information on hundreds of millions of Facebook users&#8217; accounts freely available.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exposed data includes the personal information of over 533M Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32M records on users in the US, 11M on users in the UK, and 6M on users in India,&#8221; Business Insider said, noting that the dump includes phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios and some email addresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook responded to the report of the data dump by saying it related to a vulnerability in its platform it had &#8220;found and fixed&#8221; in August 2019 &#8212; dubbing the info &#8220;old data&#8221; which it also claimed had been reported in 2019. However as security experts were <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1378471695930040321">quick to point out</a>, most people don&#8217;t change their mobile phone number often &#8212; so Facebook&#8217;s trigger reaction to downplay the breach looks like an ill-thought-through attempt to deflect blame.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>It&#8217;s also not clear whether all the data is all &#8220;old&#8221;, as Facebook&#8217;s initial response suggests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of reasons for Facebook to try to downplay yet another data scandal. Not least because, under European Union data protection rules, there are stiff penalties for companies that fail to promptly report significant breaches to relevant authorities. And indeed for breaches themselves &#8212; as the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) bakes in an expectation of security by design and default.</p>
<p>By pushing the claim that the leaked data is &#8220;old&#8221; Facebook may be hoping to peddle the idea that it predates the GDPR coming into application (in May 2018).</p>
<p>However, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU, told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s not abundantly clear whether that&#8217;s the case at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period,&#8221; the DPC&#8217;s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;A significant number of the users are EU users. Much of the data appears to been data scraped some time ago from Facebook public profiles,&#8221; he also said.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>&#8220;Previous datasets were published in 2019 and 2018 relating to a large-scale scraping of the Facebook website which at the time Facebook advised occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 when Facebook closed off a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality. Because the scraping took place prior to GDPR, Facebook chose not to notify this as a personal data breach under GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doyle said the regulator sought to establish &#8220;the full facts&#8221; about the breach from Facebook over the weekend and is &#8220;continuing to do so&#8221; &#8212; making it clear that there&#8217;s an ongoing lack of clarity on the issue, despite the breach itself being claimed as &#8220;old&#8221; by Facebook.</p>
<p>The DPC also made it clear that it did not receive any proactive communication from Facebook on the issue &#8212; despite the GDPR putting the onus on companies to proactively inform regulators about significant data protection issues. Rather, the regulator had to approach Facebook &#8212; using a number of channels to try to obtain answers from the tech giant.</p>
<p>Through this approach the DPC said it learnt Facebook believes the information was scraped prior to the changes it made to its platform in 2018 and 2019 in light of vulnerabilities identified in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal.</p>
<p>A huge database of Facebook phone numbers was found unprotected online back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">September 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook had also earlier admitted to a vulnerability with a search tool it offered &#8212; revealing in <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/">April 2018</a> that somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion users had had their public Facebook information scraped via a feature which allowed people to look up users by inputting a phone number or email &#8212; which is one potential source for the cache of personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-sues-two-companies-engaged-in-data-scraping-operations/">Last year Facebook also filed a lawsuit</a> against two companies it accused of engaging in an international data scraping operation.</p>
<p>But the fallout from its poor security design choices continue to dog Facebook years after its &#8220;fix&#8221;.</p>
<p>More importantly, the fallout from the massive personal data spill continues to affect Facebook users whose information is now being openly offered for download on the internet &#8212; opening them up to the risk of spam and phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering (such as for attempted identity theft).</p>
<p>There are still more questions than answers about how this &#8220;old&#8221; cache of Facebook data came to be published online for free on a hacker forum.</p>
<p>The DPC said it was told by Facebook that &#8220;the data at issue appears to have been collated by third parties and potentially stems from multiple sources&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company also claimed the matter &#8220;requires extensive investigation to establish its provenance with a level of confidence sufficient to provide your Office and our users with additional information&#8221; &#8212; which is a long way of suggesting that Facebook has no idea either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook assures the DPC it is giving highest priority to providing firm answers to the DPC,&#8221; Doyle also said. &#8220;A percentage of the records released on the hacker website contain phone numbers and email address of users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Risks arise for users who may be spammed for marketing purposes but equally users need to be vigilant in relation to any services they use that require authentication using a person’s phone number or email address in case third parties are attempting to gain access.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC will communicate further facts as it receives information from Facebook,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment about the breach.</p>
<p>Facebook users who are concerned whether their information is in the dump can <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">run a search</a> for their phone number or email address via the data breach advice site, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-facebook-phone-numbers-are-now-searchable-in-have-i-been-pwned/">haveibeenpwned</a>.</p>
<p>According to haveibeenpwned&#8217;s Troy Hunt, this latest Facebook data dump contains far more mobile phone numbers than email addresses.</p>
<p>He writes that he was sent the data a few weeks ago &#8212; initially getting 370 million records and later &#8220;the larger corpus which is now in <em>very </em>broad circulation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it is the same, but a lot of it is also different,&#8221; Hunt also notes, adding: &#8220;There is not one clear source of this data.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year has put a spotlight on mental health, and startup Real is looking to shake up the space with a product that makes group therapy available on-demand.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Ariela Safira, <a href="https://www.join-real.com/">Real</a> is inspired by a longstanding methodology in the world of mental health: Group therapy. AA, for instance, has been around for decades and proven to be incredibly effective for some. But that format isn&#8217;t as readily available across a variety of issues beyond the disease of addiction.</p>
<p>To deploy this service, Real has raised $10 million in Series A financing, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from existing and new investors, including Megan Rapinoe and Minnesota Vikings Linebacker Eric Kendricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Real employs full-time therapists to lead group therapy across a variety of issues, including exploration of sexuality, anxiety, managing anger with family members and other real-world issues. With Real, users pay $28/month to have access to these pathways (as Real calls them), letting users watch these group therapy sessions on-demand and get journal prompts and other resources.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this platform is that users can get more tactical advice on these things, rather than trying to explore the problems. They also feel less alone, as they see others are struggling with the same things.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Real allows users to tap into the conversations and therapy they need at the time they want it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6VAVSr8KKK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/embed/#?secret=6VAVSr8KKK" data-secret="6VAVSr8KKK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Safira explained that she might be deep in her thoughts and feelings on Wednesday at 11pm, but can&#8217;t get a one-on-one therapy session until 2pm on Monday. Her state may have changed. With Real, she can get online and access the right pathway in the moment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Real&#8217;s research shows that most people doing one-on-one therapy said they went for general anxiety, relationship problems and career advice. However, on Real, the top pathways are sexuality, motherhood and intimacy. The conclusion is that the things people want to work on the most are not always the things they&#8217;re most comfortable digging into in a one-on-one setting.</p>
<p>By scaling group therapy sessions to an on-demand audience, Real has been able to bring the cost of this type of service way down, especially when compared to one-on-one therapy.</p>
<p>Real is the product of many years of work in the mental health space. While she was studying for her undergrad degree at Stanford, Safira&#8217;s friend attempted suicide. It was her first time confronting the mental health system and it made her wonder why the system was designed the way it was. She threw herself in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent two to three years working on how to redesign the mental health care system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That entails visiting and flying to rehab centers, therapy offices, architecture firms that have built those spaces to learn why we make the decisions in mental health care that we make. Things like is there research behind the bright white walls in inpatient mental health facilities, and if not, is that based on legal hurdles or financial hurdles? I really wanted to get into the foundation of how to build a system.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134482" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134482" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134482" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?w=345" alt="" width="345" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png 791w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=152,300 152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=768,1512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=345,680 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=780,1536 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Phone-Real-Talk.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134482" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Real</p></div></p>
<p>She dropped out of Stanford, then returned to Stanford, then went to Columbia for her masters, and then dropped out of Columbia to start Real. And the time seems to finally be right. Real has attracted investment from big names in institutional VC and big names in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Ariela] looked at something that has been around for so long, therapies in the traditional sense, and flipped it on its head to break up the status quo, and I thought that was really interesting and innovative,&#8221; said Megan Rapinoe in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;There are obviously a lot of barriers to access mental health services, for a lot of different reasons. Hopefully, this platform can make it easier for people to get the help that they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapinoe is but one of the big names invested in Real. She is joined by Gwyneth Paltrow and Eric Kendricks.</p>
<p>Kendricks explained that he had never been averse to therapy but that he learned a lot after meeting his now-fiancé and hearing about her struggles and the struggles of her family, which has dealt with a variety of mental health issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything was going well for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was always playing well in the field, and financially, I&#8217;m making more money than when I was a kid. But I did have moments where I was questioning myself and in my head a lot and it&#8217;s kind of a weird feeling. I had to take a step back and I realized that I was going through a little bit of something. But based on the conversations I had with my fiancé, I used my resources to find the help that I needed and it was amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained that the shift in society&#8217;s mentality around mental health has paved the way for a product like Real, which is a more proactive and preventative approach to mental wellness.</p>
<p>But Real has also been able to react quickly to big events in our world. The company has launched a product called <a href="https://www.realtothepeople.com/">Real to the People</a>, which offers free access to the platform during moments of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and, most recently, the spike in anti-Asian hate crimes.</p>
<p>Nicole Quinn, partner at Lightspeed, explained that the firm has had an interest in the mental health space for a long time. In fact, LSVP is an investor in Calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;aha&#8217; moment for me was when I looked at the disease of alcoholism,&#8221; said Quinn, who led the round in Calm. &#8220;You get to go to Alcoholics Anonymous, and you really benefit through having groups. Can we apply that same group method by scaling to other areas. We have a fundamental belief that yes, you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real has raised a total of $16 million since launch.</p>
