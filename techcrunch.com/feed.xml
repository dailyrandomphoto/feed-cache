										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The Crown,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> lavish historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, has returned for a fourth season that focuses on Elizabeth&#8217;s relationship with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and on Prince Charles&#8217; troubled marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/07/original-content-crown-season-3/">conflicting opinions</a> about the show&#8217;s past seasons, and the new season hasn&#8217;t exactly settled those disagreements, as we explain on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Anthony and (especially) Jordan remain fans of the show, and they found season four to be particularly compelling. Yes, the monarchy is a little ridiculous and &#8220;The Crown&#8221; does have a tendency to simplify real-world events, but its retelling of the Charles-Diana relationship is heartbreaking, and it also takes the time to show some of the damage wrought by Thatcher&#8217;s policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Darrell, on the other hand, remains a skeptic, with little patience for all the attention paid to the royal family. He was particularly exasperated by the show&#8217;s deviation from historical reality, and by performances (particularly Gillian Anderson as Thatcher) that felt more like cheesy, &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;-style imitations.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing the show, we also discuss this week&#8217;s announcement that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max/">&#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; will be premiering in both theaters and on HBO Max</a> on December 25.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karan Bajaj, an Indian entrepreneur who teaches meditation and in his recent book invites others to live a life away from the noise, is going after the most vocal critic of his startup.</p>
<p>Bajaj, founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">coding platform WhiteHat Jr</a>, has filed a defamation case against Pradeep Poonia, an engineer who has publicly criticized the firm for its marketing tactics, the quality of the courses on the platform, and aggressive takedowns of such feedback.</p>
<p>Most of the customers of WhiteHat Jr, which is aimed at kids, live in America, and demand for its one-to-one classes have surged nearly 90% this year, according to the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/485381422/Karan-Bajaj-Anr-vs-Pradeep-Poonia">the lawsuit</a> &#8212; in which Bajaj (pictured left above) is seeking $2.6 million in damages &#8212; Poonia has been accused of infringing trademarks and copyright of properties owned by WhiteHat Jr, defaming and spreading misleading information about the startup and its founder, and accessing the company&#8217;s private communications app.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also accuses Poonia of publicly sharing phone numbers of WhiteHat Jr employees and making strong accusations such as likening the startup&#8217;s marketing tactics to &#8220;child sexual abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyers further claim that Poonia recorded sessions of some classes conducted by WhiteHat Jr, asked questions that were not relevant to the course with the &#8220;humiliate and harass&#8221; the teachers and then posted them online.</p>
<p>&#8220;As some of the one-on-one communications between the Plaintiffs’ teachers and the Defendant have demonstrated, the former have felt extremely threatened and harassed by the Defendant which is even more pertinent given that the Plaintiffs’ entire workforce of 11,000 teachers is female,&#8221; the suit says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Defendant’s activities have critically affected the Plaintiffs’ business and resulted in loss of its goodwill and reputation, and the confidence of its customers in its business. It is submitted that as a consequence of the Defendant’s tweets, Plaintiffs have suffered a steep dip in the conversion rate from trial classes to actual registrations which has severely affected revenue its revenue.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BslZLk1hwG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">India&#8217;s Byju&#8217;s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s Byju&#8217;s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/embed/#?secret=BslZLk1hwG" data-secret="BslZLk1hwG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the lawsuit, riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, appears to be also indicative of just how little criticism WhiteHat Jr, owned by India&#8217;s second most valuable startup Byju&#8217;s, is willing to accept.</p>
<p>According to internal posts of a Slack channel of WhiteHat Jr shared by Poonia, the startup has aggressively used copyright protection to take down numerous unflattering feedback about the startup in recent months.</p>
<p>The suit also raises concern with Poonia accusing WhiteHat Jr of &#8220;murdering&#8221; an imaginary kid that featured in one of its earlier ads.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old child named &#8220;Wolf Gupta&#8221; appeared in earlier ads of WhiteHat Jr, which claimed that the kid had landed a lucrative job at Google. The kid does not exist, the lawyers of Bajaj say in the suit. Ironically that was also the argument Poonia, who spent a long time trying to unearth more information about this supposed poster child of WhiteHat Jr, was making in his tweets.</p>

<p>Scores of education startups in India have reported skyrocketing growth in recent months as schools remain shut across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Byju&#8217;s is the most valuable edtech startup in the world with a roster of marquee backers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/">including Mary Meeker</a>&#8216;s Bond.</p>
<p>Even as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Facebook, which has amassed over 400 million users in India and makes little in the country — the education category is an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello everyone and welcome back to Week in Review! Natasha here, subbing in for Lucas while he’s out. This week, we’ll talk about loneliness raising money and how Zoom fatigue is fueling innovation.</p>
<p>For everyone celebrating, happy holidays! Keep on the lookout next week for more festive content, including the launch of our annual TechCrunch Gift Guides.</p>

<h2><strong>The big story</strong></h2>
<p>Over the last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/?tpcc=ECTW2020">I spent time working out of virtual HQs</a>. Dozens of founders are using spatial technology and gamification to create online worlds. Consumers are invited to congregate and create some of the spontaneity of in-person events, such as the work day or weddings. Founders are testing if the metaverse can be brought into the mainstream. After tossing a few succulents around myself, I was impressed (especially as a non-gamer) over how intuitive the platform felt. It feels special to bump into someone in 2020.</p>
<p>You can read more of my story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/?tpcc=ECTW2020">here</a>, which includes a demo video and pictures to give you a feel for the space. For today, though, I want to talk about what I think the rise of virtual HQs is not-so-subtly telling us.</p>
<p>Founders are trying to disrupt loneliness in this chapter of the coronavirus pandemic. There’s a shift in what the technology at its core is trying to fix, and it’s a little dynamic called Zoom fatigue.</p>
<p>For example, in March, we saw startups race to try to bring remote work to the masses. Now, in November, we’re seeing startups race to fix the broken, fatigued world of remote work.</p>
<p>The issue here, I think, is that founders are trying to innovate a solution to a lack of spontaneity and togetherness in our lives. Spontaneity, by definition, cannot be forced. And the community will always feel different in person. These inherent clashes make us, or at least me, question what technology’s constraints are. That said, virtual event platform Hopin and its <a href="ents-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">$2 billion valuation</a> shuts me right up.</p>
<p>Still, as we see startups chase to fix the next big pain point that everyone can agree on, it will be important to track what’s a venture-backable problem, and what’s a more existential one.</p>

<h2>The round up</h2>
<p><strong>A White House in transition </strong></p>
<p>It’s been a busy week for a shifting White House and big tech. President Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/">fired U.S. cybersecurity official Chris Krebs</a> for debunking false election claims. Meanwhile, two platforms that have fed fires of misinformation, Facebook and Twitter, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-and-facebooks-senate-judiciary-hearing-philosophies/">yet another testimony</a> in front of Congress. Big tech will likely continue to face backlash when the Biden Administration takes lead, especially when it comes to antitrust regulation. However, it’s not all bad news for tech: President-elect Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan and tech-friendly transition team could help out startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">More here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The race for a COVID-19 vaccine</strong></p>
<p>This week, Pfizer and BioNTech sought emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its COVID-19 vaccine, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">which is 95% effective.</a> The news follows Moderna’s report that its vaccine is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/moderna-reports-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-94-5-effective-in-first-data-from-phase-3-trial/ "> 94.5% effective</a>. While proposed approval could get vaccines in the hands of high-risk populations, wide-spread vaccines likely won’t be available until 2021. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">Keep reading here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Apple’s latest Intel</strong></p>
<p>As my colleague Brian Heater puts it, “every refresh can’t be a revolution” in hardware product updates. That said, Apple’s latest trio of Macs has impressed. We have reviews on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/the-new-mac-mini-the-revival-of-the-no-compromise-low-cost-mac/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/macbook-air-m1-review-the-right-apple-silicon-mac-for-most/">Macbook Air</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">MacBook Pro</a>. Notably, the line is powered by Mac’s in-house microchips, pushing an effort that has been in the works since 2008. It’s a win for Apple, and loss for Intel, which had until now been powering Macs. Still, Intel seems to be taking its break-up with Apple alright, since announcing its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/after-apples-m1-launch-intel-announces-its-own-white-label-laptop/">white-label laptop</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest social media site to allow users to experiment with posting disappearing content. Fleets, as Twitter calls them, allows its mobile users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">post short stories</a>, like photos or videos with overlaying text, that are set to vanish after 24 hours.</p>
<p>But a bug meant that fleets weren&#8217;t deleting properly and could still be accessed long after 24 hours had expired. Details of the bug were posted in a series of tweets on Saturday, less than a week after the feature launched.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">full disclosure: scraping fleets from public accounts without triggering the read notification</p>
<p>the endpoint is: <a href="https://t.co/332FH7TEmN">https://t.co/332FH7TEmN</a></p>
<p>&mdash; cathode gay tube (@donk_enby) <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1329935540049817600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The bug effectively allowed anyone to access and download a user&#8217;s fleets without triggering a notification that the user&#8217;s fleet had been read and by whom. The implication is that this bug could be abused to archive a user&#8217;s fleets after they expire.</p>
<p>Using an app that&#8217;s designed to interact with Twitter&#8217;s back-end systems via its developer API. What returned was a list of fleets from the server. Each fleet had its own direct URL, which when opened in a browser would load the fleet as an image or a video. But even after the 24 hours elapsed, the server would still return links to fleets that had already disappeared from view in the Twitter app.</p>
<p>When reached, a Twitter spokesperson said a fix was on the way. &#8220;We&#8217;re aware of a bug accessible through a technical workaround where some Fleets media URLs may be accessible after 24 hours. We are working on a fix that should be rolled out shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter acknowledged that the fix means that fleets should now expire properly, it said it won&#8217;t delete the fleet from its servers for up to 30 days — and that it may hold onto fleets for longer if they violate its rules. We checked that we could still load fleets from their direct URLs even after they expire.</p>
<p>Fleet with caution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>This is The TechCrunch Exchange, a newsletter that goes out on Saturdays, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">based on the column of the same name</a>. You can sign up for the email <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a neat look into the world of mental health startup fundraising planned for this week, but after being slow-motion carpet-bombed by S-1s, that is now shoved off to Monday and we have to pause and talk about COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has been the most animating force for startups and venture capital in 2020, discounting the slow movement of global business into the digital realm. But COVID did more than that, as we all know. It crashed some companies as assuredly as it gave others a boost. For every </span><b>Peloton</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is probably a </span><b>Toast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in other words.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the case with this week’s crop of unicorn IPO candidates, though they are unsurprisingly weighted far more toward the COVID-accelerated cohort of startups instead of the group of startups that the pandemic cut off at the knees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More simply, COVID-19 gave most of our recent IPOs a polite shove in the back, helping them jog a bit faster toward the public-offering finish line. Let’s talk about it.</span></p>
<p><b>Roblox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the gaming company that targets kids, has been a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/what-is-roblox-worth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beneficiary during the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as folks stayed home and, it appears, gave their kids money to buy in-game currency so that their parents could have some peace. Great business, even if Roblox warned that growth could slow sharply next year, when compared to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its epic 2020 gains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Roblox is hardly the only company taking advantage of COVID-19’s impacts on the market to get public while their numbers are stellar. We saw </span><b>DoorDash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file last week, crowing from atop a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mountain of revenue growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that came in part from you and I trying to stay home since March. As it turns out you order more delivery when you can’t leave your house.</span></p>
<p><b>Affirm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got a COVID-19 boost as well, with not only e-commerce spend growing &#8212; Affirm provides point-of-sale loans to consumers during online shopping &#8212; but also because Peloton took off, and lots of folks chose to finance their new exercise bike with the payment service. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/inside-affirms-ipo-filing-a-look-at-its-economics-profits-and-revenue-concentration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call it a double-boost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IPO is well-timed. </span><b>Wish</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/wish-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">falls into the same bucket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though it did hit some supply-chain and delivery issues due to the pandemic, so you could argue it either way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, as we have seen from global numbers, COVID-19 is very much not done wreaking havoc on our health, happiness, and ability to go about normal life. So the trends that this week’s S-1s have shown us still have some room to run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is irksome for </span><b>Airbnb</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a unicorn that was supposed to have debuted already via a direct listing, but instead had to hit pause, borrow money, lay off staff, and now </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/airbnb-files-to-go-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jog to the startup finish line with less revenue in this Q3 than the last</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In time, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/5-questions-from-airbnbs-ipo-filing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb will get back to full-speed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but among our new IPO candidates it’s the only company net-harmed by COVID-19. That makes it special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other trends to keep tabs on, regarding the pandemic. Not every software company that you might expect to be thriving at the moment actually is; </span><b>Workday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares are off 8% today as I write to you, because the company said that COVID-19 is harming its ability to land new customers. Here’s </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390527-workday-inc-wday-ceo-aneel-bhusri-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its CFO Robynne Sisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its earnings call</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind, however, that while we have seen some recent stability in the underlying environment, headwinds due to COVID remains particularly to net new bookings. And given our subscription model, these headwinds that have impacted us all year will be more fully evident in next year’s subscription revenue weighing on our growth in the near-term.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeesh. So don’t look at recent IPOs and think that all things are good for all companies, or even all software companies. (To be clear, the pandemic is a human crisis, but my job is to talk about its business impacts so here we are. Hugs, and please stay as safe as you can.)</span></p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was so much news this week that we have to be annoyingly summary. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught up with </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/"><b>Brex</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/hdubugras?lang=en"><b>Henrique Dubugras</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other day, giving The Exchange a chance to parse what happened to the company during the early COVID days when the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/brex-the-credit-card-for-startups-cuts-staff-amid-restructuring"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided to cut staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The short answer from the CEO is that the company went from growing 10% to 15% each month, to seeing negative growth &#8212; not a sin, Airbnb saw negative gross bookings for a few months earlier this year &#8212; and as the company had hired for a big year, it had to make cuts. Dubugras talked about how hard of a choice that was to make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex’s business rebounded faster than the company expected, however, driven in part by strong new business formation &#8212; </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some data here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; and companies rapidly moving into the digital realm and moving to finance systems like Brex’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, Dubugras wants to expand the pool of companies that Brex can underwrite, which makes sense as that would open up its market size quite a lot. And the company is as remote as companies are now, with its CEO opening up during our chat about the pros and cons of the move. Happily for the business fintech unicorn, Dubugras said that some of the negatives of companies working more remotely haven’t been as tough as expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up: Growth metric. </span><a href="https://verbit.ai/"><b>Verbit</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that uses AI to transcribe and caption videos, raised a $60 million Series C this week led by </span><b>Sapphire Ventures</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I couldn’t get to the round, but the company did note in its release that it has seen 400% year-over-year revenue growth, and that its “revenue run-rate [has] grown five-fold since 2019.” Nice.</span></p>
<p><b>Jai Das</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the round for Verbit, and, in a quirk of good timing, I’m hosting an Extra Crunch Live with him in a few weeks. (Extra Crunch sub required for that, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><span style="font-weight: 400;">head here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need one. The discount code ‘EQUITY’ should still be working if it helps.)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.telos.com/"><b>Telos</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Virginia-based cybersecurity and identity company went public this week. It fell under our radar because there is more news than we have hands to type it up. Such is the rapid-fire news cycle of late 2020. But, to catch us both up, Telos priced midrange but with an upsized offering, valuing it around $1 billion, </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/telos-upsized-ipo-prices-in-the-middle-of-the-expected-range-to-value-the-company-at-just-over-1-billion-2020-11-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to MarketWatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After going public, Telos shares </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/telos-shares-surge-in-trading-debut-as-ipos-return-51605819349"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have performed well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cybersecurity is having one hell of a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning back to our favorite topic in the world, SaaS, </span><a href="https://www.profitwell.com/"><b>ProfitWell’s</b></a><b> Patrick Campbell</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1327248835241005057"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped a grip of data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the impact of COVID-19 on the B2B SaaS market. Mostly it’s positive. There was a hit early on, but then growth seems to have accelerated. Just keep in mind the Workday example from earlier; not everyone is in software growth paradise as 2020 comes to a close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, finally, after Affirm released its S-1 filing, competing service </span><b>Klarna</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided it was a good time to </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/klarna-reaches-a-record-11-million-customers-in-the-us-301177287.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop some performance data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its own. First of all, Klarna &#8212; thanks. We like data. Second of all, just go public. Klarna said that it grew from 10 million customers in the United States to 11 million in three weeks, and that the second statistic was up 106% compared to its year-ago tally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm, you are now required by honor to update your S-1 with even more data as an arch-nerd clapback. Sorry, I don’t make the rules.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to Human Capital, where I break down the latest in diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor in tech.</span></p>
<p><b>TL;DR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Apple announced its third head of diversity and inclusion in four years, Uber’s Black employee base shrunk despite the company committing to anti-racism and Reddit brought on its second Black board member this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Facebook’s content moderators spoke out against the company for forcing some of them to work in the office during a pandemic and a new report from Silicon Valley Rising showed 63% of blue-collar tech workers are Black or Latinx. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here to get this as a newsletter in your inbox every Fridays at 1 p.m. PT. However, I’m taking next week off so you won’t be hearing from me until December 4.</span></p>
<p><b>Facebook content moderators demand better protections and benefits</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of more than 200 Facebook  content moderators, as well as some full-time employees, demanded the tech company “stop needlessly risking moderators’ lives,”</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-content-moderators-demand-safer-working-conditions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they wrote in an open letter to Facebook and the company’s contractors that manage content moderators, Accenture and Covalen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The demands came after </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/20/facebook-coronavuris-content-moderator-accenture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Intercept reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how some Facebook content moderators — who deal with things like sexual abuse and graphic violence — were required to come back into the office during the pandemic. Shortly after they returned to the office, a Facebook content moderator reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook later defended its decision to bring some content moderators into the office, saying it’s &#8220;not able to route some of the most sensitive and graphic content to outsourced reviewers at home,&#8221;</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/facebook-defends-choice-to-bring-moderators-to-offices-during-pandemic.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its VP of Integrity Guy Rosen said on a press call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;This is really sensitive content. This is not something you want people reviewing from home with their family around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Turo commits $1 million to addressing wealth inequality</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car-sharing marketplace </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/turo-puts-1-million-toward-helping-black-people-make-money-sharing-cars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turo teamed up with Kiva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer interest-free loans to Black people and folks from traditionally underserved communities to buy cars and then share them on Turo. The $1 million commitment aims to address the issue of wealth inequality in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the Turo Seed Initiative, those who are eligible can raise up to $15,000 via crowdfunding and Turo’s matching program. In order to raise money on Kiva, folks must use the funding for business purposes, which includes car sharing on Turo. Through Kiva, they can raise up to $7,500 and Turo will then match up to $7,500. From there, they can buy a car and list it on Turo.</span></p>
<p><b>Tech’s cafeteria workers, security officers, etc. are predominantly Black or Latinx</b></p>
<p><a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20403224-serving-silicon-valley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Silicon Valley Rising report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently showed about 63% of blue-collar tech workers are Black or Latinx. These are the workers who cook and serve food in tech company cafeterias, drive tech shuttles or work as security officers or custodians.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vn9w/blue-collar-unions-fear-widespread-layoffs-in-silicon-valley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of cafeteria workers who formerly worked inside Verizon Media’s offices protested outside its CEO’s home in San Francisco. These workers were laid off by Verizon Media contractor Compass in September. Meanwhile, LinkedIn</span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/06/30/linkedin-cuts-261-cafeteria-workers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stopped paying more than 260 food service workers at the end of June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Tesla </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7kzgqz/teslas-laid-off-janitors-and-bus-drivers-say-they-cant-afford-food-and-medication"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laid off 280 janitors and bus drivers in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Transitioning from Trump to Biden: Now is not the time for complacency </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dei-work-needs-a-structural-response-to-a-systemic-issue/id1317432118?i=1000499488014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this week’s episode of TC Mixtape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we spoke with </span><a href="mailto:yvonne@thereadyset.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y-Vonne Hutchinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Ready Set about DEI and what a new administration means for the work she and so many others are doing. Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I’m optimistic and so thrilled at the prospect that we’re not going to see harm like we did under the Trump administration, I also remember the Obama administration. This isn’t like these structures that got spun up &#8212; this didn’t happen out of the blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that we have learned some really valuable lessons when it comes to the impact that not just like lack of diversity inclusion, because that feels so milk toast to say, but like these exclusionary and harmful organizations, platforms, powerful people in our industry, like I hope we&#8217;ve learned from our mistakes there. But I think that there&#8217;s always going to be a temptation to say, ‘well, we got Trump out and the work is done’ [or] feel a little bit complacent. I worry about that complacency. Because, you know, the dirty, nasty undercurrents, all of that stuff that got us to where we are today &#8212; all of that’s still there, all that festering toxicity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still have work to do, and I&#8217;m not saying that everybody&#8217;s a bad actor and you know, get rid of it. But I think that we really need to be critical and think about what accountability looks like for our industry and make sure that we&#8217;re not falling into the same bad habits that we did that got us here in the first place. So I’m kind of waiting to see how that plays out.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><b>Apple announces a new head of D&amp;I </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple recently announced Barbara Whye, former head of D&amp;I at Intel, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/19/apple-hires-barbara-whye-intel-diversity-head-2021-exclusive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be joining them as its VP of inclusion and diversity in early 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The announcement came after its former head of D&amp;I, Christie Smith, left the company in June “to spend time with her family,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/16/apple-christie-smith-diversity-racism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an Apple spokesperson said at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smith had been in the role since late 2017, after Denise Young Smith, the company’s first-ever VP of diversity and inclusion, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/16/apple-vp-of-diversity-and-inclusion-denise-young-smith-is-leaving/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">left after only being in the role for six months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Uber’s D&amp;I efforts fall short this year</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber recently released its latest diversity report, showing a decline in the overall representation of Black employees in the U.S. despite an increased focus on racial justice this year in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. In 2019, Uber was 9.3% Black while this year, only 7.5% of its employees are Black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber attributes the decline in Black employees to its</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/more-uber-layoffs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">layoffs earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where about 40% of its employees in community operations were laid off, Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a company that has so publicly stated its stance on anti-racism, that&#8217;s not acceptable,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That unintentional decline in the Black population at Uber &#8220;led to a lot of soul searching,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Dara was certainly upset by it. Every leader was. It reinforced how easy it is to lose some ground after all the work you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Reddit adds another Black director to the board</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit has appointed Paula Price, who has served on the board of six public companies, including Accenture and Deutsche Bank, to its board of directors. Price&#8217;s appointment makes her one of two Black directors on the company&#8217;s board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Paula’s vast experience as a world-class financial leader and strategic advisor will be a tremendous asset to us in the years ahead,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. &#8220;Best of all, she embodies the two qualities most important to us for this Board seat: expertise leading companies through periods of transformative growth and real passion for Reddit’s mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian stepped down from the board and urged the company to appoint a Black director to take his place, Reddit had zero Black board members. Reddit took Ohanian&#8217;s advice and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/reddit-names-ycs-michael-seibel-to-board-following-co-founder-alexis-ohanians-exit/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed Y Combinator Michael Seibel to the board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>LAPD bans commercial facial recognition</b></p>

That’s not to say LAPD won’t continue using facial recognition that compares images to suspect booking records but it will no longer use facial recognition tools that rely on social media and other websites. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[For some of the most awaited Silicon Valley tech companies of the decade, this week looked good enough to file for IPOs]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Editor’s note:<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bilal-zuberi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="bilal-zuberi"> </a></strong><em>Get this free weekly recap of TechCrunch news that any startup can use by email every Saturday morning (7 a.m. PT). <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters?_ga=2.28241148.139228165.1581112174-1679447956.1560885729">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The wait was long but this week the time was right: Airbnb finally filed its S-1 and so did Affirm, C3.ai, Roblox, and Wish. We are likely to see these five price on public markets before the end of an already superlative year for tech IPOs. The ongoing pandemic and political turmoil were not scary enough, apparently.</p>
<p>This coming decade, you have to think that we&#8217;ll see a more even spread of tech companies going public. Many of the companies above have been bottled up for years behind privately funded growth strategies. Today, however, the industry has a better grasp of SPACs and direct listings, and various funding routes. Companies have more options from their founding for how they might grow and exit one day. Public investors in 2020 also seem to have a deeper appreciation for the current revenue numbers and future growth opportunities for tech companies. Why, I can still remember all the geniuses who bragged about shorting the Facebook IPO not so long ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Will we see a more even spread of where IPOs come from? While all of this week&#8217;s filers are headquartered in San Francisco or environs, that now feels almost like a coincidental reference to the years when these companies were founded. More states have been minting their own unicorns, with Ohio-based Root Insurance recently going public and Utah-based Qualtrics heading (back) that way. Tech startups are now global, meanwhile, and plenty of countries are working to keep their unicorns closer to home than New York.</p>

<h2>What does a Biden administration mean for tech?</h2>
<p>What does Joe Biden intend as president around technology policy? On the one hand, tech companies might not be returning to the White House too fast. &#8220;All told, we’re seeing some familiar names in the mix, but 2020 isn’t 2008,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">Taylor Hatmaker explains</a> about potential presidential appointments from the industry. &#8220;Tech companies that emerged as golden children over the last 10 years are radioactive now. Regulation looms on the horizon in every direction. Whatever policy priorities emerge out of the Biden administration, Obama’s technocratic gilded age is over and we’re in for something new.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">However, tech industries and companies focused on shared goals might find support. In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">review of Biden&#8217;s climate-change policies</a>, Jon Shieber looks at major green infrastructure plans that could be on the way.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Any policies that a Biden administration enacts would have to focus on economic opportunity broadly, and much of the proposed plan from the campaign fulfills that need. One of its key propositions was that it would be “creating good, union, middle-class jobs in communities left behind, righting wrongs in communities that bear the brunt of pollution, and lifting up the best ideas from across our great nation — rural, urban and tribal,” according to the transition website. An early emphasis on grid and utility infrastructure could create significant opportunities for job creation across America — and be a boost for technology companies. “Our electric power infrastructure is old, aging and not secure,” said Abe Yokell, co-founder of the energy and climate-focused venture capital firm Congruent Ventures. “From an infrastructure standpoint, transmission distribution really should be upgraded and has been underinvested over the years. And it is in direct alignment with providing renewable energy deployment across the U.S. and the electrification of everything.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>The future of construction tech</h2>
<p>A skilled labor shortage is piling on top of the construction industry&#8217;s traditional challenges this year. The result is that tech adoption is getting a big push into the real world, Allison Xu of Bain Capital Ventures writes in a guest column for Extra Crunch this week. She maps out six main <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/">construction categories where tech startups</a> are emerging, including project conception, design and engineering, pre-construction, construction execution, post construction and construction management. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the article about that last item:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works today: </strong>Construction management and operations teams manage the end-to-end project, with functions such as document management, data and insights, accounting, financing, HR/payroll, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Key challenges:</strong> The complexity of the job site translates to highly complex and burdensome paperwork associated with each project. Managing the process requires communication and alignment across many stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>How technology can address challenges: </strong>The nuances of the multistakeholder construction process merit value in a verticalized approach to managing the project. Construction management tools like <a href="https://www.procore.com/">Procore</a>, <a href="https://www.hyphensolutions.com/info/">Hyphen Solutions</a> and <a href="https://ingeniousio.com/">IngeniousIO</a> have created ways for contractors to coordinate and track the end-to-end process more seamlessly. Other players like <a href="https://www.levelset.com/">Levelset</a> have taken a construction-specific approach to functions like invoice management and payments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Virtual HQs after the pandemic?</h2>
<p>Pandemic-era work solutions like online team meeting spaces are heading towards a less certain, vaccine-based reality. Have we all gone remote-first enough that they will have a real market, still? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">Natasha Mascarenhas checks in</a> with some of the top companies to see how it&#8217;s looking, here&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the goal of making remote work more spontaneous, there are dozens of new startups working to create virtual HQs for distributed teams. The three that have risen to the top include <a href="https://branch.gg/">Branch</a>, built by Gen Z gamers; <a href="https://gather.town/about">Gather</a>, created by engineers building a gamified Zoom; and <a href="https://www.huddlehq.io/">Huddle</a>, which is still in stealth.</p>
<p>The platforms are all racing to prove that the world is ready to be a part of virtual workspaces. By drawing on multiplayer gaming culture, the startups are using spatial technology, animations and productivity tools to create a metaverse dedicated to work.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge ahead? The startups need to convince venture capitalists and users alike that they’re more than Sims for Enterprise or an always-on Zoom call. The potential success could signal how the future of work will blend gaming and socialization for distributed teams.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast (<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</em></p>
<p><em>This week wound up being incredibly busy. What else, with a week that included both the Airbnb and Affirm IPO filings, a host of mega-rounds for new unicorns, some fascinating smaller funding events and some new funds?</em></p>
<p><em>So we had a lot to get through, but with <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">your humble servant</a>, we dove in headfirst:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Affirm has filed to go public! The fintech unicorn is big, growing and losing less money over time. We were pretty impressed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/affirm-files-to-go-public/">in our first look</a>. Then, with a bit more time, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/inside-affirms-ipo-filing-a-look-at-its-economics-profits-and-revenue-concentration/">dug deeper</a> and found a weakness or two. Still, Affirm is heading public and not in poor shape.</em></li>
<li><em>Airbnb filed, and we jumped into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/airbnb-ipo-s-1-equity/">an Equity Shot</a> as fast as we could on Tuesday to get our minds around the news. Since then, Danny dug <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/the-vc-and-founder-winners-in-airbnbs-ipo/">through the venture capital winners circle</a> — a surprisingly small subset of firms! — and we also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/5-questions-from-airbnbs-ipo-filing/">got into some questions that I had about the company’s finances</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>Robinhood is said to have an IPO in the books, so we talked a bit about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">what we know concerning its Q3 growth</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>And then there was edtech, as always. This week we talked about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/tencent-is-said-to-invest-in-online-education-startup-udemy">Tencent backing Udemy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">Duolingo raising again</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/transfr-raises-12m-series-a-to-bring-virtual-reality-to-manufacturing-plant-floors/">Transfr</a> picking up a Series A that we thought was super interesting.</em></li>
<li><em>Danny wanted to talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trust-will-raises-15m-as-digital-estate-planning-hits-mainstream/">the Trust &amp; Will Series A</a>. We tried to not make that many jokes.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/zenbusiness-series-b/">ZenBusiness raised $55 million as well</a>, in an outsized Series B.</em></li>
<li><em>Financial Venture Studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/pre-seed-fintech-firm-financial-venture-studio-closes-on-debut-fund-to-build-on-legacy-of-top-investments/">put together a new fund</a> to cut small checks into seed-stage fintech startups. We think that’s great. Especially given what we know about what is going on in the fintech venture world.</em></li>
<li><em>And Natasha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">walked us through her latest deep-dive</a>, a look into the world of virtual headquarters. This led to the worst joke of the show.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>What a week! Three episodes, some new records, and a very tired us after all the action. More on Monday!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the first major streaming platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/">offer a social watching experience</a>. And with most major league sports now being allowed to resume behind closed doors, Hulu’s combined proposition with ESPN will likely help entertain the service&#8217;s <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/disney-plus-reaches-26-5-million-subscribers-1203492187/">30+ million users</a> over the winter months.</p>
<p>But users have a surplus in choice of streaming services right now, so how will Hulu stay competitive?</p>
<p>With the help of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ux" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ux">UX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> expert <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-ramsey" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="peter-ramsey">Peter Ramsey <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from <a href="https://builtformars.com/">Built for Mars</a>, we’re going to give Hulu an Extra Crunch UX teardown, demonstrating five ways it could improve its overall user experience. These include easy product comparisons, consistent widths, proportionate progress bars and other suggestions.</p>
<h2>Comparing features inside packages</h2>
<p>If your product/service has different tiers/versions, ensure that the differences between these options are obvious and easy to compare.</p>
<p>The fail: Hulu has four different packages, but the listed features are inconsistent between options, making it incredibly difficult to compare. Instead of using bullet points, they’ve buried the benefits within paragraphs.</p>
<p>The fix: Break the paragraphs down into bullet points. Then, make sure that the bullet points are worded consistently between options.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2073388" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg 2864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=1536,959 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=2048,1279 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Comparing—TC.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear: I&#8217;m really surprised this one got past the marketing department. Not a lot to say except that I would argue that when UX, including layout and copywriting decisions, become decoupled from business goals and customer wants, a company is in trouble. Would you agree that&#8217;s what has happened here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter Ramsey:</strong> Honestly, this happens all the time. I think it’s just a symptom of the designers building things that look nice, not things that work nicely. I probably raise this issue on about one-third of the private audits I do — it’s that common.</p>
<h2>Keep a consistent width</h2>
<p>Try to maintain a consistent page width throughout a single journey — unless there’s a major benefit to changing the width.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2073386 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="263" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?resize=300,116 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?resize=768,297 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?resize=680,263 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hulu—Width—TC.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The fail: During the Hulu sign-up process, the page width doubles at a totally unnecessary point. This is disorienting for the user, with no obvious rationale.</p>
<p>The fix: Hulu has a pretty consistent first-half of their journey and then it drops the ball. I’d redesign these &#8220;extra-wide&#8221; pages to be the default width.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple this week announced a major shakeup to its App Store commission rate. The company, as of January 1, 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">will only charge App Store developers 15% on paid apps and in-app purchases</a> if their business has not exceeded $1 million in proceeds during 2020 for all their apps combined. Qualification for the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i7jzeefs">new App Store Small Business Program</a>, as it&#8217;s called, will be re-assessed revenues on an annual basis going forward.</p>
<p>The changes arrive at a time when Apple has been under increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html">regulatory</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html">scrutiny</a> over how its App Store operates, which includes antitrust investigations in the U.S. and E.U. It has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat/">waged war</a> with developers throughout the year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/this-week-in-apps-apple-delays-mobile-ad-apocalypse-app-review-changes-tiktok-deal-gets-complicated/">over </a>in-app purchases, leading the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">to revise its already complex rules</a> even further, and spell out how and when it gets to charge its so-called &#8220;Apple tax.&#8221; And it&#8217;s in the middle of a nasty <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/judge-rules-that-apple-can-ban-fortnite-but-cant-terminate-epics-unreal-developer-accounts/">legal battle</a> with Fortnite maker Epic Games, which doesn&#8217;t want to be forced to use Apple payments or even, necessarily, the App Store.</p>
<p>The commission changes may help silence some disgruntled voices from the wider app development community, while giving Apple a way to show regulators that it&#8217;s enabling fair competition.</p>
<p>However, several of Apple&#8217;s largest and harshest critics reacted negatively to the news.</p>
<p>The advocacy group, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">the Coalition for App Fairness,</a> which includes Epic, Basecamp, Deezer, Match Group, Spotify and many others, said: &#8220;developers want a level playing field from Apple, not a symbolic gesture.&#8221; They argued that Apple still owns the customer relationship, the threshold of $1M is arbitrary, and they said the majority of developers who &#8220;generate livable revenue,&#8221; won&#8217;t benefit.</p>

<p>Apple, though, had claimed the change would benefit the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the App Store development community. Today its App Store hosts 1.8 million apps that reach more than 1.5 billion Apple devices.</p>
<p>Individual developers we spoke to, including those who would qualify for the program, weren&#8217;t complaining. And <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1329118937636802566">many were fairly surprised</a> by Apple&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s fair to say that this change wouldn&#8217;t have happened without either the impending antitrust investigations, or the Epic lawsuit. But something can be both a very clever piece of political manoeuvring, and still genuinely welcome and beneficial to the vast majority of developers out there,&#8221; said indie developer <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesthomson">James Thomson</a>, maker of the <a href="https://tla.systems/">PCalc app</a> and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fall significantly under the million dollar threshold, so we&#8217;re looking at roughly a 20% increase in our income under the new system. We&#8217;re in a much better position than most businesses under the pandemic, in that our sales are purely digital and people always need calculators (or dice), but we&#8217;ve certainly seen a decrease in sales over the last eight months. I can see the current situation taking a good while to resolve, so that extra revenue is appreciated,&#8221; he added. &#8220;These changes will particularly help the small developers who have traditionally been the heart of the developer community, and I as happy about this, as I am surprised,&#8221; Thomson said.</p>
<p>Others also said they were generally happy with the changes. But some expressed reservations about the details of how the program works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, I&#8217;m very pleased with this new program,&#8221; said developer <a href="https://www.david-smith.org/apps/">David Smith</a>, maker of Widgetsmith, Watchsmith, Sleep++ and a range of other iOS apps. &#8220;It will help countless small developers who can really benefit from that extra margin. I&#8217;m excited for all the indie developers who will now be able to focus full time on their apps just that little bit sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Smith noted that it was odd that the program isn&#8217;t applied in a way that&#8217;s similar to a graduated tax rate, where, he explained, &#8220;your first $1M is at 15% and the rest at the higher rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposed system creates an awkward differentiation between developers, and one of the things I&#8217;ve always appreciated most about the App Store was that it treats developers equally,&#8221; Smith continued. &#8220;It also creates a strange disincentive for growth for mid-sized businesses who are approaching the threshold.&#8221;</p>
<p>We turned to third-party analytics firms to try to better understand the market.</p>
<p>According to App Annie data, around 98% of all iOS developers in 2019 (meaning, unique publisher accounts) fell under the $1 million annual consumer spend threshold. This supports Apple&#8217;s claims that the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of developers would benefit. This group of developers accounts for 567,000 unique apps, or 93% of all apps generating revenue through in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Combined, their revenues represented just under 8% of the overall App Store revenue share &#8212; in other words, it&#8217;s money Apple could stand to lose.</p>

<p>App Annie also found that the group of mid-range developers who are &#8220;nearing&#8221; that $1 million threshold is really small. The data indicates roughly 0.5% of developers are making between $800,000 and $1 million. And just over 1% are in the $500,000-$800,000 range.</p>
<p>Most developers have much smaller revenue streams, with 87.7% making less than $100,000 in 2019.</p>

<p>Some expressed concern that Apple&#8217;s system would unfairly penalize developers who made just $1 over the $1 million threshold, and then trap them at the higher rate (30%).</p>

<p>From the data we&#8217;ve collected, it seems that subscription-based apps tend to keep growing fairly quickly once they pass that $1 million threshold. According to data from subscription platform <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>, the apps on its platform grow, on average, at 1.5x year-over-year. So once an app crossed the $1 million threshold, the most likely scenario is that it would make $1.5 million the next year. Plus, the apps that are &#8220;nearing&#8221; the threshold tend to be growing even faster than the average rate, we understand. And they rarely backslide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple has made a lot of changes to the App Store over the years, and this is one of the first I’ve seen where there’s really not much to complain about,&#8221; said RevenueCat CEO Jacob Eiting. &#8220;It’s impactful to the App Store economy broadly and meaningful to individual indie developers. Sure it may have been for PR and they might not have a lot of downside in doing this, but it’s genuinely a great thing for so many developers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>Parler&#8217;s funders revealed&#8230;it&#8217;s the Mercers; parents warned about the app</h2>
<p>The &#8220;Free speech&#8221; app Parler rising in the charts after Facebook and Twitter increased fact-checks, turns out to be funded by prominent conservative donor and Trump supporter Rebekah Mercer, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parler-backed-by-mercer-family-makes-play-for-conservatives-mad-at-facebook-twitter-11605382430?mod=djemalertNEWS">The WSJ revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Rebekah is the daughter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer">Robert Mercer,</a> the hedge fund manager and principal investor in Cambridge Analytica &#8212; the data analytics firm behind the largest data leak in Facebook history, where 87 million users had their data harvested for the purposes of political advertising.

<p>This week, the nonprofit ParentsTogether issued a warning to parents about Parler, saying that the app&#8217;s weak moderation policies and extremist user base put kids at risk of exploitation, abuse and recruitment for racist violence. The organization described Parler as hosting dangerous content, including hate speech, incitements of violence and widespread disinformation.</p>
<p>In addition, the group was concerned that while Apple&#8217;s App Store rates the app at 17+, Google Play has it listed as suitable for kids ages 13+.</p>
<p>&#8220;All parents of children under age 18 to immediately check their kids’ phones and tablets to ensure that their children have not installed Parler,&#8221; the group warned parents, in a statement. &#8220;If your child has installed Parler, we strongly recommend that you delete their account and the app.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">launched</a> its own version of Stories — aka “Fleets” — to its global user base. The product, which allows users to post ephemeral content that disappears in 24 hours, had already rolled out to select markets, including Brazil, India, Italy, South Korea and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/twitter-brings-its-stories-feature-fleets-to-japan/">most recently, Japan</a>. The rollout <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitters-new-stories-feature-fleets-is-already-struggling/">almost immediately ran into some snags,</a> with Fleets suffering performance and stability issues. Twitter said it would pause things while it worked this out. On Thursday, the company announced the feature <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1329621123768741891">was globally available</a>.</p>
<p>Reactions to Fleets has been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-fleets-reactions/">mixed</a>. Some users hate the feature, which is designed to encourage more users to post to Twitter, when they&#8217;ve otherwise been too shy to participate &#8212; largely because of Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; vibe where mistakes, bad takes and unpopular opinions are harshly criticized, even when they&#8217;re more minor offenses. It&#8217;s not clear how a Stories feature resolves this, however, as Fleets are still being published to Twitter&#8217;s public social network.</p>
<p>Twitter also said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">will begin testing a Clubhouse rival</a> where users will join audio chat rooms.</p>

<p>Google Pay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">launched a major redesign of its app on Android and iOS</a> this week with a ton of new features, including a mobile bank account. The company partnered with 11 banks, including Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union, to launch Plex, a mobile banking service where accounts are held at partner banks but Google Pay operates as the front end. Plex users will have no monthly fees, overdraft charges or minimum balances and can pay both businesses and friends from their account. They can also explore offers and rewards to save money while shopping and get spending insights, including from their connected bank accounts outside the app. Another new feature makes it easier to split bills with friends, like restaurant checks, rent or utilities.</p>

This is the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich Mission, which carries a satellite of the same name developed by the European Space Agency, NASA, and both U.S. and European meteorological monitoring bodies.</p>
<p>The Sentinel-6 is named for former NASA Earth Science Division Director Michael Freilich, who occupied the position between 2006 and 2019 and passed away in August. It&#8217;s one of two Sentinel-6-series satellites that will be launched for the program, with the Sentinel-6B set to join the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich sometime in 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

This is the first SpaceX launch from Vandenberg since June of last year, though it has flown plenty of missions from both Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>The webcast above will go live approximately 15 minutes prior to the liftoff time, so at around 9:02 AM PST (12:02 PM EST). Should this mission have to be canceled today, there&#8217;s a backup opportunity set for Sunday at 9:04 AM PST (12:04 PM PST).</p>

This your Daily Crunch for November 20, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Roblox is going public</strong></p>
<p>The child-friendly gaming company filed confidentially to go public in October, but it only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">published its S-1 document</a> with financial information late yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>How do the numbers look? Well, Roblox is certainly growing quickly — total revenue increased 56% in 2019, and then another 68% in the first three quarters of 2020, when it saw $588.7 million in revenue. At the same time, losses are growing as well, nearly quadrupling to $203.2 million during those same three quarters.</p>
<p>The company also acknowledged that its success depends on its ability to “provide a safe online environment” for children. Otherwise, “business will suffer dramatically.”</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/snap-acquired-voisey-an-app-to-create-music-tracks-overlaying-your-own-vocals/">Snap acquired Voisey, an app to create music tracks overlaying your own vocals</a> — Voisey users can apply audio filters to their voices, and they can browse and view other people’s Voisey tracks.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/">Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over censorship law</a> — This comes after Pakistan&#8217;s government granted blanket powers to local regulators to censor digital content.</p>
<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>

<p>Tech companies that go public capture our imagination because they are literal happy endings. An Initial Public Offering is the promised land for startup pilgrims who may wander the desert for years seeking product-market fit. After all, the &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;ISO&#8221; stands for &#8220;incentive.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flurry of new S-1s in a single week forced me to rearrange our editorial calendar, but I didn&#8217;t mind; our 360-degree coverage let some of the air out of various hype balloons and uncovered several unique angles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example: I was familiar with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the service that lets consumers finance purchases, but I had no idea Peloton accounted for 30% of its total revenue in the last quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens if Peloton puts on the brakes?&#8221; I asked Alex Wilhelm as I edited <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/inside-affirms-ipo-filing-a-look-at-its-economics-profits-and-revenue-concentration/">his breakdown of Affirm&#8217;s S-1</a>. We decided to use that as the subhead for his analysis.</p>

<p>Gaming company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/what-is-roblox-worth/">Roblox filed to go public</a> yesterday afternoon, so Alex Wilhelm brought out a scalpel and dissected its S-1. Using his patented <em>mathmagic</em>, he analyzed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fundraising history and reported revenue to estimate where its valuation might land.</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;the public markets appear to be even more risk-on than the private world in 2020,&#8221; Alex pegged the number at &#8220;just a hair under $10 billion.&#8221;</p>

<p>For all the hype about new forms of payment, the way I transact hasn&#8217;t been radically transformed in recent years — even in tech-centric San Francisco.</p>
<p>Sure, I use NFC card readers to tap and pay and tipped a street musician using Venmo last weekend. But my landlord still demands paper checks and there&#8217;s a tattered &#8220;CASH ONLY&#8221; taped to the register at my closest coffee shop.</p>
<p>In China, it&#8217;s a different story: Alibaba&#8217;s employee cafeteria uses facial recognition and AI to determine which foods a worker has selected and who to charge. Many consumers there use the same app to pay for utility bills, movie tickets and hamburgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, nobody except Chinese people outside of China uses Alipay or WeChat Pay to pay for anything,&#8221; says finance researcher Martin Chorzempa. &#8220;So that’s a big unexplored side that I think is going to come into a lot of geopolitical risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>After reviewing Affirm&#8217;s profitability, revenue and the impact of COVID-19 on its bottom line, he asked (and answered) three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does Affirm’s loss rate on consumer loans look like?</li>
<li>Are its gross margins improving?</li>
<li>What does the unicorn have to say about contribution profit from its loans business?</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;The only thing more rare than a unicorn is an exited unicorn,&#8221; observes Managing Editor Danny Crichton, who looked back at Exitpalooza 2020 to answer &#8220;a simple question &#8212; who made the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Covering each exit from the perspective of founders and investors, Danny makes it clear who&#8217;ll take home the largest slice of each pie. TL;DR? &#8220;Some really colossal winners among founders, and several venture firms walking home with billions of dollars in capital.</p>

<ul>
<li>How far did Airbnb’s bookings fall during Q1 and Q2?</li>
<li>How far have Airbnb’s bookings come back since?</li>
<li>Did local, long-term stays save Airbnb?</li>
<li>Has Airbnb ever really made money?</li>

<p>Earlier this week, Autodesk announced its purchase of Spacemaker, a Norwegian firm that develops AI-supported software for urban development.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Steve O&#8217;Hear interviewed Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost to learn more about the acquisition and asked why Autodesk paid $240 million for Spacemaker&#8217;s 115-person team and IP — especially when there were other startups closer to its Bay Area HQ.</p>
<p>&#8220;They’ve built a real, practical, usable application that helps a segment of our population use machine learning to really create better outcomes in a critical area, which is urban redevelopment and development,&#8221; said Anagnost.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it’s totally aligned with what we’re trying to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his new book, &#8220;Subprime Attention Crisis,&#8221; writer/researcher Tim Hwang attempts to answer a question I&#8217;ve wondered about for years: does advertising actually work?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/is-the-internet-advertising-economy-about-to-implode/">Managing Editor Danny Crichton interviewed Hwang</a> to learn more about his thesis that there are parallels between today&#8217;s ad industry and the subprime mortgage crisis that helped spur the Great Recession.</p>
<p>So, are online ads effective?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the companies are very reticent to give up the data that would allow you to find a really definitive answer to that question,&#8221; says Hwang.</p>

<p>Even after much of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, we will still be using Zoom&#8217;s video-conferencing platform in great numbers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Zoom isn&#8217;t just an app: it&#8217;s also a platform play for startups that add functionality using APIs, an SDK or chatbots that behave like smart assistants.</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller spoke to entrepreneurs and investors who are leveraging Zoom&#8217;s platform to build new applications with an eye on the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;By offering a platform to build applications that take advantage of the meeting software, it’s possible it could be a valuable new ecosystem for startups,&#8221; says Ron.</p>

<p>Without an on-campus experience, many students (and their parents) are wondering how much value there is in attending classes via a laptop in a dormitory.</p>
<p>Even worse: Declining enrollment is leading many institutions to eliminate majors and find other ways to cut costs, like furloughing staff and cutting athletic programs.</p>
<p>Edtech solutions could fill the gap, but there&#8217;s no real consensus in higher education over which tools work best. Many colleges and universities are using a number of &#8220;third-party solutions to keep operations afloat,&#8221; reports Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a stress test that could lead to a reckoning among edtech startups.&#8221;</p>

<p>I look for guest-written Extra Crunch stories that will help other entrepreneurs be more successful, which is why I routinely turn down submissions that seem overly promotional.</p>
<p>However, Henrik Torstensson (CEO and co-founder of Lifesum) submitted a post about the techniques he&#8217;s used to scale his nutrition app over the last three years. &#8220;It’s a strategy any startup can use, regardless of size or budget,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, Lifesum is growing almost twice as fast as Noon and Weight Watchers, so putting his company at the center of the story made sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.foodboss.com">FoodBoss</a> aims to be something like Kayak for online food ordering — the place where you can search across different service and apps to find the lowest prices and fastest delivery times.</p>
<p>One limitation, however, is the fact that the service was limited to third-party services like Uber Eats and Postmates, with no way to order from the restaurant itself — until recently, with the launch of a new feature called Restaurant Direct.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/foodboss" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="foodboss">FoodBoss <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Michael DiBenedetto said that restaurants are placing an increasing emphasis on accepting delivery and pickup orders directly, both to save on the fees they pay to third-party services, and also to have a direct relationship with their customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The main problem is they spent all this money to build out the [ordering] infrastructure, but they don&#8217;t necessarily know that they have to spend marketing dollars to drive consumers to their site or app,&#8221; DiBenedetto said. &#8220;That’s where we’re really helping.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077096" style="width: 369px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077096" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2077096" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?w=359" alt="FoodBoss" width="359" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg 1048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=79,150 79w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=159,300 159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=768,1453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=359,680 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=812,1536 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foodboss.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077096" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FoodBoss</p></div></p>
<p>Restaurant Direct may present some additional technical hurdles, because it will require FoodBoss to integrate with a variety of ordering systems. DiBenedetto said the company will be connecting through APIs in some cases and can also work directly with restaurant IT departments.</p>
<p>He emphasized that FoodBoss will remain agnostic about how you order — the goal is just to show you all the options, and to highlight the ordering method that best matches your priorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;At FoodBoss, we&#8217;re focused on making sure we&#8217;re helping third parties and [restaurants] have a lower overall marketing cost,&#8221; DiBenedetto continued. &#8220;Everybody wants to be profitable on delivery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first restaurant available through Restaurant Direct is Lou Malnati’s in Chicago, with plans to add Sbarro in multiple markets next year. In a statement, Lou Malnati&#8217;s president, Heather Stege, said, &#8220;The challenge for restaurants is being able to serve customers through the users preferred channels, while still providing them with exceptional food. FoodBoss helps simplify that by offering multiple options, including our own, to attract customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last time<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/joyrun-a-food-delivery-app-with-a-twist-raises-8-5-million/"> we wrote about JoyRun</a>, it was raising $10 million. Today, the Bay Area startup has some very different news to share, as it becomes part of Walmart as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has purchased select assets in a bid to enhance its supply chain. The mega-retailer announced today that it has acquired &#8220;select assets – including the talent, technology platform and IP&#8221; from the company, in a bid to incorporate its peer-to-peer food and drink delivery service into its own last-mile logistics.</p>
<p>Walmart EVP Srini Venkatesan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/srini-venkatesan_this-acquisition-allows-us-to-further-augment-activity-6735295576902115328-Q4au/">notes</a> that the app has amassed a network of 540 third-party merchant partners and north of 30,000 people who have delivered goods with the service since its launch half-a-decade ago. JoyRun’s service is a bit of twist on more standard delivery apps like Seamless and Uber Eats.</p>
<p>As we described it back in 2017, “The company’s app lets people find out who, nearby, is already heading out to a restaurant that they like, then tack on an order of their own.” It will be interesting to see how Walmart integrates this technology into its existing chain, though from the sound it, Walmart would essentially be relying on non-professionals to delivery goods like groceries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system would likely operate in a manner like Amazon Flex — a kind of Uber/Lyft gig economy-style approach to delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This acquisition allows us to further augment our team and ongoing efforts to explore even more ways to deliver for customers in the future,” Venkatesan adds. “For instance, Runners could complement our SPARK program and 3rd Party delivery providers. Our goal is to deliver as quickly and efficiently as possible.”</p>
<p>Walmart expects the deal to close “in the coming weeks,” which will incorporate <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/joyrun" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="joyrun">JoyRun <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> into its Supply Chain Technology team. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kea.ai">Kea</a> is a new startup giving restaurants an opportunity to upgrade one of the more old-fashioned ways that they take orders — over the phone.</p>
<p>Today, Kea is announcing that it has raised a $10 million Series A led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/marbruck" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="marbruck">Marbruck, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Streamlined Ventures, Xfund, Heartland Ventures, DEEPCORE, Barrel Ventures and AVG Funds, as well as angel investors Raj Kapoor (chief strategy officer at Lyft), Craig Flom (who was on the founding team at Panera Bread), Wingstop franchisee Tony Lam and Five Guys franchisee Jonathan Kelly.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Adam Ahmad said that with restaurants perpetually understaffed, they usually don&#8217;t have someone who can devote their attention to answering the phone. (Many of you, after all, are probably pretty familiar with the experience of calling a restaurant and being immediately placed on hold.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, he suggested it remains an important ordering channel — especially during the pandemic, as takeout and delivery has become the biggest source of revenue for many restaurants. The New Yorker&#8217;s Helen Rosner put it succinctly when she suggested that anyone who wants to support restaurants should &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/pick-up-the-damn-phone-and-other-thoughts-on-ordering-restaurant-delivery">pick up the damn phone.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, Ahmad said that for restaurants, paying substantial third-party ordering fees on all of their orders is &#8220;not a sustainable long-term strategy.&#8221; So Kea is offering technology that should help restaurants handle more orders over the phone, creating what Ahmad called a &#8220;virtual cashier&#8221; who can do the initial intake with customers, process most routine orders and bring in a human employee when needed.</p>
<p>The idea of an automated voice assistant may bring back unpleasant memories of trying to call your bank or another Byzantine customer service department. But Ahmad said that while most existing phone systems are &#8220;not smart,&#8221; Kea&#8217;s AI is very different, because it&#8217;s just focused on restaurant ordering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re doing a very closed domain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the pizza world, there are only a couple thousand permutations. We&#8217;re not innovating for the whole dictionary — it&#8217;s a constrained model, it&#8217;s a menu.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the Kea team gave me a number to dial where I could try out the system for myself. It was a pretty straightforward and easy process, where I provided my address and then the details of my pizza order. And again, you can transfer to a human employee at any time. (In fact, I was accidentally transferred during my demo, leading me to quickly hang up in embarrassment.)</p>
<p>Kea is already live in more than 250 restaurants, including Papa John’s, Donatos and Primanti Brothers, and it says it&#8217;s saving them an average of 10 hours of labor per week, with a 23% increase in average order size. With the new funding, Ahmad&#8217;s goal is to bring Kea to 1,000 restaurants across 37 states in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/luminar-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="luminar-technologies">Luminar, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the buzzy sensor startup that is on the verge of becoming a publicly traded company, locked in a supplier deal to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The deal, announced Friday, will see a rising star paired with a company that has long dominated the automotive industry. While the supplier agreement is nowhere near the scale of Mobileye&#8217;s core computer vision business, it is an important collaboration that extends beyond a few pilot programs. Luminar has had a development agreement with Mobileye for nearly two years now. This new agreement signals the next critical step for both companies.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s camera-based sensors are used by most automakers to support advanced driver assistance systems. Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology. But the company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has branched out in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. Two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018/">REM mapping system</a> and software algorithms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mobileye has since ratcheted up its self-driving ambitions and taken what some in the industry see as an unlikely turn to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier.</p>
<p>Luminar and Mobileye&#8217;s agreement while small at the moment is still a production contract. Luminar&#8217;s lidar will be part of Mobileye&#8217;s first-generation fleet of driverless vehicles, which are being piloted in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Paris, China and Daegu City, South Korea. Mobileye&#8217;s ultimate aim is to expand its robotaxi operations and sell its self-driving stack (or AV series solution) to other companies. Mobileye CEO Ammon Shashua has said the company is targeting commercial robotaxi services to be launched in 2022.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye signs driver-assistance deal with Geely, one of China&#8217;s largest privately held auto makers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/mobileye-signs-driver-assistance-deal-with-geely-one-of-chinas-largest-privately-held-auto-makers/embed/#?secret=xY3tjwullV" data-secret="xY3tjwullV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So you basically have a production deal here to be able to equip their vehicles towards the 2022 launch of their service and power that in parallel to their camera solution to create that safety and redundancy,&#8221; Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>While the first use of this &#8220;AV series solution&#8221; is for Mobileye&#8217;s own internal fleet, Russell is interested in the opportunities that will follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken a very different strategy and are very different company than any other kind of private AV development company,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;These guys have tens of millions of products deployed on series production vehicles; they know what it takes to put something into series production. So to able to ride that wave and get on the ground floor to be in production vehicles as well was of particular interest for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luminar has landed other production-level deals. Volvo announced in May that it will start producing vehicles in 2022 that are equipped with lidar and a perception stack from Luminar that the automaker will use to deploy an automated driving system for highways. For now, the lidar will be part of a hardware package that consumers can add as an option to a Volvo’s second-generation Scalable Product Architecture vehicles, starting with the XC90. Volvo will combine Luminar’s lidar with cameras, radar, software and back-up systems for functions such as steering, braking and battery power to enable its highway pilot feature.</p>
<p>Daimler&#8217;s trucks division said in October it had invested in Luminar as part of a broader partnership to produce autonomous trucks capable of navigating highways without a human driver behind the wheel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Copy and paste the converted output. --></p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has closed a pair of funds totaling $4.5 billion, the firm confirmed in a<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/11/20/fund-vii-and-growth-fund-ii/"> blog post</a> this morning. The firm has raised $1.3 billion for an early-stage fund focused on consumer, enterprise and fintech; and closed a $3.2 billion growth-stage fund for later-stage investments. The firm did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p>The funds may seem somewhat typical, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/nea-venture-capitals-quiet-giant-closes-on-3-6-billion/">size of new funds</a> that venture firms have been raising in recent years. Still, these are extraordinary amounts given that a16z, with offices in Menlo Park and San Francisco, was founded just 11 years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as extraordinary, they bring the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to $16.5 billion.</p>
<p>It was just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/a16z-ushers-in-new-fund-strategy-with-2-75b/">20 months ago</a> that a16z closed its most recent pair of funds &#8212; a $2 billion late-stage fund, and a $740 million flagship early-stage fund.</p>
<p>It also announced a separate, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">$515 million crypto-focused fund</a> back in April of this year, its second such vehicle. And, in February, it rolled out its third biotech and healthcare investing fund, which <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/andreessen-horowitz-raises-750m-for-its-third-bio-fund">closed with $750 million </a>in capital commitments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of capital to capture in one year. Then again, its limited partners have had reason to feel optimistic about its portfolio. In January, for example, the fintech company Plaid, whose Series C round a16z joined in late 2018, was acquired by Visa for a hefty $5.3 billion after raising roughly $310 million altogether.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">recently sued to block the deal</a> on antitrust grounds, but even if it&#8217;s unwound, industry observers like Plaid&#8217;s prospects.</p>
<p>The firm is also an investor in the soon-to-be-publicly traded accommodations marketplace Airbnb, though notably, according to Airbnb&#8217;s S-1, a16z does not own enough of the company to be listed on the filing, despite that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/airbnb-bags-112-million-in-series-b-from-andreessen-and-others/">led the company&#8217;s Series B round</a> in 2011 and despite that general partner Jeff Jordan sits on the company&#8217;s board and would need to list any ownership position as a result.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked if it sold part or all of its stake, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/60-million-sale-airbnb-shares-signals-private-stock-reboot-2020-5">possibly earlier this year, </a>and are awaiting word back.</p>
<p>Another of a16z&#8217;s portfolio companies, the pay-as-you-go lending company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has also filed to go public. Andreessen Horowitz first participated in the company&#8217;s Series B round back in 2015. It is also not listed on Affirm&#8217;s S-1 filing, meaning it owns less than 5% of the company.</p>
<p>And the firm is an investor in the game company Roblox, whose $150 million Series G round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">led earlier this year</a>. Roblox made its S-1 public earlier this week; a16z is not listed on it.</p>
<p>On the early-stage side, the firm is often characterized by its flashy deals, including its $100 million valuation of voice-chat app <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/?sh=463f0c916f2a">Clubhouse </a>and $75 million valuation of Y Combinator graduate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/ycs-most-anticipated-startup-raised-16m-from-a16z-before-demo-day/">Trove.</a></p>

<p>A16z also recently launched a TxO accelerator, which uses a donor-advised fund to invest in underrepresented founders. Led by a16z partner Nait Jones, TxO has invested $100,000 each in an initial cohort of<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/10/30/announcing-txos-first-cohort/"> seven companies</a> in exchange for 7% of ownership stake.</p>
<p>The donor-advised fund launched with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/andreessen-horowitz-launches-2-2m-fund-to-invest-in-underserved-founders/">$2.2 million in initial commitments</a>, with Ben and Felicia Horowitz announcing they would match up to $5 million. Any returns from companies in the fund will be repurposed into the investment vehicle. The firm has declined to share the fund’s total size to date.</p>

<p>Currently, a16z employs 185 people, most recently hiring Anthony Albanese, the chief regulatory officer at the New York Stock Exchange, as an operating partner for its cryptocurrency team.</p>
<p>One of a16z&#8217;s biggest wins so far appears to be GitHub, which sold to Microsoft in a $7.5 billion all-stock deal in 2018 and from which a16z <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/4/17424664/github-microsoft-sale-andreessen-horowitz-returns-billions">reportedly pocketed more than $1 billion</a>. When it invested in the company, it wrote the biggest check it had issued at the time: $100 million. The terms were enough for a16z to win the deal against some tough competition, including Benchmark, which was also trying to woo GitHub at the time, as general partner, Peter Fenton, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/benchmarks-peter-fenton-10-to-20-years-of-innovation-just-got-pulled-forward/">said recently</a>.</p>
<p>It is also an early investor in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which was last valued by its private investors at $8 billion and is reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/">contemplating an IPO</a>, possibly early next year. And a16z owns a stake in Robinhood, the popular trading app that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-funding/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-raises-660-million-in-latest-funding-round-idUSKCN26E062">in September was valued at $11.7 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Robinhood, too, is said to be contemplating an IPO in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/robinhood-is-said-to-seek-advisers-for-potential-ipo-next-year">near future</a>.</p>

In return, the crowdfunding platform will provide the firm with access to its startup network. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ourcrowd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ourcrowd">OurCrowd <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also says that the two groups will collaborate to create financial products and investment opportunities for the Japanese and global market, including access to its venture funds and specific companies in the OurCrowd portfolio.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">ORIX</span> is a global leader in diversified business and financial services who will strengthen OurCrowd in many ways,&#8221; OurCrowd CEO Jon Medved said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We are enthusiastic about the potential to further transform the venture capital asset class together and provide a strong bridge for our innovative companies to the important Asian markets.”</p>
<p>While ORIX already operates in 37 countries, including the U.S., this is the company&#8217;s first investment in Israel. It comes at a time where Japanese investments in Israel <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/japanese-investments-in-israel-surge-in-2019/">are already surging</a>. And earlier this year, Israel&#8217;s flag carrier El Al was about to launch direct flights to Tokyo, for example, and while the pandemic canceled those plans, it&#8217;s a clear sign of the expanding business relations between the two countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“We are excited about investing in OurCrowd, Israel’s most active venture investor and one of the world’s most innovative venture capital platforms,&#8221; ORIX UK CEO Kiyoshi Habiro said. &#8220;We intend to be active partners with OurCrowd and help them accelerate their already impressive growth, while bringing the best of Israeli tech to Japan’s large industrial and financial sectors.”</p>
<p>So far, OurCrowd has made investments in 220 companies across its 22 funds. Some of its most successful exits include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/beyond-meat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="beyond-meat">Beyond Meat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Lemonade, JUMP Bike, Briefcam and Argus. ORIX, too, has quite a diverse portfolio, with investments that range from real estate to banking and energy services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today released its latest diversity report, showing a decline in the overall representation of Black employees in the U.S. despite an <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/being-an-anti-racist-company">increased focus on racial justice</a> this year in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. In 2019, Uber was 9.3% Black while this year, only 7.5% of its employees are Black.</p>
<p>Uber attributes the decline in Black employees to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/more-uber-layoffs/">layoffs earlier this year</a>, where about 40% of its employees in community operations were laid off, Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company that has so publicly stated its stance on anti-racism, that&#8217;s not acceptable,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That unintentional decline in the Black population at Uber &#8220;led to a lot of soul searching,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Dara was certainly upset by it. Every leader was. It reinforced how easy it is to lose some ground after all the work you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee said her diversity, equity and inclusion team was consulted prior to the layoffs in an attempt to ensure there was no disparate impact on any one group.</p>
<p>&#8220;The unfortunate thing that wasn&#8217;t understood at the time was our customer service org in particular was hit pretty hard,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The overall rate of layoffs was 25-26% in most parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in the customer service organization, about 40% of employees were affected. And that part of the company had a higher representation of Black and Latinx folks than in other areas.</p>
<p>While Uber saw a decline in its overall Black population, it saw an overall net increase in women of color. And in order to get even more granular, Uber plans to start disaggregating the Asian community and Latinx community.</p>
<p>Uber first set diversity goals just last year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/uber-finally-sets-diversity-inclusion-and-equity-goals/">Those goals entailed</a> increasing the percentage of women at levels L5 (manager level) and higher to 35% and increasing the percentage of underrepresented employees at levels L4 (senior associate) and higher to 14% by 2022.</p>

<p>Currently, Uber is 59.7% male, 44.8% white, 37.2% Asian, 7.5% Black, 8.4% Latinx, 1.3% multiracial, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and 0.5% Native American.</p>
<p>Uber does not break out the demographics of its gig workforce, but many studies have shown people of color make up a large portion of the gig economy.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, 78% of gig workers are people of color and 56% of gig workers are immigrants, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/gig-workers-survey-san-francisco/">according to a study conducted by San Francisco’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) and led by UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner.</a></p>
<p>While Lee is not directly responsible for the driver and delivery population, she said they also represent a wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. With that in mind, her team does advise other parts of Uber in policy setting as it relates to gig workers.</p>
<p>Uber has had a contentious relationship with its drivers and delivery workers for the last couple of years, especially in California. That all came to a head when California voters passed Proposition 22, a ballot measure that will keep gig workers classified as independent contractors. Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash collectively proposed and backed the measure with $206 million in funding.</p>
<p>On the other side of the proposition were labor groups representing gig workers. But it wasn&#8217;t just gig workers who opposed the measure. Inside Uber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/human-capital-uber-engineer-explains-why-he-spoke-out-against-prop-22/">engineer Kurt Nelson spoke out</a> against the measure. In fact, he credited the measure as being the final straw that led him to seek other job opportunities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;I’m a software engineer at Uber and I’m voting against Prop 22&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/im-a-software-engineer-at-uber-im-voting-against-prop-22/embed/#?secret=J14HyAjy4Z" data-secret="J14HyAjy4Z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Lee, deciding to support Prop 22 came down to paying attention to &#8220;who gets included and who gets excluded from policies.&#8221; When looking at AB 5, the California bill that changed the way companies could classify their workers, she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t help but notice the majority of independent contractor roles that were predominantly white were being excluded from AB 5.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2257">California exempted</a> from AB 5 fine artists, freelance writers, still photographers, copy editors, producers and other types of professions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if AB 5 was applied differently, I would&#8217;ve landed somewhere else,&#8221; Lee said, being sure to clarify she was speaking for herself and not for Uber. &#8220;For me, I recognize that Prop 22 was the right thing at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said the company plans to advocate for similar laws in other parts of the country and world. It&#8217;s not clear what that will specifically entail, but an Uber spokesperson said the company plans to discuss <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/working-together-priorities/">this type</a> of framework with stakeholders in other states and countries.</p>
