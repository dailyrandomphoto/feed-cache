					<description><![CDATA[The players in the space that we can name and track are generally cash-rich and market-sentiment poor.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hippo began to trade earlier this week after completing its SPAC combination. The home-focused U.S. neoinsurance provider initially stuck close to its $10 per-share pre-combination price before plummeting yesterday during regular trading.</p>
<p>But Hippo&#8217;s declines don&#8217;t appear to be of its own doing. Lemonade, another U.S. neoinsurance player — albeit one more focused on rental coverage — posted slightly <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3725469-lemonade-eps-in-line-beats-on-revenue">better-than-expected Q2 results</a> earlier in the week. After its report, Lemonade&#8217;s value dropped sharply, and it appears it dragged Hippo down with it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The trading volatility is interesting on its own, but what matters more is that the drop in the value of several neoinsurance companies is part of a larger trend. This week&#8217;s declines are not incredibly surprising — the market has negatively repriced tech-enabled insurance providers in recent quarters, which can be an uncomfortable situation for a category that previously basked in warm attention from public investors.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we&#8217;d typically riff on the new values of public neoinsurance companies and use that data to work our way into a guess concerning what the price declines might mean for related startups. Taking public-market data and using it to better understand private markets is pretty much the national pastime of this column.</p>
<p>Not today. Instead, we&#8217;re going to look into an interesting dynamic among neoinsurance companies that may matter a bit more for our comprehension of the private markets. Namely that the players in the space that we can name and track are generally cash-rich and market-sentiment poor.</p>
<p>Public markets are cutting the value of neoinsurance stocks, but the companies behind the valuation declines are rather wealthy. This makes their enterprise values smaller than you might guess from a quick glance at their market cap figures. But do Lemonade or Hippo really care if the stock market decides from one quarter to the next that their businesses are worth plus or minus 10%? Do they have enough cash to pursue their long-term visions, regardless?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack all the numbers, discuss an interview The Exchange held with Hippo CEO Assaf Wand earlier in the week and consider what Lemonade had to say during its earnings call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As startups in Africa continue to grow and raise money at a ridiculous pace, so too will their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap tables expand. Most African startups&#8217; bulk of VC money is from foreign investors, making it imperative for African startups to incorporate abroad, especially in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processes for incorporation are quite complicated, and even though most founders still get the hang of it, they risk the chance of messing up their cap tables. For instance, some Nigerian startups are guilty of issuing preferred shares in naira and then canceling to issue dollar-denominated SAFEs when they get incorporated in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raise, a startup building Africa&#8217;s Carta is tackling these challenges and has received backing from 500 Startups to scale its technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Marvin Coleby, Tina Nyamache and Eugene Mutai set out to create a blockchain solution that would make it easier for people to buy and sell shares in pre-IPO companies in Africa. After running several iterations, they found out that most companies still struggled with the concept of equity and liquidity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They spent money managing corporate structures for holding companies in Delaware, Canada, and Europe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintained paper-based subsidiaries across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Coleby, most of the equity across Africa is still stored, tracked and updated using paper certificates, manual processes and fragmented government databases. This raises transaction costs to manage subsidiaries and issue employee stock options. It also inflates costs to enter and exit positions in private and public companies.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186529" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186529" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186529" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?w=680" alt="Raise" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186529" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Raise</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they started Raise to help startups, investors, employees, and law firms manage deals, cap tables and corporate compliance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, Raise customers can also automate due diligence, set valuations, track employee stock vesting and make routine documentation for licenses and government documents in Nigeria and Kenya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Raise launched in 2019, it was in private beta and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was backed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Binance Labs, the sole investor in its pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since proceeding to a public beta in 2020, Raise has onboarded customers like <a href="https://www.getraise.io/post/announcing-our-partnership-with-adili">Anjarwalla &amp; Khanna, Africa’s largest law firm</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; startups Bamboo, Workpay and Mono; and VC firms like Microtraction and Chrysalis Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the long-term problem Raise is trying to solve is liquidity, Coleby tells TechCrunch on a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything we do is to find a way to make it easier for founders, customers, employees, investors to get liquidity from investing in companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies are raising money, people are investing, and employees are getting stock options. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are only one or two exits now and then. That&#8217;s because we build with the Silicon Valley model where we have to grow, scale until we get some big exit. From our perspective, liquidity doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. It can be small little pieces of liquidity that employees and investors get over time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that measure, Africa’s capital markets for private and public companies are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">painfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illiquid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It takes several months or years to buy or sell equity, and, according to Raise, over $1 trillion of stock in Africa is &#8220;illiquid, paper-based and priced in inflationary currencies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian stock trading platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/nigerian-investment-platform-chaka-secures-1-5m-pre-seed-after-bagging-countrys-first-sec-license/">Chaka</a>, Bamboo and Trove help Nigerians create liquidity for assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internationally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Raise aims to build the platform behind them to streamline more asset classes and investment opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that&#8217;s still in the works, Raise organizes ownership data for African companies and makes them accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a similar play to what Carta, a $3 billion company offering cap table software, does for U.S. companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, onboarding cap tables and equity data will also open up use cases for Carta to become a blockchain-based digital asset platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The plan is to become more like Africa’s Nasdaq for private companies as i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t hopes to sell indexes, ETFs, futures, and assets for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleby says in that way, Raise will become an equity engine for processing Africa’s hundreds of billion dollars of trade and securities volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleby says the number of companies going live is increasing 60% month-on-month. The platform manages about 200 cap tables with assets worth more than $400 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next phase of growth, according to Coleby, will be onboarding Series A and growth-stage companies onto the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is active in Nigeria and Kenya. Coleby says a seed round is in the works to continue growing deeper into those markets and experiment with funding and liquidity operations across the African VC space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Raise is building a marketplace that continues connecting and educating investors, employees, and founders in one platform with their law firms to use trusted and verified data to do deals and issue stock options to employees.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foldables! Two, probably! Those are your headliners. Samsung tipped its hand with the event invite, which features a pair of geometrical objects that pretty clearly represent the new Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip.</p>
<p>The other headliner is what we won’t be seeing at the event (Deadliner? Endliner?). The company already confirmed via corporate blog that we won’t be seeing the next version of the Galaxy Note next week. That’s a big break from the device’s long-standing annual refresh cycle.</p>
<p>We still don’t know if this is the end-end of the line for the phablet. Samsung told TechCrunch, “We will not be launching new Galaxy Note devices in 2021. Instead, Samsung plans to continue to expand the Note experience and bring many of its popular productivity and creativity features, including the S Pen, across our Galaxy ecosystem. We will share more details on our future portfolio once we are ready to announce.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186428" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186428" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2186428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Rumors surfaced prior to this revelation that the company may have been forced to put the device on hold, as global supply chain issues continue to hamstring manufacturers. There’s also an argument to be made, however, that Samsung has gradually made the Note redundant over the past several Galaxy S updates.</p>
<p>It seems telling that the company referred to a forthcoming “flagship” in its official Unpacked copy. With the Note out of the picture and the Galaxy S about six months out from a refresh, this appears to refer to the Galaxy Fold gaining the (admittedly ceremonial) title. Whether that means two or three flagships in the company’s Armada remains to be seen.</p>
<p>What we do know, however, is that &#8212; like the Galaxy S before it &#8212; at least one of the forthcoming foldables will be blurring that Note line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I hope you’ll join us as we debut our next Galaxy Z family and share some foldable surprises — including the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones,” the company’s president and head of Mobile Communications Business, TM Roh wrote. The executive also promised “even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger material” on the new Galaxy Z Flip.</p>
<p>Previous &#8212; and subsequent &#8212; leaks have given us good looks at both the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3. Hell, it wouldn’t be a Samsung event if pretty much everything didn’t leak out prior to the event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember that pricing is almost never a direct conversion across markets and currencies. <a href="https://t.co/MLvLUynwjG">https://t.co/MLvLUynwjG</a> <a href="https://t.co/fdbRvnySu6">pic.twitter.com/fdbRvnySu6</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Evan (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422375304543326211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A series of tweets from EVLeaks has given us nearly every angle of the upcoming foldable smartphones, along with (European) prices that put the Fold and Flip starting at €1,899 and €1,099, respectively. Both mark a sizable decrease from the previous generation. That’s nice &#8212; if not entirely surprising. Samsung’s plan all along has clearly been a prolonged drop in pricing as foldable technology scaled. We’re still a long ways away from cheap here, but perhaps nudging our way toward the realm of possibility for more users.</p>
<p>Other leaked details for the Fold/Flip include a 7.6/6.7-inch internal display, a Snapdragon 888 processor (both) and 12MP triple/dual cameras, respectively. Interestingly, water resistance is also reportedly on board here.</p>
<p>With a year of virtual events under its belt, the company seems to have a better idea of pacing. Samsung &#8212; along with many other companies in the space &#8212; took liberties when events went more from in-person to online, meting out announcements event by event. Thankfully, next week’s Unpacked is a much bigger, self-contained event.</p>
<p>The other expected highlights are both wearables. First is the long-awaited fruits of the partnership between Samsung and Google that was announced at I/O. We didn’t get a lot of info at the time, beyond the fact that it will potentially be a boon for users and developers, with the ability to jointly create apps for both the beleaguered Wear OS and Samsung’s custom brand of Tizen.</p>

<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said at a June follow-up to the I/O news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>The company held an (admittedly disappointing) event at MWC focused on the forthcoming watch. There was, however, one key thing missing: the watch. Based on pure speculation, I’d suggest that the wearable just didn’t come together on the timeline Samsung was expecting, but the company went ahead and did a virtual presser at the (mostly virtual) trade show.</p>
<p>The company did, however, announced One UI Watch &#8212; a wearable version of its streamlined OS interface. Samsung notes in a press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience. As part of the new experience, once you install watch-compatible apps on your smartphone, they will be swiftly downloaded onto your smartwatch. If you’ve customized your clock app on your phone to show the time in different cities around the globe, this will be automatically reflected on your watch as well. And if you block calls and messages from your watch, they will now be blocked on your smartphone, too.</p></blockquote>

<p>Leaks have also revealed the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic models along with (again) European pricing. They’re reportedly set to start at €279 and €379, respectively, with each featuring multiple sizing options. That last bit was always a sticking point for me with Samsung watches, which have traditionally been fairly massive, knocking out a good number of potential buyers in the process.</p>
<p>The last big piece of the puzzle are the Galaxy Buds 2. The latest upgrade to the company’s entry-level buds are said to be gaining active noise canceling.</p>
<p>Will there be surprises once things kick off at <strong>7AM PT</strong>/<strong>10AM ET on August 11</strong>? Little, ones, probably. These leaks have a tendency to capture things in broad strokes but miss some of the key nuances in the process. And while the company is more than a little familiar with pre-show leaks, it’s still managed to surprise us in the past.</p>

<p>SpaceX has achieved another major milestone in its Starship fully reusable launch system: It stacked the Starship spacecraft itself on top of a prototype of its Super Heavy booster, which itself is loaded up with a full complement of 29 Raptor rocket engines, and the Starship on top has six itself. The stacked spacecraft now represents the tallest assembled rocket ever developed in history.</p>
<p>This stacking, which happened at SpaceX&#8217;s development site in south Texas, is a significant development because it&#8217;s the first time the two elements of the full Starship system have been united as one. This is the configuration that will be used for launching the next Starship prototype on its test mission that will hopefully achieve orbit.</p>
<p>Taken together, the massive combined launch system reaches nearly 400 feet tall (around 390 feet, to be more precise), and combined with the orbital launch stand on which it rests, the whole thing is about 475 feet high, which is taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>
<p>The stacking itself is impressive, but don&#8217;t expect it to last: The likely next step is for the two halves of the launch system to be separated again, with both undergoing more work, analysis and testing ahead of a reassembly in preparation for the actual eventual orbital launch test.</p>
<p>As for when the orbital launch test will actually take place, it&#8217;s not currently clear. The disassembly, testing and reassembly will take some time, but the company is definitely still aiming to make that happen before end of year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Austin-based company’s technology creates an infrastructure for healthcare provider data management that puts providers at the center.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/austin-based-verifiable-raises-3-million-for-its-api-toolkit-to-verify-healthcare-credentials/">$3 million seed round</a>, <a href="https://verifiable.com/">Verifiable</a> snapped up another $17 million for its healthcare provider credentialing API toolkit.</p>
<p>The Austin-based company’s technology creates an infrastructure for healthcare provider data management that puts providers at the center. Verifiable founder Nick Macario told TechCrunch that data fuels critical operations across health systems and insurance carriers, like contracting, credentialing, enrollment, claims and directories. All of this is being done manually now, and often inaccurately, which is leading to billions of dollars of annual waste.</p>
<p>Verifiable’s infrastructure manages healthcare providers and automates the verification of provider data, enabling automation of business processes like credentialing, payer enrollment and network management for virtual healthcare platforms, health systems and insurance payers. It is able to reduce credentialing turnaround times by over 70%, Macario said.</p>
<p>Insurance payers is the newest part of the company’s expansion that includes verifying provider directories. For example, the information that pops up when someone performs an in-network search on their healthcare plan’s website to find a certain provider in their area.</p>

<p>The Altman brothers led the $17 million Series A round and was joined by David Sacks/Craft Ventures and a group of individual investors including Flexport’s Ryan Petersen, Rippling’s Parker Conrad, Front’s Mathilde Collin, Syapse’s Jonathan Hirsch, Todd Goldberg and Rahul Vohra. Tiger Global and existing investors also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Macario was also planning to raise another round of funding, but he said the combination of an inflection point with the product and Jack Altman’s continued investment interest made it a good time to start scaling the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altman said the general space of healthcare technology has potential. It is also a topic near to him &#8212; his wife is a nurse. He was speaking to her about what Verifiable was working on, and she told him that there are still teams of people doing this.</p>
<p>“So much data is flowing through, and because healthcare is such a massive part of the country’s GDP, there is so much potential that can be unlocked,” Altman added. “I love Verifiable’s positioning around the provider. They are the people between the healthcare system and the patient, so to have access to their data, patients can form a relationship with them, which is a powerful position.”</p>
<p>In addition to expanding into insurance payers, Macario intends to use the new funding to double his team of 26 employees by the end of the year. The company has openings for engineers, operations and go-to-market talent.</p>
<p>Verifiable works with companies like Lyra Health, Talkspace, Modern Health, Headway, Wheel, Quartet Health, Forward and provider networks to automate credentialing, compliance processes and provider operations.</p>
<p>“We have seen significant growth from customers and users over the past year,” Macario said. “We are making hundreds of thousands of unique verifications and will continue to double down on providers, use cases and payers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston go-to-market venture capital firm <a href="http://www.stage2.capital">Stage 2 Capital</a> kicks off its second fund with plans to invest $80 million into B2B software companies.</p>
<p>The firm’s approach combines venture capital expertise with a diverse community of over 250 limited partners and go-to-market experts who work with portfolio companies to accelerate revenue growth.</p>
<p>Firm co-founders Jay Po, a former investor at Bessemer Venture Partners, and Mark Roberge, former chief revenue officer at HubSpot, started Stage 2 Capital in 2018.</p>
<p>While at Bessemer, Po told TechCrunch he met startup founders who were not sure how to scale revenue or build a sustainable sales machine. He saw how big the skills gap was in go-to-market (GtM), so on nights and weekends he took classes on sales development to better understand what was going on.</p>
<p>At the same time, Roberge was on faculty at Harvard Business School and was consulting startups. He, too, saw founders struggle to build out their GtM function, so much so that gathered a bunch of data points and put them all together in a book, “The Sales Acceleration Formula: Using Data, Technology and Inbound Selling to go from $0 to $100 million.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186484" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186484" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png 3284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=1536,871 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=2048,1161 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186484" class="wp-caption-text">Stage 2 Capital team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stage 2 Capital</p></div></p>
<p>Po said the firm “was virtual before it was cool,” which is how it has been able to invest in diverse geographies and set its own pace in terms of curating its network and making introductions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their goal is to educate startups on the right time to scale. While startups should be growing 100% or 200%, many startups scale prematurely because they see certain companies experience massive growth all at once and assume that is the way to do it, Roberge said.</p>
<p>“We find companies jump into that set of goals prematurely and are not ready for it,” he added. “We help them to understand when and how fast they can go. They are often looking at that prior success, but are not appreciating the context, like who the other company was selling to and the environment at that time.”</p>
<p>Po and Roberge launched their first fund in 2018, raising $15 million, and ended up making 11 investments in late-seed stage to Series A companies and amassed a network of 97 LPs from companies like Gong, Procore, Atlassian, Asana and Drift. The firm wants to assist companies in changing the world, but Roberge said that will take a while, and that peers were impressed with the early signals of the investment thesis.</p>
<p>Investments from the first fund include companies hailing from across the United States, including Sendoso, Ocrolus, Gosite and Reibus.</p>
<p>“Stage 2 Capital stands out from all other VCs because of the expertise and partnership Jay, Mark and the LPs bring,” said Kris Rudeegraap, founder and CEO of Sendoso, in a written statement. “They’ve exceeded expectations on delivering what they promised and we’ve increased our revenue almost 10 times in the short time since they invested.”</p>
<p>The firm’s second fund represents a five-time increase in investment capital, Po said. He expects to be able to invest in another 20 companies with an average check size of $2 to $3 million. The pair have already made seven investments so far, including DeepScribe, Arcade, QuotaPath and Sales Impact Academy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based open banking bulk payment startup <a href="http://usecomma.com">Comma</a> has raised £4.34 million ($6m) in a Seed round of funding led by Octopus Ventures and Connect Ventures. They were joined by investors Village Global, and the founders of Wagestream, Peter Briffet and Portman Wills.</p>
<p>The company says it enables small and micro businesses to bulk pay bills, salaries, and taxes using existing high street small business bank accounts, saving them a lot of time and money in administration. This is because BACS is difficult to obtain and costly and virtual accounts require KYC to setup and add complexity to bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Comma says that during the pandemic, there was a large increase in outsourced financial operations. The availability of open banking bulk payment APIs from several of the High St banks made the product possible, which led to the startup picking up a great deal more business.</p>
<p>The Comma app connects to accounting systems (Xero, Quickbooks, Sage) and allows a business or their accountant to enter and manage supplier bank details without needing bank access. They can pay between 15 &#8211; 50 payees at once and the system posts payments against bills back to the accounting system to mark what has been paid.</p>
<p>Founder Tom Beckenham said: “I worked as COO of a business that was billing across continents and paying hundreds of staff. It was a very manual process. It occurred to me that larger businesses had corporate banking and systems that managed payments. Small businesses did not and were largely ignored. I noticed that traditional methods of solving the problem for small businesses had high setup costs &#8211; eliminating most of the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he saw an opportunity to use new open banking technology to get to this long tail of businesses and solve payments holistically: &#8220;We have just got past the £1,000,000 in payments so far. We will get to £1m per week by the end of the quarter.”</p>
<p>In the UK the startup competes to some extent with Credec, Telleroo, and BACS bureaus such as ADP. Internationally, Melio in the US is the closest comparison. Libeo in France is also offering something similar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past decade, Nigeria has seen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies cater to the development and growth of software engineers and tech talent in general. It&#8217;s a space many in the Nigerian ecosystem like to think is budding yet overcrowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chikanwobi">Chika Nwobi</a> started <a href="https://decagonhq.com/internationalfellowship/">Decagon</a> in 2018, the perception was generally &#8220;here comes another tech talent accelerator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years on, the entrepreneur who is a household name has significantly scaled the company to new heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Decagon is announcing its $1.5 million seed round and a student loan financing facility of $25 million from Nigerian financial institution Sterling Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a serial founder, Nwobi ran a couple of tech businesses, most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile internet company MTech in the early 2000s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With Decagon, Nwobi is charting new territory in the fast-paced startup world after years of investing via his seed-stage firm called L5Lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nwobi says Decagon aims to address the underrepresentation of black people in tech globally, starting with Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West African country is the most populous on the continent and the most populous black nation globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dire need for tech talent in Nigeria has become more evident these days, where startups are raising venture capital at a ridiculous pace. Youth unemployment in the country is at a staggering 50%, and while tech has presented an avenue to create jobs, supply isn&#8217;t catching up with demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more worrisome is the fact that the country&#8217;s best talents are leaving in droves to foreign companies in the U.S, Canada, the U.K., and Germany</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the issue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is supply. If supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is fixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, everyone is happy. That&#8217;s what Decagon hopes for by training and connecting engineers to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with both local and international companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Microsoft, Facebook and Google have all invested in building engineering offices in Nigeria, but most other companies can&#8217;t afford to do that, so we help them access top talent to work as remote engineers,” Nwobi said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon runs a six-month software engineering program and selects its candidates based on merit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a paid program, and the software engineers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay about N2 million (~$4,000) tuition to get in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the company employs an income-sharing model when the engineers find work and start earning upon graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if the trainees can not afford the program in the first place? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student loan financing takes care of that, and students who take that option are expected to repay N3 million (~$6,000) in the space of three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be the first to create such merit-based loan financing for students in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is in partnership with the financier Sterling Bank and Nigeria&#8217;s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows Decagon to offer a Pay-After-Learning plan that provides the trainees with laptops, accommodation, internet, meal allowance and a stipend. No upfront payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon says while more than 80,000 people have applied to partake in its program, it has accepted only 440 candidates. That&#8217;s a 0.55% acceptance rate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nwobi discloses three figures to show the company is on the right track: the company has recorded a 100% placement rate for its trainees, a 100% loan repayment rate, and a 410% salary increment made by its software engineers after getting placement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global tech talent company Andela employed this model before pivoting, and while it didn&#8217;t work for them, it seems to be working for Decagon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is likely because Andela used equity financing to carry out these operations, whereas Decagon uses debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obinna Ukachukwu, the divisional head of Sterling Bank, commenting on the student loan financing, said, “We got involved to support alternative education by providing loans for Nigerian students complemented with financial literacy training. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the excellent performance of the current portfolio, it made sense to scale our support to Decagon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its equity financing, Decagon raised money from Kepple Africa and Timon Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some angel investors like Paul Kokoricha, managing partner of the private equity business of ACA, and Tokyo-based UNITED Inc., also took part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nwobi says Decagon operates at the intersection of edtech, fintech and the future of work, and the funds will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its efforts on the three fronts. The company will also be looking to deepen gender inclusion by increasing female participation in its cohorts from 25% (its current stats) to 50% in the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds that the company which he refers to as a &#8220;tech talent catalyst&#8221; is profitable and growing at 500% per annum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We see this capital as fuel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our mission to transform exceptional people, often from under-represented backgrounds, into world-class engineers by connecting them with financing, in-demand skills and their dream jobs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re thrilled to work with Decagon to build up the top 0.5% of vetted engineering talent in Africa and help connect them to global tech opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The frequency of engineering leaders from US and European companies in our network ask about sourcing African and Nigerian technical talent has increased at a rapid clip, and we&#8217;re excited to lean into that and help Decagon on their mission,” partner at Timon Capital, Chris Muscarella, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon&#8217;s raise comes when there is general skepticism about the viability of tech talent accelerators on the continent despite their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Andela changed its model, it was a clear market leader with over $180 million in its arsenal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it’s pivot, funding has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stalled for most of these companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Decagon&#8217;s student loan financing method will be the new trendsetter in a space that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">desperately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs investment to solve Africa&#8217;s talent problem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Vedantu is not engaging to sell the firm to edtech giant Byju&#8217;s, a top executive said on Friday.</p>
<p>A report by Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/08/exclusive-byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-vedantu-for-800-mn/">said</a> early Friday that Byju&#8217;s had offered $700 million to $800 million to acquire Bangalore-based Vedantu, which counts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/indian-online-tutoring-platform-vedantu-raises-100-million/">Accel and GGV Capital among its investors</a>.</p>
<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch, Vedantu co-founder and chief executive Vamsi Krishna said any speculation around the firm engaging with Byju&#8217;s for an acquisition or merger is &#8220;absolutely 100% inaccurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s, which has acquired over half a dozen startups this year, declined to comment.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s most valuable startup, Byju&#8217;s, has held conversations with multiple education firms in recent quarters as the Bangalore-headquartered giant looks to expand its footprint and broaden its product offerings &#8212; by both organic and inorganic means.</p>
<p>The startup did reach out to both Unacademy and Vedantu last year and offered them both roughly $1 billion each, according to four people familiar with the matter. But Byju&#8217;s and Vedantu haven&#8217;t re-engaged this year, one of them said.</p>
<p>Vedantu is separately in advanced stages to close a new financing round that would value it at over $1 billion, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round is expected to close within weeks, they said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scores of young startups have cropped up in recent years to tap the education market in India, where more than 200 million individuals go to schools. Vedantu, Unacademy, and Byju&#8217;s lead the market and younger firms including Teachmint and Classplus have reported accelerate growth in recent quarters as more students adopt online learning platforms in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s K-12 education market is expected to grow 2.5x and expand to $120 billion by 2025, analysts at Bernstein said in a report to clients last week. &#8220;Online K-12 education is expected to grow 7x by 2025, reach $5 billion market driven by the strong growth in user base, increase in online penetration and expanding product offerings,&#8221; they wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 40 African startups from a handful of countries have gone through YC over the past decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Zambia joins that list today, and its entrant, <a href="https://union54.com/">Union54</a>, is a worthy first entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 (54 is a nod to the number of African countries) is a fintech company founded by Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. The startup claims to be Africa&#8217;s first card-issuing API and only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to paint the picture, Union54 didn&#8217;t come out of thin air; it is a project from the couple&#8217;s earlier startup Zazu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zazuafrica.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zazu </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 as a challenger bank in Zambia. As with any fintech on the continent, Zazu had to create its own debit cards that users could connect to a wallet. Most times, Zazu would have to wait months for partner banks in the country to issue these cards. Mlambo tells me that at one point they had to wait for 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this while the founders began to work with banks around the region to start issuing cards themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the banks were lethargic in their approaches. &#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> realized that either the processor or the bank was not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we&#8217;re looking for,&#8221; Mlambo said to TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup decided to go for the bullseye and meet with Mastercard. I mean, why wait for banks when you can bag those who issue these cards in the first place, right? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company got a Mastercard Principle membership, the first fintech from Africa, it claims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a principal member, Zazu became authorized to act as an &#8220;issuing bank.&#8221; In other words, they can provide debit cards and as &#8220;acquirers,&#8221; which means they can provide transaction processing services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, the founders realized that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span> really <span style="font-weight: 400;">advance African fintech, it was imperative to make it easier for any African country&#8217;s fintech to issue virtual or physical debit cards. So the team spun out Union54 from Zazu. The platform now has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> APIs that make it simple for any fintech to issue programmable debit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve now used our membership to be able to help other companies, any African fintech who wants to issue their own cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come to us, plug into our APIs, and move </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, without needing to spend a long time negotiating,&#8221; Mlambo said about providing the service for other African fintechs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds that the company targets fintechs that don&#8217;t want to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in setup fees </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get virtual or physical cards. Union54 claims to issue cards in weeks via an API that does BIN sponsorship, program management and settlement, among other features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to do this gives Union54 bragging rights as Africa&#8217;s first card-issuing API. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs have rarely looked at this opportunity; most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on other segments from payment gateways to wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an interesting point to note because somehow, all the big players in these segments end up trying to create virtual and physical cards for their customers and face complications doing so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s the void Union54 wants to fill, and although it&#8217;s currently in beta, the company boasts of an impressive unnamed clientele signed up on its wait list and currently using the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The fascinating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing about these companies is that they are not B or C players. They are in the top 5% of African fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for me, I always tell people, we&#8217;re now in the golden generation of African fintech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the perfect time for a card-issuing product to be able to work with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these guys considered leaders in their space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It means we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do have something that people want to use every day,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the company&#8217;s site, there are eight use cases for its API: ledger-based, acquirers/gateways, buy now, pay later, credit union, delivery companies, digital banking, credit card management and corporate cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs using Union54 are also allowed to design the cards and set the currency in which they want the cards to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and set an extensive catalog of who will use them, what they will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for, when they will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how they will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 charges fintechs on a pay-as-you-go basis for every API call. If a fintech company wants to create a physical card, they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a flat fee between $7-9 and an undisclosed flat fee when a transaction </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mlambo says getting into the summer batch of YC 2021 has allowed the company to sign up its first set of customers, as most of them have come from YC&#8217;s network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He calls YC a program that has been &#8220;worth it from day one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited and proud that Union54 has become the first Zambian fintech to get accepted into Y Combinator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the second in Southern Africa. As you will know, when global investors look at Africa, they often do so from a West African perspective and our getting into Y Combinator validates a small part of our broader hypothesis: it is possible to service Africa from friendly jurisdictions such as Zambia.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Micromobility startup Voi has raised $45 million, funds it says will be used to research and develop technology that will improve safety, keep users from riding on sidewalks and ensure scooters are properly parked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding comes a month after Voi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/the-station-rimac-bugatti-is-born-tesla-releases-fsd-beta-v9-and-ola-raises-500m/">launched a pilot</a> in Northhampton, UK with Irish startup Luna to test how computer vision technology might be used to solve parking and sidewalk riding issues. The R&amp;D spending will include &#8220;pioneering the use of computer vision software to prevent pavement riding,&#8221; according to a statement released by the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are leading the way in that technology – we want to embrace that technology, like Luna, to make available next year on our fleet for the masses,&#8221; a spokesperson for Voi told TechCrunch, who also noted the company is open outfitting its e-bikes with computer vision technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Voi spokesperson told TechCrunch the company is happy with the progress it’s made to date and is exploring its own proprietary technology, which could include acquiring Luna. No decisions or acquisitions have been made so far, but Voi is also investing in its next generation scooter. It’s possible that the next vehicle comes with computer vision built in, rather than retro-fitted to the stem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi, which already has scooters in 70 cities across the U.K. and Europe, is aiming to expand. And technology that solves parking, safety and sidewalk clutter is viewed by Voi as key to winning city partnerships and maintaining the ones it already has.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi is also using the funds to work on the sidewalk parking problem by adding physical parking racks. On Wednesday, Voi installed 100 parking racks in Stockholm in agreement with the city. Voi already has over 300 physical parking racks in the UK.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi uses a swappable battery system that’s popular with other operators like Lime and Spin, which means the racks are just there for keeping scooters out of the public right of way. Voi says having physical racks will help “create a sustainable service for cities and the people living in them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round brings Voi&#8217;s total funding to $205 million. The round was led by The Raine Group and existing investors like VNV Global participated alongside new investors. The company did not specify who those new investors are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Amsterdam garners the lion&#8217;s share of attention in the Netherlands tech ecosystem, the not-so-far-away region around Utrecht has its fair share of tech startups and investors, as is evidenced by our latest survey of locals, below.</p>
<p>Area ecosystem wranglers such as StartupUtrecht, UtrechtInc, Holland Startup, Utrecht Community and others bring startups, scaleups, corporates, angels, VCs, local government, banks and universities together to build the local startup ecosystem. They also benefit from the formidable Netherlands tech advocate initiative StartupDelta and The Netherlands Enterprise Agency, which promote the Netherlands more widely.</p>
<p>Utrecht is the fourth-largest city in the Netherlands, with 350,000 inhabitants. Its offices and co-working spaces include Dotslash Utrecht, De Stadstuin, MindSpace and Tribes; as well as accelerator programs like Startupbootcamp and Techleap.</p>
<p>Notable startups from the region include Distimo (acquired by AppAnnie), unicorn GitLab, MoneyMonk and StuComm. Plus there are newer ones such as SnappCar, Blendle, Merus, Nibblr, United Wardrobe, Näpp, Lalaland, 2DAYSMOOD and Remind2Change.</p>
<p>Our survey respondents think the ecosystem is strong in sustainable energy, medtech, food tech, life sciences, marketplaces, deep tech, gaming and media. However, they seem to think it’s weaker in design, hardware, fintech, robotics and agritech.</p>
<p>Notable startups named by our respondents include Channable, Pepscope, Goin&#8217; Connect, Fundsup, Tover, Faqta, Sensorfact, SODAQ, Picnic, Neurolytics, De Clique, Solease, BikeFlip, Packaly, DiManEx, Trunkrs, DialogueTrainer, EatMyRide, CART-Tech, Prolira, among many, many others. It just goes to show the region has a strong and growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The investment scene is described variously as focusing on software, clean tech, life sciences, biotech, organoids, 3D bioprinting, AI and VR/AR. One says: “In Amsterdam it&#8217;s ok. Utrecht is a bit lagging.” Another said, “The investor scene focuses on early-stage, scalable tech in healthcare, sustainability and education. [There are] many local informal investors and nationally operating VCs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the shift to remote working, many respondents think people will “preferably move out of the city center toward the villages nearby” as there is “a lot of nature/space around.” That said, Utrecht is “a growing hub” and many will “stay in the city. But fewer people will move in, and remote working is there to stay.” It’s also easy to work remotely in the Netherlands given its proximity to other big European cities, so it may attract new digital nomads, “thanks to the central position of Utrecht in the middle of the country and the attractiveness of the ecosystem.”</p>

We see an increase in startups coming to the city, due to livability in the lovely city and the facilities for flex working.</p>

<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
A lot of focus is on life sciences, biotech, as there is a lot of research at the Utrecht science park and also spin-offs. At the science park, organoids, 3D bioprinting, organ on a chip, medtech are areas of interest. Also a number of the VCs in the area are health focused. IT/software/data/AI and VR/AR are also important focus areas for investors.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
I think they will stay as Utrecht is very centrally located in the Netherlands and Europe. It’s easy to work remotely in the Netherlands, internet speed is no problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s apex court on Friday ruled in favor of Amazon to stall the sale of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">Future Group to Reliance Industries</a> in a major victory for the American e-commerce giant in the key overseas market &#8212; and a blow to the nation&#8217;s richest man Mukesh Ambani.</p>
<p>The Indian Supreme Court said the order by a Singapore arbitration court last year &#8212; which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">ruled to stall the deal between the two Indian giants</a> &#8212; is enforceable and legally binding in India.</p>
<p>The court order today is the latest setback for cash-starved Future Retail, which operates the nation&#8217;s second largest retail chain.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail, India&#8217;s largest retail chain, said a year ago it had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Things began to get complicated shortly. Amazon, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">invested in one of Future Group&#8217;s units</a> two years ago, accused the Indian firm of violating its contract and approached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal between the Indian firms.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal with Future Retail had given the American e-commerce giant the first right to refusal on purchase of more stakes in Future Retail, Amazon has argued.</p>
<p>The Indian firms, in return, argued last year that the Singapore’s court order wasn’t valid in the South Asian market. Moreover, India&#8217;s watchdog Competition Commission of India last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal</a> between the Indian firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, Reliance Industries said that its deal with Future Retail was fully enforceable under the Indian law and it intended to close the deal “without any delay.”</p>
<p>Shares of Future Retail, which operates 1,700 retail stores across 400 Indian cities, dropped 6% on the Friday order, while Reliance Industries &#8212; the conglomerate that runs Reliance Retail &#8212; were down 1.3%.</p>
<p>Amazon, Walmart’s Flipkart and Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the most valuable firm in India, are locked in an intense battle to command the Indian retail market.</p>
<p>With e-commerce commanding only between 3 -7% of all retail sales in India — and Reliance Retail launching its own e-commerce business to fight Amazon and Flipkart — Amazon’s reported future deal with Reliance Retail is already seen by many industry analysts as crucial for the American e-commerce firm’s future in India.</p>
<p>Amazon, which kickstarted its journey in India eight years ago, has invested more than $6.5 billion in its local business in the country.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Reliance Retail serves more than 3.5 million customers each week (as of early this year) through its nearly 12,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country.</p>
<p>The retail chain, run by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, raised over $7 billion last year. Ambani’s other venture, Jio Platforms, also raised over $20 billion from more than a dozen marquee investors, including Google and Facebook last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. electric automaker Fisker expects operating expenses to reach between $490 million and $530 million this year, a slight increase in its business outlook for the year that is driven by R&amp;D spending on prototypes for its Ocean SUV, testing and validation of advanced technology, hiring and its &#8220;accelerating&#8221; partnership with Foxconn.</p>
<p>The company, which reported its second-quarter earnings Thursday after market close, raised its business outlook for expectations for key non-GAAP operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year up from its previous guidance of $450 million to $510 million. The earnings report pointed to R&amp;D spending on prototype activities in 2021 driven by testing and validation on advanced driver assistance systems, powertrain and user interface. The company also noted an increase in spending on in-house costs, such as virtual validation software tools, hiring and virtual and physical testing to account for recently tightened Euro NCAP and IIHS safety regulations.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Co-founder, CFO and COO Geeta Gupta Fisker added during an investor call that the company </span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">made</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">strategic</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">decision</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">develop</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">internal</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">capabilities</span> to <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">test</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">validate,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">instead</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">relying</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">solely</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">third</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">parties.</span></p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Henrik Fisker said in an interview Thursday its partnership with Foxconn, which is &#8220;moving faster than expected,&#8221; also is contributing to an increase in spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really aligned,&#8221; Fisker said in an interview Thursday. &#8220;I mean it&#8217;s a very unique business deal because we are both investing into this program; it&#8217;s not like we just hired Foxconn to make a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fisker has two vehicle programs in the works. Its first electric vehicle, the Fisker Ocean SUV, will be assembled by automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Europe. The start of production is still on track to begin in November 2022, the company reiterated Thursday. Deliveries will begin in Europe and the United States in late 2022, with a plan to reach production capacity of more than 5,000 vehicles per month during 2023. Deliveries to customers in China are also expected to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>In May, Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Henrik Fisker said the two companies moved on the design &#8220;fairly quickly,&#8221; and are now diving into the engineering and technical details that include working on a patent for a new way of opening a trunk and other technological innovations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have accelerated really quite fast and we probably will have some early prototypes already by the end of this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The companies have also decided that this EV will be designed for the urban lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make a car for everybody,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t make a car for a farmer and for somebody who lives in an apartment; those are two different vehicles, so we chose the urban lifestyle for this vehicle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Production on the Project PEAR car, which stands for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution, will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India. Pre-production is expected begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023, and will then ramp up into the following year, Fisker said Thursday.</p>
<p>Henrik Fisker didn&#8217;t reveal the U.S. manufacturing location. He did make a recent visit to Foxconn&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Wisconsin, noting it was an &#8220;impressive&#8221; facility, as was the region&#8217;s supply chain. The final decision is Foxconn&#8217;s, Fisker noted. However, Fisker wants to produce the electric vehicle in a state that allows automakers to sell directly to customers. Wisconsin currently prohibits this practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be one of the main things that has to change for us to go to the store and sell our electric vehicle,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<h2>Earnings results</h2>
<p>Here are the basics from the company&#8217;s second-quarter earnings. Keep in mind two important factors: Fisker wasn&#8217;t publicly traded at this time last year, there are no year-over-year comparisons available yet; and this company is essentially pre-revenue, although they did bring in $27,000 from merchandise sales.</p>
<p>Fisker reported it generated $27,000 in revenue, a 22% bump up from the previous quarter. The automaker reported a net loss of $46.2 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss of $176.8 million in the previous quarter. That large net loss in the first quarter comes from changes in how the SEC treated non-cash items and resulted in warrants liability of $138 million in Q1. The public warrants are now retired and the company says will no longer have these impacts on future earnings.</p>
<p>Loss from operations were $53.1 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $33 million in the first quarter. Importantly, the company has held onto its cash using what it describes as an &#8220;asset light&#8221; approach, which means it&#8217;s not building a factory, instead relying on partners. Cash and cash equivalents were $962 million as of the quarter ended June 30, slightly lower than the $985.1 million in the first quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder, Best Buy committed to </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/a-note-from-best-buys-ceo-we-will-do-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“do better</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” when it came to supporting communities of color. As part of the retail giant’s self-proclaimed mission to better address underrepresentation and technology inequities, the company announced today that it is investing up to $10 million in </span><a href="https://brownventuregroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota-based Brown Venture Group is a three-year-old venture capital firm that has pledged to exclusively back Black, Latino and Indigenous technology startups in “emerging technologies.” Black and Latin communities were the recipients of</span><a href="http://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_crunchbase_diversity_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 2.6% of total funding in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group is in the process of fundraising for its </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-based-venture-capital-firm-for-founders-of-color-aims-to-raise-50-million/600011855/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted inaugural $50 million fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 75% of which has been committed, according to its principals. This means that Minneapolis-based Best Buy’s pledge to invest “up to $10 million” could represent as much as 20% of the total capital raised, making it a lead LP in the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group co-founder and managing partner Dr. Paul Campbell said that in the early days of forming the firm, he and co-founder Dr. Chris Brooks were told by “multiple people locally” that they should leave the Twin Cities metro area because “all the capital was on the coasts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just made a firm decision in the very early stages to stay put in the Twin Cities and that we wanted this to be a Twin City story,” Campbell told TechCrunch. “So when we thought about our Twin Cities ecosystem and who we wanted to be leading partners with, Best Buy was at the top of the list. So we are just more than excited to have Best Buy as a lead LP in our fund.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Best Buy &#8212; which </span><a href="https://fortune.com/company/best-buy/fortune500/#:~:text=As%20screen%20time%20soared%20in,%2C%20climbed%20a%20hefty%2016.7%25."><span style="font-weight: 400;">notched $47 billion in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year &#8212; said the move is aimed at helping “break down the systemic barriers often faced by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) entrepreneurs — including lack of access to funding — and empowering the next generation within the tech industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company added: “The partnership with Brown Venture Group will work toward making the technology startup landscape more inclusive and creating a stronger community of diverse suppliers.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with announcing Best Buy’s commitment to the fund, the company and venture firm said they would jointly launch an entrepreneurship program at Best Buy Teen Tech Centers to help develop young entrepreneurs through education, mentorship, networking and funding access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group &#8212; whose name was chosen to represent an &#8220;inclusive&#8221; skin color of the groups it represents &#8212; has so far invested in five companies, including clean energy startup </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brown-venture-group-to-provide-ecolution-kwh-with-seed-financing-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-for-transportation-301176317.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecolution kwh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten million dollars seems like a drop in the bucket for a company that generated sales of $47 billion last year. Best Buy said this initiative is just one of several that it has underway to support BIPOC businesses, including plans to </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-commits-more-than-44-million-to-diversity-inclusion-and-community-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide $44 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand college prep and career opportunities for BIPOC students and a pledge to spend at least </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-commits-to-spending-1-2b-with-bipoc-and-diverse-businesses-by-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The company has also said that by 2025 it will fill one out of three new non-hourly corporate positions with BIPOC employees and </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-sets-ambitious-goal-for-hiring-diverse-tech-talent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire 1,000 new employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its technology team, with 30% of them being diverse, specifically Black, Latinx, Indigenous and women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re committed to taking meaningful action to address the challenges faced by BIPOC entrepreneurs,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in a written statement. “Through partnerships like this, we believe we can begin to do this by helping to build a stronger, more vibrant community of diverse innovators in the tech industry, some of whom we hope will become partners of Best Buy in the future.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Extra Crunch for August 5, 2021. What goes up must come down. Mostly. That’s the lesson from Robinhood’s stock this week. It shot higher yesterday. And today it fell sharply. Something something stonks. Regardless, we have big news from Apple, Facebook, a host of startups and even some drones for you today.</p>
<p>A quick reminder that tomorrow is the last day for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/tomorrows-the-final-day-for-early-bird-passes-to-tc-disrupt-2021/">early-bird Disrupt tickets</a>. Be there or be a big lame! We’re also excited to announce that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! This Week in Apps by Sarah Perez launches this Saturday morning, August 7, and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness. Be sure to sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Apple to scan iPhones for abusive content involving children:</a> </strong>Apple’s privacy push is running into its efforts to limit the sharing of known child sexual abuse material. Its plan, that it has yet to roll out, will work at the device level to “identify if a user uploads known child abuse imagery to iCloud without decrypting the images until a threshold is met and a sequence of checks to verify the content are cleared.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">When a startup should leave a market:</a> </strong>In the wake of news that Deliveroo may leave the Spanish market, TechCrunch wanted to learn more about when a startup should leave a particular city or country to its competitors. So we rounded up some smart VCs and got to asking questions. The short answer is that you want gold and silver medals to build a unicorn, not bronze.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/oh-facebook-changed-its-privacy-settings-again/">Facebook redesigns its privacy settings:</a> </strong>And TechCrunch’s Devin Coldeway is not impressed, writing that Facebook has “taken the ‘privacy settings’ settings and scattered them mischievously among the other categories.” If you are a Facebook user, it’s always a good time to check your privacy setup on the social platform. It just may take a little longer now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a strong batch of startup stories below, but to kick things off have a bite of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/robotics-roundup-23/">the latest drone story from Brian Heater</a>. It’s rather tasty. Heater dug into the <em>warehouse</em> drone space, a somewhat natural environment for the tech as large storage buildings aren’t bothered by buzzy sounds, and often boxes in those buildings feature bar codes and are stacked vertically.</p>
<p>Now, our usual rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/"><strong>Quora launches subscriptions to access certain answers:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Creators who love answering questions, Quora would like your attention. Long-running Q&amp;A site Quora is rolling out Quora+ &#8212; natch &#8212; that will cost $5 per month, and allow access to content that creators decide should cost money to access.</li>
<li>When is a startup going to build the hub for all our subscriptions to digital content so that we can stop having to use password managers for everything? Someone build that, please.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/allocations-sees-a-world-where-myriad-smaller-private-equity-funds-are-the-norm/"><strong>Allocations raises $4M to power small PE funds:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This one is cool. Allocations has built tech that enables fund managers to quickly spin up new private equity funds and SPVs. And the startup’s tech handles boring things like paperwork and capital calls. The thesis here is that there will be many more smallish PE funds in the future. The solo GP movement indicates that Allocations might be barking up the correct money tree.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/astra-targets-first-commercial-orbital-launch-for-august-27/"><strong>Ad astra for Astra:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from space launch vehicle company Astra, which is targeting August 27 for its first commercial launch. Sure, Boeing is struggling to make its rocket go up, but seeing Astra chase better-known launch systems is good news. More competitors, more rockets in time. And then you and I can go to space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/plant-based-cereal-startup-offlimits-pours-2-3m-into-new-products/"><strong>OffLimits raises $2.3M for healthy cereal:</strong></a> Here in America we like our breakfasts sweet. That means our cereals are often loaded with sugar, and are thus both killing us while also making us smile. OffLimits is making cereal that is healthy (alas) but tasty, as well as &#8220;organic, vegan [and] gluten-free.” That sounds less fun than Cap’n Crunch, but as I’d like to avoid eventual limb amputation, perhaps the startup is onto something.</li>
<li>From the world of edtech, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">TechCrunch’s Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/as-edtech-evolves-latam-reskilling-platforms-raise-millions-to-bring-outcomes-into-the-mix/">big piece out today looking at two companies</a> &#8212; <strong>Coderhouse </strong>and<strong> Crehana</strong> &#8212; that are working in the reskilling space in Latin America. Reskilling, the teaching of new tricks to workers already in the market, is a big market. And Latin America is becoming a pretty key market for edtech, so make sure you don’t miss this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/cent-the-platform-that-jack-dorsey-used-to-sell-his-first-tweet-as-an-nft-raises-3m/"><strong>Cent raises 300,000,000 cents to help make sense of NFTs:</strong></a> Remember when @Jack sold his first tweet as an NFT? The platform that made that transaction possible just raised $3 million. Or as we noted before, 300 million cents. Regardless of how you prefer to write out monetary sums &#8212; 12,000,000 quarters! &#8212; the latest Cent deal indicates that VCs are still more than willing to bet on NFTs in particular, and the cryptoeconomy more broadly.</li>
</ul>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> covered a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/bluecore-lands-125m-series-e-on-1b-valuation-as-e-commerce-personalization-grows/">huge $125 million Series E for Bluecore</a> today. The new capital made the e-commerce personalization platform the world’s newest unicorn. At least for a few hours. I asked Miller why he covered the round. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bluecore is part of the omnichannel personalization market. It&#8217;s an area that thrived during the pandemic as more commerce shifted online and it became more imperative to offer more targeted messaging. The round is a sign that investors see the value in this and are willing to bet big money on companies like Bluecore being successful long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>There, a look behind the curtain!</p>
<h2>A blueprint for building a great startup founding team</h2>
<p>Assembling a startup&#8217;s team is harder than assembling 10 IKEA dressers and the stakes are much higher.</p>
<p>Starting with the assumption that 90% of startups will fail and the most successful ones take an average of six years to IPO, founders have to make careful decisions about who they invite to join the founding team.</p>
<p>Is a stellar engineer a great choice? Or a terrible choice? Should your product person be opinionated or a team player? Are you even the best choice for CEO?</p>
<p>ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair shared some of his thoughts about building a sturdy leadership team and drafted a thorough checklist for entrepreneurs who are putting a crew together. His initial advice?</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/twitter-spaces-cohosts/">Twitter Spaces adds co-hosting capabilities:</a> </strong>Now you can enlist your friends to help you manage your next live audio conversation on Twitter. Yes, Spaces, Big Tweet’s chatroom tool, is expanding its feature set. You can now have a host, two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers at once. Just don’t, because that would be more noise than signal.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/qualcomm-wants-to-buy-veoneer-for-4-6b-beating-magnas-offer/">Qualcomm wants to buy Veoneer:</a></strong> Qualcomm is offering $800 million more than what Magna International offered for Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer. The chip company is willing to cough up $4.6 billion for the asset. Why? Because Veoneer builds “advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software.” So consider this a long-term bet by Qualcomm that self-driving tech is going to be everywhere. Eventually.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/automakers-urge-greater-government-investment-to-meet-bidens-ev-sales-target/">Automakers want more government money:</a></strong> Cars are going electric, and the U.S. government has big goals to boost their domestic market share and production volume. Automakers are like, hey, how about some help. To that end a group of automotive OEMs are asking for the “timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration in the Build Back Better Plan.” That means money in the form of consumer incentives and a charging network.</li>
<li>Which feels a bit odd given that GM is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/gms-earnings-dragged-down-by-chevy-bolt-recall/">making oodles of money at the moment</a>. Surely it can deploy some of that capital? Also I hear that money is cheap at the moment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/googles-nest-cams-and-doorbell-get-a-refresh/">Google refreshes its Nest lineup:</a></strong> Finally for the day, Google’s Nest division has refreshes ready for its Nest lineup of cameras and doorbells. Nest is a bit of a dark horse inside of Google, given that it’s a hardware division at what is nearly entirely a software business. Still, the new hardware looks quite nice.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uber’s second-quarter earnings revealed greater than expected losses, in large part due to the company’s massive<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/"> $250 million stimulus package</a> launched in April to incentivize drivers back onto the app after a pandemic-induced shortage.</p>
<p>The company reported a loss of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-shares-fall-despite-revenue-beat-as-its-core-operations-continue-to-lose-money/">$509 million before EBITDA</a>. For comparison,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/"> Lyft reported a positive adjusted EBITDA</a> in the quarter at $23.8 million the day before. Uber&#8217;s losses point to a larger problem facing the app-based ride-hailing industry: The triple threat of lagging driver supply, the cost of attracting them, and the COVID-19 delta variant looming in the periphery.</p>
<p>“Drivers increasingly want to get back on the road,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi during the earnings call on Wednesday. “In June, 60% of inactive drivers told us they intended to start driving again within a month. That&#8217;s up from 40% in April. And 90% of drivers told us they expect to come back by September. We&#8217;re also beginning to see marketplace metrics revert to normalcy in several markets with surge levels and wait times back to nearly normal in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix. But in major cities like New York, San Francisco and LA, demand continues to outpace supply and prices in late times remain above our comfort levels.”</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said Uber is expecting the driver momentum that has been picking up over the last few months to continue, even as Uber tapers off its “post-pandemic” incentives for drivers. But the thing is, the pandemic is far from over. Only 50% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, and the CDC has said the highly contagious delta variant has caused between 80% and 87% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks of July. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/what-does-delta-variant-have-store-us-we-asked-coronavirus-experts">Many computer models predict</a> case counts will peak sometime between mid-August and early September, bringing as many as 450,000 daily cases.</p>
<p>Lockdowns haven’t been the only things causing driver shortages: Drivers don’t want to risk their lives during a pandemic for what is often argued to be meager pay. Uber’s losses and attempts to attract more drivers also come as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/">is back on stage as a potential threat to gig workers’ labor rights.</a> Uber is part of a coalition of app-based ride-hailing and on-demand delivery companies that filed a petition this week to introduce a ballot measure in Massachusetts that would define drivers as independent contractors, not employees — similar to what happened last year in California with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/"> Proposition 22</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the incentives that they used to get people back, and I think most drivers that have any brains did the same,&#8221; an Uber driver called Jay who&#8217;s been driving since 2013 told TechCrunch. &#8220;And once the incentives ran out, I stopped driving, because I&#8217;m losing money when I drive for them now. They have cut the rates so low that it doesn&#8217;t make any sense anymore to work for them, and that&#8217;s why people are having such a hard time getting an Uber. You have these disgustingly out of touch billionaires running this company into the ground.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Khosrowshahi — presumably one of the “out of touch billionaires” Jay references — went on to assure investors that Uber expects to achieve total company EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. Uber is hoping its investments in what it calls the “earner experience” will help retain workers.</p>
<p>“From doubling down on our app quality to targeted and personalized reengagement campaigns, to completely redesigning our onboarding flow to make it easier and faster than ever to earn safely, to rolling out unique programs like free language learning from Rosetta Stone, or free tuition with ASU, our earner super app is unique in the depth and breadth of earnings opportunities we can offer drivers and couriers globally,” he said.</p>
<p>If mobility continues to take a hit, as it has recently in cities like Sydney, Australia due to persistent lockdowns, Khosrowshahi says Uber can fall back on its other businesses, like freight, Uber Eats and courier service. Khosrowshahi said there&#8217;s been a trend of Uber Eats and courier orders increasing as rides decrease.</p>
<p>Last November,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/"> Uber acquired online food delivery app Postmates</a>, which the company says has resulted in nearly 5 million additional consumers, 160,000 couriers and over 25,000 merchants migrating from Postmates to Uber Eats, as well as helping Uber establish itself as a category leader in Los Angeles and New York City.</p>
<p>Uber has also expanded into new verticals recently like grocery, convenience and alcohol delivery, with U.S. gross bookings in June nearly tripling from December 2020 levels and doubling in the U.K. and France.</p>
<p>“The differentiator that we have is the audience and the Uber platform,” said Khosrowshahi. “We were actually one of the latest players to build up a delivery business, and we built it based on the Uber brand, the marketplace-matching technology that we have, the pricing technology, routing, etc. [ … ] We’ve got bigger datasets than anyone else. We&#8217;re able to train our algorithms over much larger global data points versus our competitors, which allow us to build a matching, routing, incentives, marketing engine that is more personalized and just has greater capabilities than anyone else.”</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi also noted that the company has ops teams on the ground in every market so it can understand the right inventory per marketplace.</p>
<p>“It all translates into: Lower cost of customer acquisition, higher lifetime value, lower overheads and greater tech capabilities. That&#8217;s the differentiator.”</p>
<p>Aside from hitting its EBITDA goals by Q4, Khosrowshahi said Uber expects total company gross bookings to be between $22 and $24 billion, and total company adjusted EBITDA to be better than a loss of $100 million for Q3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo, best known for its whimsical owl and language-learning app, is working on a new product to add to its growing suite: a math app, according to CEO Luis von Ahn. The co-founder mentioned the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/">during an interview last week</a>, the same day that Duolingo officially listed in the stock market.</p>
<p>After the interview, TechCrunch reached out to Duolingo to get more information about the app, but the company declined to provide more detail because it is “still very early” in the development process. It did say that users may learn more about it later this month at <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/duocon">Duocon</a>, Duolingo’s annual free conference. A May job posting shows that Duolingo has been looking for a <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/duolingo/jobs/5243613002">learning scientist </a>with a PhD in mathematics to help build out a new math app alongside a “small cross-functional team.”</p>
<p>The listing hints that the app will be focused on serving younger learners. It mentions that Duolingo wants candidates to have classroom experience and knowledge about teaching K-12 level math, especially with younger students between 3rd and 8th grade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths">Duolingo&#8217;s current users feel mixed</a> about the idea of Duolingo getting into math.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/embed/#?secret=WBgWuLCuwL" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an interview on IPO day, CEO Luis von Ahn said that users may see Duolingo accelerate its math app and that the company plans to expand beyond language learning through upcoming acquisitions. That may calm some qualms around Duolingo needing to put a ton of resources toward an entirely new piece of software or curriculum.</p>
<p>“If there are other subjects where we think somebody is doing a pretty good job and they have a similar mission to us, and they have a similar company culture,” Duolingo may consider acquiring the company, von Ahn said in the interview.</p>
<p>Math-focused edtech companies include Khan Academy, <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant.org</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/math-learning-app-photomath-raises-23-million-as-it-reaches-220-million-downloads/"> Photomath</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/">Numerade</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">the recently acquired Symbolab. </a></p>
<p>For Duolingo, the math app is another chapter in its history of experimentation. The company has churned through hundreds of ideas in its decade of existence, which have had varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, it built a product suite beyond its core app, which includes Duolingo ABC, a literacy app for kids and the Duolingo English Test. Meanwhile, Duolingo’s “graveyard” of failed ideas includes a few retired monetization strategies and AI-powered chatbots. Popular features like leaderboards sputtered before they succeeded. And math, interestingly, has always been in the back of von Ahn’s head.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">As mentioned in the Duolingo EC-1</a>, von Ahn has always said that he and his co-founder, Severin Hacker, were thinking about making Duolingo a math app before they eventually decided on language learning.</p>
<p>“I love math, but if you learn math, math itself can’t make you any money,” von Ahn said in a previous interview. “You learn math to learn physics to become an engineer, whereas knowledge of English directly improves your income potential in most countries of the world.”</p>
<p>One user<a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths"> wrote that</a> “[math] is such a key skill to learn…[and] hopefully this may provide better resources especially to those with such limited access, while being inspirational and equally engaging to those of us with more opportunities.”</p>
<p>Others seemed to want Duolingo to invest inwardly on its language-learning service before moving outward to other areas. “It&#8217;s odd that Duo should consider branching into Maths when its coverage of the majority of languages (with the notable exception of French and Spanish) leaves a great deal to be desired,” <a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031?comment_id=49113260">one user wrote. </a></p>
<p>The company can only teach from a beginner to a low-intermediate level of language fluency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). About 30% to 40% of Duolingo courses are in some stage of CEFR alignment, per the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">company’s last pull of metrics</a> from May.</p>
<p>It may be too soon to assume how Duolingo’s math app would look, what it would offer or even if it will be monetized. Regardless, it will be Duolingo’s first formal foray into an area of education beyond language.</p>
<p>The company will need to find not only the product, but the philosophical overlap between the two subjects. Language learning is a skill that is benefited by cultural context and nuance, while math revolves around the goal of getting to the one right answer. However, both areas of education require methodical thinking and the ability to apply functions to get to answers. Ultimately, both rely on what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo often argues is its biggest product</a>: motivation to open up an app, and pay attention to what’s happening on the screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ward van Gasteren embraces the “growth hacker” term, despite the fact that some in the profession prefer the term “growth marketing” or simply “growth.” What’s the difference to him? The hacking part should be a distinct effort on top of ongoing marketing, he says.</p>
<p>“Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work,” he tells us. “Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant.”</p>
<p>Based in The Netherlands, he has developed his own growth hacking courses, <a href="https://growwithward.com/">Grow With Ward</a>, and worked with large companies like TikTok, Pepsi and Cisco, and startups like Cyclemasters, Somnox and Zigzag. In the conversation below, van Gasteren shares the importance of building internal processes around growth for the long term, the state of growth today and his own development.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>You’re a certified growth hacker &#8212; how do you think this sets you apart from others? How has this certification changed the way you approach working with clients?</strong></p>
<p>I was part of the first-ever class from Growth Tribe (when they still offered multimonth traineeships), which was an amazing experience. The difference that a certification shows is that you know that a certified growth hacker has knowledge of the beginning-to-end process of growth hacking, and that this person is supposed to look at more than just a single experiment to hack their growth.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cowboy growth hackers who simply repeat the same tactics, instead of trying to work from a repeatable process, where you identify problems through data, have a non-biased prioritization process for ideas and will focus on long-term learnings over direct impact. A proper certificate shows that you know what it takes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>When do you think clients should invest in the beginner growth hacking course you offer on your website rather than investing in working with you directly? </strong></p>
<p>I created the course to make growth hacking available to a larger audience. I noticed that almost all other growth hacking courses fell into one of two buckets: (1) cheap (&lt;$200), but focused on superficial growth tactics, or (2) good quality in-depth content, but very expensive ($1,500-$5,000). And I believe everybody should have access to that knowledge of how to build a systematic process to achieve long-term sustainable growth, so I created my own course, since I know that working one-on-one with me is also too expensive for most people.</p>
<p>Especially if you’d look at students or junior marketeers, for whom I created a proper beginner growth hacking course that will teach you 20% of the knowledge that is necessary to achieve the first 80% of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Growth hacking does have some noticeable differences from marketing, as outlined on your <a href="https://growwithward.com/what-is-growth-hacking/">website</a>. How should clients make the decision between working with you, a growth hacker, instead of with a marketer? </strong></p>
<p>The choice between working with a growth hacker versus a digital marketer is not a one-or-the-other choice; the fields are very different in focus and actually complementary to each other. Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work. Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant. You shouldn’t hire a growth hacker to maintain your marketing strategies; they’re excited to make new growth steps and would get bored when they can’t test new ideas.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I help a client get up to speed, show which opportunities are valuable and give them a strategy to execute. Then I hand it over to marketing for the long-term execution and coach them on the execution, and step back in when there’s a need for new growth input.</p>
<p><strong>What are some common misconceptions about growth hacking? </strong></p>
<p>A lot of growth hackers still present growth hacking as a perfect approach, where thanks to our data-driven way of working we can always make the right moves. But that’s not true: The hard data that you see in your analytics tools, can only tell you what is slowing down your growth, but not why your growth slows down there. While the &#8220;why&#8221; is what we build our experiments on top of … many growth hackers just fill that with their own assumptions to keep their speed, but that’s not sustainable long term.</p>
<p>Next to the hard data, you need soft data: the why. And that comes from talking with customers, running hypothesis-focused experiments (not result-focused) and maybe by looking at your feedback from customer support or surveys. Every time I implement a soft data feedback loop with my clients, I see that we increase our experiment effectiveness from 1 in 10 up to 1 in 3.</p>
<p><strong>What trends are you seeing in the growth hacking world right now? </strong></p>
<p>The growth industry is definitely maturing. Less hacks, more teams, more focus on velocity. Everybody within the field is getting to know the best practices very quickly and implementing them even quicker. So then what? We need more knowledge, more qualitative feedback and a more systematic approach to scale up our impact, to be able to rise above best practices and implement truly relevant and sophisticated tactics for our businesses. Since the field is maturing, you see people starting to get rid of the shoestring tools.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m currently rolling out a growth management tool for growth teams, called Upgrow, where teams can more easily manage their experiment velocity, report to stakeholders with the click of a button and make sure that they systemize the knowledge retention from their articles to build companywide knowledge. And you see that mature growth teams need this kind of software to really level up and manage these trends that are putting stress on their process due to the growth of their company.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong? </strong></p>
<p>Most startups just keep perfecting their product forever-and-ever: “Just this one extra feature and then we go live.” I can understand that, since north-star metrics, NPS scores and product-led growth are dominating the conversation around startup growth nowadays, but let me be real: You will never be fully done. There will always be a next feature. And you will only have a benefit if you grow alongside your customers. Put a &#8220;coming soon&#8221; on your website for the features that are in the making, and just start selling and scaling up your growth efforts: Different channels bring different kinds of users, who will have new demands, so you have to be adapting all the time. Not just now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple later this year will roll out new tools that will warn children and parents if the child sends or receives sexually explicit photos through the Messages app. The feature is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">a handful of new technologies Apple is introducing</a> that aim to limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) across Apple&#8217;s platforms and services.</p>
<p>As part of these developments, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">will be able to detec</a>t known CSAM images on its mobile devices, like iPhone and iPad, and in photos uploaded to iCloud, while still respecting consumer privacy.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature, meanwhile, is meant to enable parents to play a more active and informed role when it comes to helping their children learn to navigate online communication. Through a software update rolling out later this year, Messages will be able to use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo being shared is sexually explicit. This technology does not require Apple to access or read the child&#8217;s private communications, as all the processing happens on the device. Nothing is passed back to Apple&#8217;s servers in the cloud.</p>
<p>If a sensitive photo is discovered in a message thread, the image will be blocked and a label will appear below the photo that states, &#8220;this may be sensitive&#8221; with a link to click to view the photo. If the child chooses to view the photo, another screen appears with more information. Here, a message informs the child that sensitive photos and videos &#8220;show the private body parts that you cover with bathing suits&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also suggests that the person in the photo or video may not want it to be seen and it could have been shared without their knowing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png 2046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>These warnings aim to help guide the child to make the right decision by choosing not to view the content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, if the child clicks through to view the photo anyway, they&#8217;ll then be shown an additional screen that informs them that if they choose to view the photo, their parents will be notified. The screen also explains that their parents want them to be safe and suggests that the child talk to someone if they feel pressured. It offers a link to more resources for getting help, as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still an option at the bottom of the screen to view the photo, but again, it&#8217;s not the default choice. Instead, the screen is designed in a way where the option to <em>not</em> view the photo is highlighted.</p>
<p>These types of features could help protect children from sexual predators, not only by introducing technology that interrupts the communications and offers advice and resources, but also because the system will alert parents. In many cases where a child is hurt by a predator, parents <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/katies-apps-piece/289-d399ac48-f052-4378-bfd3-4589a83e9632">didn&#8217;t even realize</a> the child had begun to talk to that person online or by phone. This is because <a href="https://www.bark.us/blog/grooming-signs-sexual-predators/">child predators are very manipulative</a> and will attempt to gain the child&#8217;s trust, then isolate the child from their parents so they&#8217;ll keep the communications a secret. In other cases, the predators <a href="https://www.sexualassaultvictimlawyers.com/the-grooming-process-how-sexual-predators-con-you-and-your-child/">have groomed the parents</a>, too.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s technology could help in both cases by intervening, identifying and alerting to explicit materials being shared.</p>
<p>However, a growing amount of CSAM material is what&#8217;s known as self-generated CSAM, or imagery that is taken by the child, which may be then shared consensually with the child&#8217;s partner or peers. In other words, sexting or sharing &#8220;nudes.&#8221; According to a 2019 <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/7145355/Research/08112020_SG-CSAM_AttitudesExperiences-Report_2019.pdf?__hstc=208625165.d727c87a690279499c0437f031133788.1607630830912.1608068247513.1608130036388.3&amp;__hssc=208625165.2.1608130036388&amp;__hsfp=4238489979">survey </a>from Thorn, a company developing technology to fight the sexual exploitation of children, this practice has become so common that 1 in 5 girls ages 13 to 17 said they have shared their own nudes, and 1 in 10 boys have done the same. But the child may not fully understand how sharing that imagery puts them at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature will offer a similar set of protections here, too. In this case, if a child attempts to send an explicit photo, they&#8217;ll be warned before the photo is sent. Parents can also receive a message if the child chooses to send the photo anyway.</p>
<p>Apple says the new technology will arrive as part of a software update later this year to accounts set up as families in iCloud for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey in the U.S.</p>
<p>This update will also include updates to Siri and Search that will offer expanded guidance and resources to help children and parents stay safe online and get help in unsafe situations. For example, users will be able to ask Siri how to report CSAM or child exploitation. Siri and Search will also intervene when users search for queries related to CSAM to explain that the topic is harmful and provide resources to get help.</p>
