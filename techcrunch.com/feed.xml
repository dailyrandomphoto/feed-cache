										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s still a bit of a legal maze, but more cities are <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/06/30/its-now-legal-for-home-chefs-in-california-to-sell-meals-will-more-cities-get-on-board/">coming around to the idea</a> of letting local home chefs bring in more income by selling homecooked meals to those nearby.</p>
<p><a href="https://shef.com">Shef</a> is a marketplace meant to help these home chefs connect with customers, handle orders, and get the food delivered — and they&#8217;ve just raised $20M to get it done.</p>
<p>The company is announcing its Series A round this morning, led by Andreessen Horowitz and backed by Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, M13, and a bevy of celebrities including Padma Lakshmi, Chef Aarón Sánchez, Katy Perry, Tiffany Haddish, Orlando Bloom, and NBA All-Star Andre Iguodala.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the round, Andreessen Horowitz GP (and former OpenTable CEO) Jeff Jordan will join Shef&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Because of varying local laws, Shef works a bit differently from market to market. In some places, for example, they&#8217;re able to tap local delivery networks to get meals the last mile; in others, chefs handle deliveries themselves.</p>
<p>Across all markets, though, the ordering process boils down to: pick a chef, order what you want a few days in advance (everything is done via pre-orders so chefs know exactly what they&#8217;ll need each day — it&#8217;s not an on-a-whim kind of thing), then heat it up upon arrival.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160326" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160326" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png" alt="" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=2048,1111 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shef</p></div></p>
<p>But whether or not a service like this is even allowed to <em>exist</em> varies from place to place. Even in California where a relatively new statewide law allows home cooks to sell their goods, the final say (and the details of the implementation) <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/17/685626391/selling-food-from-your-kitchen-is-legal-in-california-but-theres-a-catch">comes down to each county</a>. In many places, &#8220;homecooking&#8221; still requires getting access to a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>Shef co-founders Alvin Salehi and Joey Grassia don&#8217;t shy away from the legal challenges — in a chat earlier this week, they told me that they expect much of the funds they raised to go toward two things: figuring out how to get services like theirs legalized in more markets (they&#8217;ve hired Danielle Merida, former General Counsel for TaskRabbit, to help there), and to onboard chefs as those new markets come online.</p>
<p>The company says they currently have over 12,000 home chefs on their wait list, with that number ballooning as the pandemic shuttered restaurants around the country. Each chef they bring on to the platform goes through a 150-step onboarding process, including a food safety certification exam and food quality assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to expand the services to as many people as possible, because so many people need it,&#8221; Salehi tells me. &#8220;But it takes resources to be able to do that effectively, and most importantly, to do that safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shef is currently live in the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Seattle, and New York, with plans to roll out in new markets&#8230; well, as soon as they can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook said it&#8217;s preparing to launch a new application programming interface (API) designed specifically for access by the research community. The API was announced during Facebook&#8217;s F8 developer conference today, and is meant to address issues that arose from changes made to Facebook&#8217;s platform in 2018 following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. That event forced the company to re-evaluate the access developers had to its user data.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Facebook says it has deprecated thousands of APIs to reduce the risk of future data misuse and breaches.</p>
<p>It also renewed its agreements with developers on the platform to ensure they were &#8220;committed to the same values as we are,&#8221; noted Facebook VP of platform partnerships, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, during the keynote address.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, Facebook admitted these changes had an impact on the academic research community, which had before been able to more broadly access Facebook data.</p>
<p>To address this, the company announced it&#8217;s soon launching a Researcher API, which will allow researchers to again analyze Facebook data with the goal of understanding the social network&#8217;s &#8220;influence on society,&#8221; Papamiltiadis noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to make sure we got this right, and we were intentional about developing the best products to support researchers, while keeping people&#8217;s data safe and secure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Researcher API will offer real-time access to public Pages, Groups, Events and post-level U.S. data in a privacy-protected environment, the exec said. But further details were not offered, including, for example, how researchers would be vetted or whether there would be any fees associated with the data access.</p>
<p>The API will become available to the academic community later this year, Facebook said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seven days, 168 hours or 10,080 minutes — no matter how you count it, there’s just one week left until the global mobility tech community gathers on June 9 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. If you’re one of the brilliant minds focused on changing the future of transportation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">grab your pass</a> and join your tribe of revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Whether you’re into AI, AVs, EVs, robotics (not everything’s an acronym around here) or hunting potential unicorns, you’ll gain insight from the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true"> leading voices in mobility</a>. We packed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">the event agenda</a> with an exciting variety of interactive presentations, panel discussions and breakout sessions. Bring your questions and join the conversation.</p>
<p>Here’s a peek at just some of the topics and people you can enjoy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision:</strong> Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar-sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</p>
<p><strong>Innovating Future Mobility for Global Scale:</strong> Learn how the California Mobility Center’s (CMC) model of bringing its clients’ new technologies to market is new and innovative, going beyond a typical demonstration or pilot program, to the point of product launch and sustaining market viability. Hear from an expert panel about how the CMC’s programming is unique, innovative, and game-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Building an Electric Powerhouse:</strong> Rimac Automobili, today known for its electric hypercars and battery and powertrain development, began like so many storied startups do — in a garage. Mate Rimac has taken his company from tiny upstart to a 1,000-person company that has attracted Porsche as an investor and customer. And more is coming. We’ll talk to Mate about building a startup, his views on the EVs, and what is next for the company.</p>
<p>Don’t stress out about missing out — this is a no FOMO situation. Your pass includes live streaming and VOD access. That kind of flexibility lets you attend live and still get some work done at your desk. VOD lets you tap into any of the sessions you miss.</p>
<p>But don’t miss out on the 30 game-changing mobility startups showcasing their tech and talent in the expo area. Visit their virtual booths, ask for a demo, or strike up a collaboration. You’ll also get a chance to see them pitch during the Startup Pitch Feedback Session (listed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/#878941bf-c22c-4ec4-ab2f-d8c0c15cb8ae">the agenda</a>). Those feedback sessions can help you hone your own pitch, so check it out and take notes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DevOps platform GitLab today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://unreview.io/">UnReview</a>, a machine learning-based tool that helps software teams recommend the best reviewers for when developers want to check in their latest code. GitLab, which is looking to bring more of these machine learning capabilities to its platform, will integrate UnReview&#8217;s capabilities into its own <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/code-review/">code review workflow</a>. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we decided that the future of DevOps includes ML/AI, both within the DevOps lifecycle as well as the growth of adoption of ML/AI with our customers,&#8221; David DeSanto, GitLab&#8217;s senior director, Product Management &#8211; Dev &amp; Sec, told me. He noted that when GitLab recently surveyed its customers, 75% of the teams said they are already using AI/ML. The company started by adding a bot to the platform that can automatically label issues, which then led to the team meeting with UnReview and, finally, acquiring it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159839" style="width: 844px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159839" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png" alt="" width="834" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png 834w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=680,488 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2159839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GitLab</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our primary focus for the second half of this year in bringing on UnReview is to help automate the selection of code reviewers. It&#8217;s a very interesting problem to solve, even we at GitLab occasionally end up picking the wrong reviewers based off of what people know,&#8221; DeSanto noted.</p>
<p>GitLab launched its original code review components last year. As Wayne Haber, GitLab&#8217;s director of Engineering, noted, that was still a very manual process. Even with the new system, teams still retain full control over which reviewers will be assigned to a merge request, but the tool will automatically &#8212; and transparently &#8212; rank potential reviewers based on who the system believes is best suited to this task.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the opportunity to share my passion for data science and machine learning with <span class="il">GitLab</span> and its community,&#8221; said <span class="il">Alexander Chueshev, </span>UnReview&#8217;s founder (and now a senior full stack engineer at <span class="il">GitLab)</span>. &#8220;I look forward to enhancing the user experience by playing a role in integrating UnReview into the <span class="il">GitLab</span> platform and extending machine learning and artificial intelligence into additional DevOps stages in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeSanto noted that GitLab now has quite a bit of experience in acquiring companies and integrating them into its stack. &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking to acquire strong teams and strong concepts that can help accelerate our roadmap or strategy or help the platform in general,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And you can see it over the last couple of years of acquisitions. When we were looking at extending what we did in security, we acquired two leaders in the security space to help build that portfolio out. And that&#8217;s fully integrated today. [&#8230;] In the case of this, UnReview is doing something that we thought we may need to do in the future. They had already built it, they were able to show the value of it, and it became a good partnership between the two companies, which then led to this acquisition.&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle here is that GitLab offers both a hosted SaaS service and allows users to run their own on-premises systems as well. Running an ML service like UnReview on-premises isn&#8217;t necessarily something that most businesses are equipped to do, so at first, UnReview will be integrated with the SaaS service. The team is still looking at how to best bring it to its self-hosted user base, including a hybrid model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://iterative.ai/">Iterative</a>, an open-source startup that is building an enterprise AI platform to help companies operationalize their models, today announced that it has raised a $20 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.468cap.com/">468 Capital</a> and Mesosphere co-founder Florian Leibert. Previous investors <a href="https://trueventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trueventures.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622675286816000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZJFMaSx7Twdz3oGntzNwOf5GPeQ">True Ventures</a> and <a href="https://afore.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://afore.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622675286816000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRkWkRZGGSlD3qdLGZRryM7uUVwQ">Afore Capital</a> also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $25 million.</p>
<p>The core idea behind Iterative is to provide data scientists and data engineers with a platform that closely resembles a modern GitOps-driven development stack.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xM5az78Lrg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=6&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After spending time in academia, Iterative co-founder and CEO Dmitry Petrov joined Microsoft as a data scientist on the Bing team in 2013. He noted that the industry has changed quite a bit since then. While early on, the questions were about how to build machine learning models, today the problem is how to build predictable processes around machine learning, especially in large organizations with sizable teams. &#8220;How can we make the team productive not the person? This is a new challenge for the entire industry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Big companies (like Microsoft) were able to build their own proprietary tooling and processes to build their AI operations, Petrov noted, but that&#8217;s not an option for smaller companies.</p>
<p>Currently, Iterative&#8217;s stack consists of a couple of different components that sit on top of tools like GitLab and GitHub. These include <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> for running experiments and data and model versioning, <a href="https://cml.dev/">CML</a>, the company&#8217;s CI/CD platform for machine learning, and the company&#8217;s newest product, <a href="https://studio.iterative.ai/">Studio</a>, its SaaS platform for enabling collaboration between teams. Instead of reinventing the wheel, Iterative essentially provides data scientists who already use GitHub or GitLab to collaborate on their source code with a tool like DVC Studio that extends this to help them collaborate on data and metrics, too.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“DVC Studio enables machine learning developers to run hundreds of experiments with full transparency, giving other developers in the organization the ability to collaborate fully in the process,” said Dmitry Petrov, CEO and founder of Iterative. “The funding today will help us bring more innovative products and services into our ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Petrov stressed that he wants to build an ecosystem of tools, not a monolithic platform. When the company closed this current funding round about three months ago, Iterative had about 30 employees, many of which were previously active in the open-source community around its projects. Today, that number is already closer to 60.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data, ML and AI are becoming an essential part of the industry and IT infrastructure,” said Leibert, general partner at 468 Capital. “Companies with great open source adoption and bottom-up market strategy, like Iterative, are going to define the standards for AI tools and processes around building ML models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">F8 Refresh, Facebook&#8217;s annual developer conference with a new twist &#8212; it&#8217;s more pared down than in years past, and virtual &#8212; is going to be kicking off later today, and ahead of that Facebook is unveiling some news: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all businesses</a> can now use the Messenger API to interact with users on Instagram. The feature is opening first to all developers globally, with a phased approach for businesses:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 1 will see Instagram accounts with follower counts of over 10,000 and under 100,000 connect to the API. It plans to expand that to accounts with followers numbering between 1,000 and 100,000 in July (phase 2), with remaining accounts coming online by Q3.</p>
<p>The feature was first announced as a closed beta in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/facebook-introduces-a-new-messenger-api-with-support-for-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October</a> with select businesses &#8212; 30 developers and 700 brands in all. Now, any brand or organization using Instagram to interact with customers can use it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The key point with this tool is that this integration represents a significant step forward in how companies can leverage the wider Facebook platform.</p>
<p>In the past, a brand that wanted to interact with customers either needed to do so directly through Instagram, or via Facebook&#8217;s unified business inbox, which are limited how they can be used, especially by companies that might be handling large volumes of traffic, or keen to be able to link up those customer interactions with wider customer service databases.</p>
<p>The Messenger API, by contrast, can be integrated into any third-party application that a company or brand might be using to manage communication, whether it&#8217;s a social media management platform like Hootsuite or Sprinklr, or a CRM application that can bring in other kinds of customer data, for example warranty information or loyalty card numbers.</p>
<p>Facebook noted that one of the key takeaways from the closed beta was that brands and companies wanted better ways of managing communications from one place; and another was that many of them are making more investments in software to better manage their communications and workflows. So extending the Messenger API to Instagram was a feature that was long needed in that regard.</p>
<p>The move to expand the Messenger API to Instagram makes sense in a couple of different ways. For starters, Facebook has been turning up the volume for some time on how it leverages Instagram&#8217;s commercial potential, starting with advertising but expanding into areas like conversation between brands or businesses and users, and most recently, enhanced shopping features. Facebook also notes that 90% of Instagram users today follow at least one business, so creating a better route for managing those conversations is a logical move.</p>
<p>At the same time, Facebook has been working on ways of better linking up its various apps and platforms &#8212; which include Facebook itself, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, not just for users to interact across them but to help businesses leverage them in a more unified social strategy. Rolling out the Messenger API &#8212; created originally to help brands interact with bots and manage conversations on Messenger &#8212; to include support for Instagram fits into both of those bigger strategies.</p>
<p>And for those wondering why it&#8217;s being announced ahead of F8 Refresh? Perhaps it&#8217;s a hint of what is the social network&#8217;s bigger priorities for this year&#8217;s event: partnerships to enable more business to take place on the social networking giant&#8217;s platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been hearing a lot about International Entrepreneur Parole lately. I’m wondering if both my co-founder, who is currently on an H-1B that we’re in the process of transferring to our startup, and an employee on STEM OPT, who we’re making a co-founder, would be eligible to apply. How does parole work and how long does it take? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Also, we are close to securing $200,000 in investments. Do we have to raise another $50,000 to sponsor someone for parole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Looking for Answers in Los Altos</strong></p>
<p>Dear Looking,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to me with your <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) questions! What makes IEP so exciting is its flexibility: Up to three co-founders of a startup can self-petition for IEP, which means they don’t need an employer sponsor. Unlike an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> or another work visa, this is great because the applicant can be the boss of the company. Moreover, if your startup has raised less than $250,000, your team can still qualify for IEP by submitting evidence of your startup’s potential for rapid growth and job creation. Take a listen to my podcast <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">episode on IEP</a>, which goes over the process for applying and answers some of the most frequently asked questions that I receive.</p>
<p>If your co-founders pursue IEP, I highly recommend, as usual, that they work with an immigration attorney. It’s especially important here because the stakes are so high for your company and because this is a new program, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers have little experience reviewing IEP applications. Additionally, your startup’s fundraising falls short of $250,000 from U.S. investors, so you’ll need strong legal arguments about your qualifications.</p>
<p>How new is this program? Well, it already has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">a lot of history</a>. Even though IEP has been available since 2017, the previous administration had unsuccessfully tried to eliminate it. Only recently did the Department of Homeland Security withdraw the proposal to rescind the IEP program, which has been available since 2017, and the the Biden administration announced it would fully implement it.</p>
<p>A 2020 Congressional Research Report on “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46570">Immigration Parole</a>” noted that USCIS had received 28 IEP applications from the time it began them through February 10, 2020. Of those, only one was approved, 22 were denied, three were withdrawn and two were pending.</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how long USCIS will take to make a determination on IEP applications — and USCIS said in a recent stakeholder meeting that there is no processing time yet. My law firm is in the process of submitting several applications on behalf of clients and hope to have decisions soon. We’ll keep you posted!</p>

<h2>How parole works</h2>
<p>The secretary of Homeland Security and agencies within Homeland Security, including USCIS and Customs and Border Patrol, have the ability to grant parole, which allows entry to and a temporary stay in the United States. Parole has traditionally been granted for urgent humanitarian reasons, such as to persecuted refugees or those seeking medical treatment in the U.S., or to serve a public benefit, such as providing disaster assistance, cooperating with law enforcement or testifying at a trial.</p>
<p>Created by the Obama administration after Congress failed to create a startup visa, IEP allows entrepreneurs who provide a “significant public benefit” by creating jobs for American workers and expanding the U.S. economy to temporarily stay in the U.S. to grow their startup. If USCIS approves an IEP application, the entrepreneur will receive a parole document that is valid initially for 30 months.</p>
<p>Parole is not a non-immigrant (temporary) visa status, which means your co-founders cannot simply file to change their status from an H-1B or F-1 to IEP while living in the U.S. To be granted parole, your founders must leave the U.S. and reenter and get a stamp by a border officer to be “paroled” into the U.S.</p>
<p>If an entrepreneur is approved for IEP, then their spouse and dependent children (unmarried and under 21 years) are also eligible for parole during that same period. Once they arrive in the U.S., spouses are eligible to file for a work permit that would allow them to get a job or start their own business.</p>
<h2>IEP eligibility requirements</h2>
<p>To qualify for IEP, each of your co-founders will need to show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your startup is a U.S. corporation that is less than five years old.</li>
<li>They have at least a 10% ownership stake in the startup.</li>
<li>They are central to and play an active role in the startup. I recommend that your co-founders have a C-suite title, such as chief executive officer, chief operations officer or chief technology officer, and/or a senior-level title, such as president.</li>
<li>Your startup has received at least $250,000 from qualified U.S. investors or at least $100,000 in grants or awards from federal, state or local governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your startup has only received $200,000, your co-founders will need to provide compelling evidence of your company’s potential for rapid growth and job creation, such as its users or customers, revenue, social impact, far reaching or national scope, or positive local or regional effects. Your attorney can support you with these legal arguments.</p>
<p>To extend IEP for another 30 months, your co-founders will need to show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They continue to play a central and active role with the company.</li>
<li>They have at least a 5% ownership stake.</li>
</ul>
<p>And one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your startup has received at least $500,000 from qualified investments and/or qualified government grants or awards.</li>
<li>Your startup has created at least five full-time jobs with the startup entity during the initial parole period.</li>
<li>Your startup has at least $500,000 in annual revenue in the United States and averaged 20% in annual revenue growth during the initial parole period.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your startup entity partially meets funding, job creation or annual revenue criteria, your co-founders must provide compelling evidence that the startup entity continues to show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation with the support of your attorney.</p>
<p>Although there is no wage requirement under the IEP program (like there is for H-1B visa), each of your co-founders will need to have a household income that is greater than 400% of the federal poverty line for their household size as defined by the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">Department of Health and Human Services</a>. For example, based on today’s requirements, a family of four would need to have a household income of more than $106,000.</p>
<p>My hope is that by the time your co-founders are ready to extend their IEP, there will already be new laws in place for a startup visa and green card pathway for startup founders. I was honored to work on this draft legislation with <a href="https://nvca.org/about-us/staff/jeff-farrah/">Jeff Farrah</a> of the National Venture Capital Association, and hopefully we’ll see some announcements soon!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is going to be <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/axiom-announcement/index.html">providing more rides</a> to private astronauts to the International Space Station, on top of the previously announced mission set to take place as early as next January. All four of these flights will be for Axiom, a private commercial spaceflight and space station company, and they&#8217;re set to take place between early next year through 2023.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 spacecraft make up the first commercial launch system certified for transporting humans to the ISS, and they&#8217;ve already delivered three groups of NASA astronauts to the orbital lab, including one demo crew for its final qualification test, and two operational crews to live and work on the station. In May, Axiom and NASA revealed the details of their AX-1 mission, the first all-private launch to the ISS, which will carry four passengers to the station on a Crew Dragon to live and work in space for a duration of eight days in total.</p>
<p>NASA and SpaceX will be providing training to all four of the Axiom crews set to make the trip to the station. And while neither SpaceX or Axiom has shared more details yet  on what the other three missions will entail, or when they&#8217;re set to take place, four missions in two years technically absorbs all the existing capacity NASA has allocated for private astronaut missions, which is set at 2 per year, for 2022 and 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One private astronaut flight to the ISS is already set for 2021: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa booked a ride to the station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket for early December. Maezawa booked through Space Adventures, which has already provided a handful of trips for deep-pocketed private astronauts over the course of the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Axiom meanwhile envisions a somewhat less niche, and more continually active future for commercial orbital space stations. The company is already working on a commercial module to be added to the existing ISS, and has designs on building a fully private successor to the station in future. Booking four trips with multiple crew members in two years goes a long way towards showing there&#8217;s more than just very sporadic demand from eccentric rich people for this kind of offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Faction Technology founder and CEO Ain McKendrick didn&#8217;t have the $1 billion or the time that a typical automotive program might need to design and manufacture an EV that could be used for driverless delivery.</p>
<p>So, he turned to power sports to fulfill his vision of a micro-logistics service that can be used for driverless delivery or rented and operated by a human for jaunts around the city. Now, with prototypes built and an ambition to scale, McKendrick has raised $4.3 million in seed funding led by Trucks VC and Fifty Years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep doing the same things over and over again,&#8221; said McKendrick, who was previously VP of engineering at the now shuttered self-driving truck startup Starsky Robotics. &#8220;We keep taking legacy vehicles and trying to retrofit them for driverless technologies. Rather than do the same stuff over and over again, how about we do it a little bit differently?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.factionmoto.com/">Faction</a>, which launched last year and graduated this winter from the Y Combinator accelerator program, started with a three-wheel motorcycle platform. While the company is building the chassis from the ground up, McKendrick says it can be accomplished at a fraction of the cost of manufacturing an automobile. The vehicle costs about $30,000 in all, which McKendrick said has a payback period of two years.</p>
<p>These are motorcycle-class vehicles, which means they are legal for city streets and highways but don&#8217;t have some of the same requirements that passenger vehicles do.</p>
<p>The vehicles can deliver cargo, which is accomplished through a combination of autonomy and a remote worker using teleoperations to assist. Faction, which is about a 10-person team, is working with other companies for the autonomous vehicle stack. However, it has developed a core platform with safety features that will step in if the autonomous system fails.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core technology that we&#8217;re building for these vehicles is actually something we aspire to bring to other vehicle formats, as the company grows over time,&#8221; he said, adding that they have developed a digital vehicle architecture and a teleoperation system, which work together.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160183" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160183" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2160183 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Faction_T1_Delivery.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160183" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Faction Technology</p></div></p>
<p>Delivery, or micro-logistics as McKendrick calls it, is the first focus of the company. However, the founder also sees an opportunity to build out fleets of its three-wheeled vehicles and rent them out to people who want to use them for three- to five-mile trips around cities, or even longer distance from a city to a nearby suburb. These vehicles would be nearly the same with a few key differences, like a glass canopy for the human operator versions. The delivery vehicles would have an opaque canopy.</p>
<p>McKendrick envisions users being able to hail one of its vehicles through an app. The vehicle would then drive itself to the user. Once they step inside, it would be manually operated by the human driver.</p>
<p>McKendrick&#8217;s pitch is that users get all the convenience of a scooter or bike share, but have weather protection and highway capability.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if you need to run from say, San Francisco down to San Francisco Airport, this is the perfect format of vehicle to do it for you, as opposed to trying to do more four-door sedans and larger-format vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the driverless delivery applications, the user would be charged on a per-mile basis. McKendrick said they may charge by the hour for the vehicle rentals.</p>
<p>The company is working now to form partnerships with manufacturers of light electric vehicles to scale operational fleets, and plans to announce the first customer trials later this year. McKendrick said the goal is to deploy a small fleet of about 50 vehicles for the micro-logistics pilot and start some early rider trials by the fourth quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joby Aviation is partnering with one of the country’s largest parking garage operators and a real estate acquisition company to build out its network of vertiports, with an initial focus on Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, the company said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The partnership with REEF Technology and Neighborhood Property Group will give Joby “access to an unparalleled range of rooftop locations across all key metropolitan areas in the US, as well as a mechanism to fund the acquisition and development of new skyport sites,” Joby said in a statement.</p>
<p>Building out a convenient, accessible and large network of locations to hitch a ride on an air taxi will likely be a key factor determining which companies succeed in attracting would-be riders to their service. The current infrastructure to support helicopters is limited, especially in urban areas, where electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies intend to launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The deal will give Joby exclusive access to the sites for a period, during which it said it can secure long-term leases within REEF’s real estate network.</p>
<p>Until now little has been known about the electric aircraft giant’s intentions regarding its aerial ridesharing network, although founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt has publicly talked about the benefits of using existing parking garages.</p>
<p>Such structures are typically in dense areas, they’re large and they’re built out of robust material that can support multiple small aircraft. But perhaps most importantly, parking garages already house cars, another form of transportation that will likely work hand-in-hand with air taxis in serving first- and last-mile segments of a journey.</p>
<p>REEF, which began as parking lot management and servicing company ParkJockey, now operates around 4,500 mobility and logistics hubs that it says reaches 70% of the North American urban population. REEF <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/">raised $700 million</a> from SoftBank, the Mubadala Corp. and others last November.</p>
<p>In addition to the new partnership, Joby said its vertiport network will use existing heliport and regional airport locations.</p>
<p>“This is a landmark deal on Joby’s path to building a transformational ridesharing service in our skies,” Bevirt said in a statement. “NPG and REEF have an unbeatable network of sites across the US and we’re excited to be working with them to identify sites that will become the backbone of our future service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take a close look at any ambitious startup and you&#8217;ll find pugnacity nestled in its core. Stubbornness and a bullheaded belief in the worth of what a company wants to bring to fruition is often the biggest driver of its success, and the people at such companies also tend to share this quality.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&#8217;t be too far off the mark to say the people at Expensify are a stubborn lot — to the company&#8217;s ultimate benefit. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">group of P2P pirates/hackers</a> that set out to build an expense management app stuck to their gut, made their own rules. They asked questions few thought of, like: Why have lots of employees when you can find a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">get work done and reach impressive profitability with a few</a>? Why work from an office in San Francisco when the internet lets you work from anywhere, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/">a sailboat in the Caribbean?</a></p>
<p>It makes sense in a way: If you&#8217;re a pirate, to hell with the rules, right? And even more so when nobody can explain the rules in the first place.</p>
<p>With that in mind, one could assume Expensify decided to ask itself: Why not build our own totally custom tech stack? Indeed, Expensify has made several tech decisions that were met with disbelief — from having an open-source frontend and cross-platform mobile development to hiring contractors to train its AI and recruiting open-source contributors — but its belief in its own choices has paid off over the years, and the company is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">ready to IPO</a> any day now.</p>
<p>How much of a tech advantage Expensify enjoys owing to such choices is an open question, but one thing is clear: These choices are key to understanding Expensify and its roadmap. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h2>Built on Bedrock</h2>
<p>I think another question Expensify also decided to ask in its early days was something like: Why not have our database on top of a technology that&#8217;s built for small-scale application software?</p>
<p>It may sound incredible, but Expensify actually runs on a custom database built on top of SQLite. This is surprising, because despite being one of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most widely deployed database engines</a>, SQLite is known for running on small, embedded systems like smartphones and web browsers, not powering enterprise-scale databases.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It may sound incredible, but Expensify actually runs on a custom database built on top of SQLite.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This custom database is called <a href="https://bedrockdb.com/">Bedrock</a>, and its architecture is as unique as they come. <a href="https://finovate.com/videos/findevr-silicon-valley-2016-expensify/">Expensify</a> explains it as an &#8220;RDBMS optimized for self-healing replication across relatively slow, relatively unreliable WAN (internet) connections, enabling extremely high availability/high performance multi-datacenter deployments without any single point of failure.&#8221; RDBMS means relational database management system, describing SQLite and other row-based databases where entries are interconnected with each other.</p>
<p>But why would Expensify build this instead of going for any number of widely available enterprise database solutions?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to go back to the early days of the company, which was originally a side project for its founder and CEO, David Barrett. His initial idea was to develop a prepaid card for the homeless, but this required putting a server on the Visa network, which brought several strict requirements and challenges. &#8220;I would say one of the most difficult [parts] was that I needed the ability to automatically replicate and failover,&#8221; Barrett told TechCrunch when we interviewed him a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>This was no easy feat in 2007, but Barrett was up for the challenge. &#8220;I just hit a moment where the technology available off the shelf just wasn&#8217;t that good. And I happened to be a peer-to-peer software developer who had tons of spare time and really wanted to build this thing to put on the Visa backend,&#8221; he said. The P2P aspect was important, as Barrett had the skills to make it work. His first hires for Expensify, P2P engineers he had worked with at Red Swoosh and Akamai, were also unusually suited for the job.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For years now, the world of retail has been evolving. Whether it&#8217;s next-day delivery with Amazon Prime or subscription D2C services or on-demand delivery from Postmates, we&#8217;re growing increasingly accustomed to being able to buy something and have it arrive at our door relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Today, a new startup is launching in New York with a fresh take on on-demand delivery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jokr.it/">JOKR</a>, founded by Ralf Wenzel (the same guy who founded Foodpanda, which later merged with Delivery Hero), promises delivery in 15 minutes or less, with no order minimums, and a selection of products that you might find in the local deli or convenience store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The approach is centered around what JOKR calls micro-hubs, which are really just various storefronts on side streets in denser areas. The company uses data to forecast what customers will want, when, and where, to strategically organize these micro-fulfillment centers for speed.</p>
<p>For end users, there are no order minimums and no delivery fees.</p>
<p>Data is the key ingredient to identify what customers need and put an emphasis not only on what they need, but also when they need it. And what point of time, which day, which week, which month, whether it&#8217;s in the morning or in the evening, and build a dynamic inventory and catalog management system that is able to rotate inventory, provide inventory and pre-forecast suggestions for customers, those type of consumer goods, and the corresponding time.</p>
<p>JOKR procures the goods sold on the app directly from brands, manufacturers and wholesalers. In other words, you can think of the service as a sort of ghost kitchen for groceries and everyday items.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a platform that is not relying on any type of consumer charges,&#8221; said Wenzel. &#8220;Hence, the business is predominantly a business that generates revenue out of the respective product costs. Our ability to procure directly, and cut out middlemen in terms of wholesalers, distributors, supermarkets themselves, allows us to tap into a margin pool that is higher than that of traditional online marketplaces, which would only pick a product from existing stores, supermarkets, and then need to apply a delivery fee in order to make their proposition work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is working to increase its inventory, which currently includes more than 1,500 items.</p>
<p>In terms of the workforce, JOKR delivery people are full-time employees.</p>
<p>JOKR has been operating in Latin America (Brazil, Lima and Mexico City) and is now expanding into the U.S. market with its NYC launch.</p>
<p>According to TheRealDeal, JOKR has funding from SoftBank, as well as HV Capital and Tiger Global. It&#8217;s unclear how much the startup has raised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies increasingly rely on data to run their businesses, having accurate sources of data becomes paramount. <a href="http://stemma.ai">Stemma</a>, a new early-stage startup, has come up with a solution, a managed data catalogue that acts as an organization&#8217;s source of truth.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $4.8 million seed investment led by Sequoia with assorted individual tech luminaries also participating. The product is also available for the first time today.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Mark Grover says the product is actually built on top of the open-source <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a> data catalogue project that he helped launch at Lyft to manage its massive data requirements. The problem was that with so much data, employees had to kludge together systems to confirm the data validity. Ultimately manual processes like asking someone in Slack or even creating a Wiki failed under the weight of trying to keep up with the volume and velocity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I saw this problem firsthand at Lyft, which led me to create the open-source Amundsen project with a team of talented engineers,&#8221; Grover said. That project has 750 users at Lyft using it every week. Since it was open-sourced, 35 companies like Brex, Snap and Asana have been using it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpPArB2IoI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/toro-snags-4m-seed-investment-to-monitor-data-quality/">Toro snags $4M seed investment to monitor data quality</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Toro snags $4M seed investment to monitor data quality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/toro-snags-4m-seed-investment-to-monitor-data-quality/embed/#?secret=hpPArB2IoI" data-secret="hpPArB2IoI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What Stemma offers is a managed version of Amundsen that adds functionality like using intelligence to show data that&#8217;s meaningful to the person who is searching in the catalogue. It also can add metadata automatically to data as it&#8217;s added to the catalogue, creating documentation about the data on the fly, among other features.</p>
<p>The company launched last fall when Grover and co-founder and CTO Dorian Johnson decided to join forces and create a commercial product on top of Amundsen. Grover points out that Lyft was supportive of the move.</p>
<p>Today the company has five employees, in addition to the founders, and has plans to add several more this year. As he does that, he is cognizant of diversity and inclusion in the hiring process. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s super important that we continue to invest in diversity, and the two ways that I think are the most meaningful for us right now is to have early employees that are from diverse groups, and that is the case within the first five,&#8221; he said. Beyond that, he says that as the company grows he wants to improve the ratio, while also looking at diversity in investors, board members and executives.</p>
<p>The company, which launched during COVID, is entirely remote right now and plans to remain that way for at least the short term. As the company grows, they will look at ways to build camaraderie, like organizing a regular cadence of employee offsite events.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's dissection of the public offering market paints a generally positive picture of the IPO market for venture-backed companies.]]></description>

<p>We care because it&#8217;s worth knowing what current demand is for venture-backed shares on the public markets. The third quarter is expected by many in the private markets to be an active period for exits. So, for founders, investors, and a host of technology startup employees, we&#8217;re gearing up for a busy period.</p>
<p>And today&#8217;s IPO climate could be the on-ramp to that rush of unicorn liquidity. So let&#8217;s understand where we&#8217;re starting through the prism of debut updates en masse.</p>
<h2>Marqeta</h2>
<ul>
<li>First IPO price range: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1522540/000119312521177861/d64065ds1a.htm">$20 to $24 per share.</a></li>
<li>Max IPO raise: $1,254,545,448.</li>
<li>Implied simple valuation range: $10.6 billion to $12.7 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last known private-market value of Marqeta was set in May 2020, when the company raised $150 million at what <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> estimates was a $4.3 billion valuation. From that perspective, the company could up to triple its final private valuation in its public debut. There was some other money sloshing around the company since that May round, however, so its pricing could have shifted some in the intervening months.</p>
<p><strong>Our read is that even if Marqeta does not raise its IPO range, its pricing is bullish</strong>, and if it <em>does</em> raise its range, it could become even more so. At a flat $12 billion price, the company&#8217;s Q1 2021 run rate puts it on a 27.8x revenue multiple. That&#8217;s rich.</p>
<h2>1st Dibs</h2>
<ul>
<li>First IPO price range: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1600641/000119312521179144/d244039ds1a.htm">$18 to $21 per share.</a></li>
<li>Max IPO raise: $138,862,500.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Think you&#8217;re living in a hyper-connected world? Huawei&#8217;s proprietary HarmonyOS wants to eliminate delays and gaps in user experience when you move from one device onto another by adding interoperability to all devices, regardless of the system that powers them.</p>
<p>Two years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/why-startups-need-to-be-careful-about-export-licenses-and-the-huawei-ban/">Huawei was added to the U.S. entity list</a> that banned the Chinese telecom giant from accessing U.S. technologies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">core chipsets</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/">Android developer services from Google</a>, Huawei&#8217;s alternative smartphone operating system was unveiled.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Huawei officially launched its proprietary operating system HarmonyOS for mobile phones. The firm began building the operating system in 2016 and made it open-source for tablets, electric vehicles and smartwatches last September. Its flagship devices such as Mate 40 could upgrade to HarmonyOS starting Wednesday, with the operating system gradually rolling out on lower-end models in the coming quarters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HarmonyOS is not meant to replace Android or iOS, Huawei said. Rather, its application is more far-reaching, powering not just phones and tablets but an increasing number of smart devices. To that end, Huawei has been trying to attract hardware and home appliance manufacturers to join its ecosystem.</p>
<p>To date, more than 500,000 developers are building applications based on HarmonyOS. It&#8217;s unclear whether Google, Facebook and other mainstream apps in the West are working on HarmonyOS versions.</p>
<p>Some Chinese tech firms have answered Huawei&#8217;s call. Smartphone maker Meizu <a href="https://weibo.com/2683843043/KhxyFlAd3?from=page_1006062683843043_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment">hinted</a> on its Weibo account that its smart devices might adopt HarmonyOS. Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/">much larger players than Meizu</a>, are probably more reluctant to embrace a rival&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p>Huawei&#8217;s goal is to collapse all HarmonyOS-powered devices into one single control panel, which can, say, remotely pair the Bluetooth connections of headphones and a TV. A game that is played on a phone can be continued seamlessly on a tablet. A smart soymilk blender can customize a drink based on the health data gleaned from a user&#8217;s smartwatch.</p>
<p>Devices that aren&#8217;t already on HarmonyOS can also communicate with Huawei devices with a simple plug-in. Photos from a Windows-powered laptop can be saved directly onto a Huawei phone if the computer has the HarmonyOS plug-in installed. That raises the question of whether Android, or even iOS, could, one day, talk to HarmonyOS through a common language.</p>
<p>The HarmonyOS launch arrived days before Apple&#8217;s annual developer event scheduled for next week. A recent job posting from Apple mentioned a seemingly new concept, homeOS, which may have to do with Apple&#8217;s smart home strategy, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/">noted</a> by MacRumors.</p>
<p>Huawei denied speculations that HarmonyOS is a derivative of Android and said no single line of code is identical to that of Android. A spokesperson for Huawei declined to say whether the operating system is based on Linux, the kernel that powers Android.</p>
<p>Several tech giants have tried to introduce their own mobile operating systems, to no avail. Alibaba built AliOS based on Linux but has long stopped updating it. Samsung<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/all-of-samsungs-new-smart-tvs-will-run-its-tizen-operating-system/"> flirted with its own Tizen</a> but the operating system is limited to powering a few Internet of Things, like smart TVs.</p>
<p>Huawei may have a better shot at drumming up developer interest compared to its predecessors. It&#8217;s still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/">one of China&#8217;s largest smartphone brands</a> despite losing a chunk of its market after the U.S. government cut it off from critical chip suppliers, which could hamper its ability to make cutting-edge phones. HarmonyOS also has a chance to create an alternative for developers who are disgruntled with Android, if Huawei is able to capture their needs.</p>
<p>The U.S. sanctions do not block Huawei from using Android&#8217;s open-source software, which major Chinese smartphone makers use to build their third-party Android operating system. But the ban was like a death knell for Huawei&#8217;s consumer markets overseas as its phones abroad lost access to Google Play services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is emerging from stealth today with $131 million in total funding, including $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $31 million in equity consists of a new $26 million Series A and a previously unannounced $5 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the Series A funding, which also included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YC Continuity Fund, Jaguar Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund, Uncorrelated Ventures, Clocktower Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford University, 9 Yards Capital and BlockFi Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile group of angel investors also put money in the round, including NFL wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and the founders of five LatAm unicorns — Nubank CEO David Velez, Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia, Rappi co-founder Sebastian Mejia, Bitso CEO Daniel Vogel and Loft CEO Florian Hagenbuch. Justo’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Weder also participated in this round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid co-founder William Hockey put money in the $5 million seed funding that closed in 2020 after the company completed the YC Summer 2020 batch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering is currently live in Mexico — its largest market — as well as Colombia, Canada and the U.S., and is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dileep Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country &#8212; a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159750" style="width: 676px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159750" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159750 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="325" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Jeeves co-founders Dileep Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card, noncard payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets &#8212; cash, corporate cards, cross-border &#8212; all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really building two things &#8212; an infrastructure layer that sits across banking institutions in different countries. And then on top of that, we&#8217;re building the customer-, or end user-facing app,” he added. “What gives us the ability to launch in countries much quicker is that we own part of that stack ourselves, versus what most fintechs would do, which is plug into a third-party provider in that region.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159753" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159753" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2159753 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159753" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jeeves</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the company has seen rapid early growth. Since launching its private beta last October, Jeeves says it has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by 200x and increased revenue by 900% (albeit from a small base). In May alone, Jeeves says it processed more transaction volume than the entire year to date, and more than doubled its customer base. It says that “hundreds of companies,” including Bitso, Belvo, Justo, Runa, Worky, Zinboe, RobinFood and Muncher, “actively” use Jeeves to manage their local and international spend. On top of that, it says, the startup has a waitlist of more than 5,000 companies &#8212; which is part of why the company sought to raise debt and equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift to remote work globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic has played a large role in why Jeeves has seen so much demand, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every company is now becoming a global company, and the service to employees in two different countries requires two different systems,” he said. “And then someone&#8217;s got to reconcile that system at the end of the month. This has been a big reason why we’re growing so fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Jeeves’ biggest accomplishments so far, Thazhmon said, has been receiving approval to issue cards from its own credit BIN (bank identification number) in Mexico. It can also run SPEI payments directly on its infrastructure. (SPEI </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a system developed and operated by Banco de </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">México</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows the general public to make electronic payments.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gives us a lot of flexibility and allows us to offer a truly unique product to our customers,” said Thazhmon, who previously co-founded PowerInbox, a<br />
Battery Ventures-backed MarTech company that he says grew to $40 million in annual revenue in three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves says it will use the fresh capital to onboard new companies to the platform from its waitlist, scale its infrastructure to cover more countries and currencies as well as do some hiring and expand its product line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A16z General Partner Angela Strange, who is joining Jeeves’ board as part of the investment, is extremely bullish on the startup’s potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange says she met Thazhmon about a year ago and was immediately intrigued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only were they working to provide the financial operating system within a country, starting in Mexico, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they were designing their software platform to scale across multiple countries,” she said. “Finally &#8212; a multicountry/currency expense management &amp; payouts platform, where increasingly companies have employees and operations in multiple countries from the start and can use a single company to manage their financials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange, who has been investing in Latin America for the past few years, notes that most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies in the region are unable to get a corporate credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s only the tip of the iceberg,” she told TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s cumbersome for companies to make bank to bank payouts, handle wires, and they usually also have expenses in the U.S. (and often other countries) so there is also FX. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they manage multiple bank accounts. Not only is paying hard, reconciliation on the backend takes weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Strange said, with every country having their own bank transfer system, rules around who can issue a credit card, approved payment processors, currencies and bank accounts &#8212; payments and expense management across countries can be complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves, according</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Strange, “gets as close to the networks/payment rails as possible” since it has its own issuing credit BIN versus needing to connect through legacy players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing an orchestration layer on top of all the rails gives Jeeves the ability “to handle all the payment and reconciliation complexity” so “their customers don&#8217;t have to think about it,” she added.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> dug into the burgeoning sports media, sports gaming and fantasy sports world through the lens of some early-stage startups. Naturally, the Equity team is what comes to mind when you consider the correct and right people to discuss sports. We are here to back up your priors.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, we had a good time digging into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/women-led-sports-media-startup-the-gist-raises-1m-to-challenge-sports-reporting-norms/">THE GIST raised $1 million</a>. Both Natasha and Alex were very bullish on the company&#8217;s product, focus and market. Especially in light of some recent media deals that have kept our hearts aflutter over the last few quarters.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fantasy-fantasy-sport-blaseball-developers-score-3m-seed-funding-to-go-mobile/">Blaseball raised $3 million</a>. Whether it is blah-ZAY-ball, or BLACE-ball, the Equity team thinks that having <em>fantasy</em> fantasy sports is meta, good fun, and perhaps appeal-broadening the larger, somewhat hoary world of baseball. Also baseball could use more whimsy in general.</li>
<li>And the fantasy talk continued as we got to cricket, which is a massively adored and obsessed-over sport in India especially. Dream11&#8217;s parent firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation/">raised $225 million at an over $2.5 billion valuation</a> to build an end-to-end sports tech company around the sport.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;d venture to say we are probably the only tech podcast this week that found an angle to riff on within sports and donuts, which is why we love our jobs and why we hope you love the show. Surprises keep things fun, and much love to our producers, <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, for constantly sourcing creative material that may have flown under the radar otherwise.</p>
<p>Back Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The bike had none of the usual signage when I took it for a spin around the chaotic and construction-filled streets of Manhattan. It very much looked like a prototype, with visible soldering on the joints and a not-quite-complete AV system. But it handled well, when merging in and out of traffic &#8212; and at the end of the day, that’s the most important thing.</p>
<p>Pilots for Lyft’s new e-bike begin this month. The ride-hailing service will begin offering units in cities where it operates, starting with San Francisco, then Chicago and New York. The locations will be somewhat randomized, as a kind of “Easter egg” system where users will randomly stumble on the shiny new electric bicycles. If you’re lucky enough to experience one in the wild, Lyft will shoot you an email, asking how your experience was.</p>
<p>Mine was pretty good, all told &#8212; but for that moment I got clipped by a delivery driver. But that’s life in the big city &#8212; and I was probably making too wide a turn, my first time on the 80-pound e-bike (20 pounds more than their predecessor). The weight of the thing (owing primarily to a massive new battery on the downtube) concerned me at first, but the bike handles surprisingly well. The pedal assist is smooth and seamless. At a cruising speed, I found that I only had to pump a few times per block.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The ride was limited &#8212; almost entirely on flat ground, meaning I didn’t get to experience the pedal assist to test riding up a bridge on ramp or one of San Francisco’s notorious hills.</p>
<p>The new bikes arrive not long after Lyft deployed their last e-bike fleet (though those were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142346/citi-bike-electric-ebike-nyc-return-brake-malfunction">not without incident</a>). Still, the company says it essentially built these from scratch.</p>
<p>“There are a ton of mom and pop as well as large-scale consumer vendors for e-bikes. But a fleet e-bike is a drastically different thing,” product manager Gary Shambat told TechCrunch. “They might look similar on the outside, but the wear and tear and the vandalism cases are so supremely different that you can’t just take an existing product, patch it up in a few ways, throw on a connected module and call it a day.”</p>

<p>The pedal assist is powered by a 500W motor and a pretty massive battery the company says is capable of a 60-mile range &#8212; meaning it should be able to get through a couple of rides without needing a full charge. All of that is monitored by a system of sensors designed to send out alerts when there’s an issue with the battery or breaks.</p>
<p>The white body is reflective and there’s an LED ring light up front that can change colors. The company says it’s testing different applications, beyond a simple headlight and bike locator. The ring is segmented and can turn various colors, so something like turn signals could make sense going forward. There are nice little touches throughout, as well &#8212; like the hand-bar grip, which is designed to look like tiny mustaches as a nod to that odd accoutrement from the service’s early days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.synctera.com/">Synctera</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which aims to serve as a matchmaker for community banks and fintechs, has raised $33 million in a Series A round of funding led by Fin VC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise comes just under six months after the fintech raised $12.4 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Mastercard and Gaingels also participated in the latest round, which included follow-on investments from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Diagram Ventures, SciFi Ventures and Scribble Ventures. Several angel investors put money in the Series A including Omri Dahan, Marqeta’s Chief Revenue Officer, Feedzai Chairman and CEO Nuno Sebastiao and Greenlight co-founder and CEO Tim Sheehan. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the Series A, Synctera is also announcing its commitment to the</span><a href="http://captablecoalition.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Table Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which includes funding from Gaingels, Neythri Futures Fund, Plexo Capital and over 20 angels – alongside other startups by allocating 10% of all funding rounds to “traditionally marginalized,” or underrepresented, investors via an SPV. (Fellow fintech Finix </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led the initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year before forming this coalition but more on that later).</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HDx5uHGUaF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/">Fintech startup Finix closes on $3M in Black and Latinx investor-led SPV</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech startup Finix closes on $3M in Black and Latinx investor-led SPV&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/embed/#?secret=HDx5uHGUaF" data-secret="HDx5uHGUaF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has exposed us to find great folks who we otherwise might not have known,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synctera’s co-founder and CEO Peter Hazlehurst. “That’s why we pledge to reserve 10% of this round and all future rounds to diverse investors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, San Francisco-based Synctera has developed a platform designed to help facilitate partnership banking. It was founded on the premise that some community banks and credit unions are actually turning down deals with young fintechs because the relationships can be too complicated or time-consuming to manage. Synctera’s goal is to connect community banks and fintechs to streamline the process with its “Banking-as-a-Service” (BaaS) platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch recently caught up with Hazlehurst, who most recently served as former head of Uber Money and previously also led development of Google Wallet</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and products related to its payments system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Synctera wants to make it easier for community banks and fintechs to partner with each other. It examines banks’ needs and then sets them up with a fintech that is best suited to meet those needs. It claims to “do the work for both parties,” managing the partnership from its back-end platform, while dealing with issues like regulatory compliance, which can be a deterrent for some companies. The process of managing, reconciling and billing banks can result in “a lot of operational overhead and complexity,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it’s built a “diverse” marketplace of banks and fintech companies so that it can apply a “personalized touch to each match” and make sure that the parties “align on geography, brand ethos, and desired business goals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Synctera has signed three banks with plans to sign on three more this month. The startup has already paired Coastal Community Bank – a local bank serving the greater Puget Sound community – with One, a new digital banking platform, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellevest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new fintech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using Synctera’s platform, the company claims, banks can more freely allow their fintech counterparts to offer FDIC-insured mobile checking, debit cards, savings accounts or innovations in payments to their prospective customers, the company claims. They can also make more money doing so, Hazlehurst said, by bringing in more revenue beyond interchange fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like most small businesses, community banks have been hit hard by COVID-19,” he added. “We hope to further diversify community banks’ revenue streams.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks can also more easily manage multiple relationships with various fintechs as the companies agree to adopt Synctera’s tech stack, the company claims.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We build a single dashboard for a bank, so there’s a consolidated position across all fintechs,” Hazlehurst told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “It’s all about visibility for the bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently Synctera has about 50 employees, including about two dozen engineers, most of whom are located in Canada, Hazlehurst said. The company plans to ramp up to 160 employees by year’s end with a focus on engineering, sales, marketing and customer success staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hazlehurst predicts that the fourth quarter will be “all about support for small business fintechs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to create a neobank for gig economy workers, and want to add lending as a service,” he said. “But our next big phase is to onboard a lot of fintechs, and learn from them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan Allin, managing general partner and founder at Fin VC, believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking-as-a-Service in general will transform legacy national and regional banks, credit unions, fintecs, corporate tech and retailers alike “as these players either seek to vertically integrate financial services or accelerate their digitization process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synctera, he adds, has taken an approach with its tech stack that allows for integration with legacy community banks and their respective cores. This, Allin believes, will help ensure a “cloud native and scalable model” and made it an attractive investment. (Fin VC has also backed the likes of other fintechs such as Pipe and SoFi).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Synctera&#8217;s peers are simply abstracting bank cores and serving as ‘API wrappers’ in a kludgy short-term approach and having come from the legacy bank and modern fintech worlds, we recognized that these players had not built sufficiently strong bridges across the ecosystem,” Allin told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Finix Founder Richie Serna is thrilled that other startups are following his lead in the pledge to make their cap tables more diverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Finix announced our special purpose vehicle for Black and Latinx investors, the response was overwhelmingly positive,” he told TechCrunch. “Startups in every sector and at every stage have asked us how to recreate our SPV. In response, we started the Cap Table Coalition to make it as easy as possible for more high-growth startups, like Synctera, to take control over their cap tables,&#8221; said Richie Serna, CEO and co-founder of Finix. &#8220;We see this as an inflection point that will completely upend how the VC world functions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Synctera is not the only player trying to help banks and fintechs forge partnerships. Last week, TechCrunch reported on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa said it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded its Visa Fintech Partner Connect program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a “vetted and curated” set of technology providers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most strategically important financial relationships for neobanks is becoming the account destination for a user’s paycheck. If you’re a bank and you own that specific relationship, users will increasingly use that account for everything from daily spending to saving (after all, that’s where their money is going). That activity in turn leads to expansive opportunities to upsell users to other financial products and generate the kinds of fees that banks love to make.</p>
<p>It just so happens though that users are often baffled in how to change their direct deposit instructions. To do so, they still have to go into ancient payroll systems, fill out account and routing data, verify that it’s correctly setup and more — all steps that can fluster users who will just give up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinwheelapi.com">Pinwheel</a> is a “payroll connectivity” API designed to bridge this divide. It helps neobanks and other clients connect into a users’s payroll information system, offering everything from direct-deposit switching to income verification (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/income-verification-is-white-hot-right-now-and-plaid-wants-in/">hot space these days</a>), and paycheck-linked lending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s proven very popular, particularly in the midst of the pandemic that saw millions switch jobs as well as neobanks reaching stratospheric growth as account holders searched for cheaper and more flexible banking options. The company saw 11x revenue growth last quarter and claims neobank Current and mobile payment service Square Cash as clients.</p>
<p>That early traction has drawn a new round of capital. Michael Gilroy of Coatue led a $20 million Series A round into the company. Gilroy, who came to Coatue about two years ago from Canaan, has long been interested in fintech, recently investing in companies like B2B receivables platform Melio, financial transaction API Quanto, and teenage neobank Step.</p>
<p>In addition to Coatue, Primary Ventures and Semper Virens newly joined the round, and seed investors First Round Capital and Upfront Ventures re-joined as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/pinwheel-is-the-api-platform-for-income-verification-that-every-fintech-and-neobank-needs/">We last profiled Pinwheel a year ago with its $7 million seed round</a>, exploring how the founders migrated from offering payroll benefits to solving the more fundamental problem of payroll connectivity. Co-founder Curtis Lee, who was then executive chairman and also a venture partner at Primary Ventures, has since moved full-time to become chairman and president of the startup. He said that the company has doubled down particularly on direct-deposit switching as a gateway to the rest of its API offerings.</p>

<p>“For us, it was really about picking one of those and using it as a wedge and then augmenting from there,” Lee said. “Direct-deposit switching was the most urgent and top priority for all of our customers, mostly since there wasn’t much of an alternative.” According to him, the company is becoming a market leader in that strategic niche. “In a quarter, we will be doing close to half of all direct-deposit switches in the neobank market,” he said.</p>

<p>Once a client starts with direct deposits they start to migrate to other offerings like paycheck-linked lending. As low-fee neobanks build up their consumer bases, they are frantically seeking revenue streams to cover their massive growth. Lending is one rich target, and having direct access to payroll data can make it significantly easier to underwrite a loan.</p>
<p>Pinwheel has been aggressively growing its team, expanding from a small coterie a year ago to about 40 people. The company is reopening its office today in the Flatiron District in New York City, and Lee noted that the company is “remote-friendly” and has about a third of its staff outside the NYC metro.</p>
<p>Among notable hires, Lauren Crossett, formerly of Plaid and Quovo, has joined the company as head of commercial. The company has also signed a VP of Engineering, who will join in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to the institutional funds, a litany of individual investors joined the round, including Gokul Rajaram, Adam Nash, Jackie Reses, Raj Date, Tony Xu, Shishir Mehotra, Amit Agarwal and Shiva Rajaraman.</p>
