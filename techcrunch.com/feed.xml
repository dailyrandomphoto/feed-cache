					<description><![CDATA[Orchata's mobile app enables consumers in Mexico to get groceries delivered in 15 minutes with no substitutes and at supermarket prices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luis Mario Garcia grew up in Mexico making deliveries for the grocery stores in his neighborhood. After honing his startup skills in San Francisco, he returned to Mexico with the idea of building a software company.</p>
<p>That’s when he met his co-founder Javier Gonzalez and the pair started <a href="https://www.orchata.com/descargar/">Orchata</a> in 2020, a mobile app enabling consumers to get groceries delivered in 15 minutes, with no substitutes and at supermarket prices. Products delivered include fresh fruit, beverages, bread, medicine and household essentials, Garcia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Orchata does this by operating a network of micro fulfillment centers — it is already operating in two cities — with technology for efficient picking and hyperfast delivery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6732/online-food-delivery-in-latin-america/">Online food delivery sales in Latin America</a> are projected to reach $9.8 billion by 2024, with the global pandemic driving demand for faster delivery, according to Statista. Garcia sees three different waves in this market: the first one being traditional supermarkets, where you can spend hours, which led to the second wave of food delivery companies, including some big players in the region — for example Rappi in Colombia, which in July raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">$500 million in Series F funding at a $5.25 billion valuation</a> in a round led by T. Rowe Price, and Cornershop in Chile, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">acquired by Uber</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, Garcia said many of these services still take more than an hour from order to doorstep and may require phone calls if an item is not available. He wants to be part of a third wave — software that is integrated with inventory and delivery that is super fast, and no substitutions.</p>

<p>“This is similar to what is going on around the world, but there is a huge opportunity to bring convenience, to be the Gopuff for Latin America, and we want to build it first in the region,” Garcia said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Monterrey-based company was part of Y Combinator’s summer 2020 cohort and on Friday announced a $4 million seed round from a group of investors, including Y Combinator, JAM Fund, FJ Labs, Venture Friends, Investo and Foundation Capital, and angel investors Ross Lipson, Mike Hennessey, Brian Requarth and Javier Mata.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lewy, co-founder of Grin Scooters and founder of Investo, is also an investor in Rappi. He said Garcia was building a product for the end user, with the key being the building of the infrastructure and inventory. Lewy believes Garcia understands how quick delivery should be done and that it is not just about offering a mobile app, but building the technology behind it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justin Mateen, general partner at JAM Fund, and co-founder of Tinder and an early-stage investor, met Garcia over a year ago and was one of the company’s first investors. He said Garcia’s and Gonzalez’s initial idea for the model of grocery stores was still not solving the problem, but then they pivoted to doing fulfillment and inventory themselves.</p>
<p>“He fits the mold of what I look for in a founder, and he is the type of founder that doesn’t give up,” Mateen said. “Luis finally agreed to let me double down on my investment. The model makes sense now, he is on to something and it is now going to be about execution of capital as he scales.”</p>
<p>Both Mateen and Lewy agree that there will be similar apps coming because food delivery is such a large market, but that Orchata has a clear advantage of owning the customer experience from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Having only launched four months ago, Orchata is already processing thousands of orders and is seeing 100% monthly growth. The new funding will enable Orchata to expand into three new cities in Mexico. Garcia is also eyeing Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Chile for future expansion.</p>
<p>The company is also targeting multiple use cases, including someone noticing a forgotten item while cooking to consumers shopping for the week or teenagers needing food for a party.</p>
<p>“We are going to be super convenient to customers, and we think every use case for food delivery will be this way in the future,” Garcia said. “We will eventually introduce our own brands and foods with the goal of being that app that is there anytime you need it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ThirdAI is building tools to speed up deep learning technology without the need for hardware like graphics processing units.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houston-based <a href="https://thirdai.com">ThirdAI</a>, a company building tools to speed up deep learning technology without the need for specialized hardware like graphics processing units, brought in $6 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Neotribe Ventures, Cervin Ventures and Firebolt Ventures co-led the investment, which will be used to hire additional employees and invest in computing resources, Anshumali Shrivastava, Third AI co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Shrivastava, who has a mathematics background, was always interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially rethinking how AI could be developed in a more efficient manner. It was when he was at Rice University that he looked into how to make that work for deep learning. He started ThirdAI in April with some Rice graduate students.</p>
<p>ThirdAI’s technology is designed to be “a smarter approach to deep learning,” using its algorithm and software innovations to make general-purpose central processing units (CPU) faster than graphics processing units for training large neural networks, Shrivastava said. Companies abandoned CPUs years ago in favor of graphics processing units that could more quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently. The downside is that there is not much memory in graphics processing units, and users often hit a bottleneck while trying to develop AI, he added.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the landscape of deep learning, we saw that much of the technology was from the 1980s, and a majority of the market, some 80%, were using graphics processing units, but were investing in expensive hardware and expensive engineers and then waiting for the magic of AI to happen,” he said.</p>
<p>He and his team looked at how AI was likely to be developed in the future and wanted to create a cost-saving alternative to graphics processing units. Their algorithm, “sub-linear deep learning engine,” instead uses CPUs that don’t require specialized acceleration hardware.</p>
<p>Swaroop “Kittu” Kolluri, founder and managing partner at Neotribe, said this type of technology is still early. Current methods are laborious, expensive and slow, and for example, if a company is running language models that require more memory, it will run into problems, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That’s where ThirdAI comes in, where you can have your cake and eat it, too,” Kolluri said. “It is also why we wanted to invest. It is not just the computing, but the memory, and ThirdAI will enable anyone to do it, which is going to be a game changer. As technology around deep learning starts to get more sophisticated, there is no limit to what is possible.”</p>
<p>AI is already at a stage where it has the capability to solve some of the hardest problems, like those in healthcare and seismic processing, but he notes there is also a question about climate implications of running AI models.</p>
<p>“Training deep learning models can be more expensive than having five cars in a lifetime,” Shrivastava said. “As we move on to scale AI, we need to think about those.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Manish Maheshwari, the head of Twitter India, has taken a new role at the company and is relocating to the U.S., the latest in a series of developments for the American social giant after a tense stand off with New Delhi this year.</p>
<p>Maheshwari is moving on from the high-profile position, a role he assumed in April 2019, at a time when he was personally named in police cases in at least two Indian states &#8212; Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh &#8212; over complaints that Twitter was allegedly hurting sentiments of people in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The update was shared with Twitter employees on Friday. Maheshwari will be taking on a new role in San Francisco as Senior Director, Revenue Strategy and Operations with focus on New Market Entry and report to Senior Director Deitra Mara, according to an internal email.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the move to TechCrunch, but didn&#8217;t immediately say whether the company had identified who will be filling in Maheshwari&#8217;s India role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of senators sent new Amazon CEO Andy Jassy a letter Friday pressing the company for more information about how it scans and stores customer palm prints for use in some of its retail stores.</p>
<p>The company rolled out the palm print scanners through a program it calls <a href="https://one.amazon.com/">Amazon One</a>, encouraging people to make contactless payments in its brick and mortar stores without the use of a card. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-introduces-the-amazon-one-a-way-to-pay-with-your-palm-when-entering-stores/">introduced its Amazon One scanners late last year</a>, and they can now be found in Amazon Go convenience and grocery stores, Amazon Books and Amazon 4-star stores across the U.S. The scanners are also installed in eight Washington state-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/amazon-is-bringing-its-amazon-one-palm-scanner-to-select-whole-foods-as-a-payment-option/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Whole Foods locations</a>.</p>

<p>In the new letter, Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) press Jassy for details about how Amazon plans to expand its biometric payment system and if the data collected will help the company target ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon’s expansion of biometric data collection through Amazon One raises serious questions about Amazon’s plans for this data and its respect for user privacy, including about how Amazon may use the data for advertising and tracking purposes,&#8221; the senators wrote in the letter, embedded below.</p>
<p>The lawmakers also requested information on how many people have enrolled in Amazon One to date, how Amazon will secure the sensitive data and if the company has ever paired the palm prints with facial recognition data it collects elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast with biometric systems like Apple’s Face ID and Touch ID or Samsung Pass, which store biometric information on a user’s device, Amazon One reportedly uploads biometric information to the cloud, raising unique security risks,&#8221; the senators wrote. &#8220;&#8230; Data security is particularly important when it comes to immutable customer data, like palm prints.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company controversially introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">$10 credit for new users</a> who enroll their palm prints in the program, prompting an outcry from privacy advocates who see it as a cheap tactic to coerce people to hand over sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of reason to be skeptical. Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its other big biometric data project, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/amazon-shareholders-want-the-company-to-stop-selling-facial-recognition-to-law-enforcement/">AI facial recognition software known as Rekognition</a>, which the company provided to U.S. law enforcement agencies before eventually backtracking with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">moratorium on policing applications</a> for the software last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery apps offer convenience for customers, but a host of headaches for restaurants, like commissions <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/856444431/cities-crack-down-on-food-delivery-app-fees-as-restaurants-struggle-to-survive">as high as 40% </a>and very few tools to build customer loyalty. Based in Singapore, <a href="https://www.tablevibe.co/">Tablevibe</a> wants to help restaurants reduce their reliance on third-party delivery apps and help them get more direct orders and returning customers. The startup is part of Y Combinator’s current batch, which will hold its Demo Day at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Tablevibe’s founding team includes two former Googlers: Jeroen Rutten, formerly head of Google Search’s product strategy in APAC and Sneep, who was responsible for its app development go-to-market strategy and led large sales teams. They are joined by Guido Caldara, a lead teacher at coding bootcamp Le Wagon and Tablevibe’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>The idea for Tablevibe came after Rutten, its chief executive officer, visited a restaurant in Singapore that used paper feedback forms.</p>
<p>“We thought, if they use a paper feedback form, it actually creates a lot of hassle, like entering all the data into an Excel spreadsheet,” he told TechCrunch. “How’s the restaurant owner going to get actionable feedback based on data in an Excel spreadsheet?”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6NkVFr2jNN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/">The hidden cost of food delivery</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The hidden cost of food delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/embed/#?secret=6NkVFr2jNN" data-secret="6NkVFr2jNN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The team began working on the first version of Tablevibe, with simple Google Forms for dine-in customers and Google Data Studio dashboards, and tested it with three restaurants a few months before COVID-19 emerged. They found that using Tablevibe instead of paper forms increased response rates by up to 26x and also had the benefit of creating more repeat customers, since they are given an incentive for filling out surveys.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic hit and restaurants had to suddenly pivot to deliveries. The team kept the same idea behind their feedback forms, but started using QR codes affixed to takeout packaging. The QR codes (usually in the form of stickers so food and beverage businesses don’t need to order new packaging) also offer an incentive if customers scan it and fill out a survey—but the discount or free item can’t be redeemed through third-party delivery apps, only through direct orders with the restaurant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Restaurants can customize surveys, but about 80% use Tablevibe’s templates, which are quick to fill out, since most questions just ask for a rating from one to five stars (there’s also an optional form for customers to write their opinions). Customers fill out their name, email addresses, and then rank the food and atmosphere (for dine-in). For delivery, customers are also asked what app they used.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Easy Eat AI raises $5M to help Southeast Asian restaurants digitize their operations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/easy-eat-ai-raises-5m-to-help-southeast-asian-restaurants-digitize-their-operations/embed/#?secret=SwKAomiBjd" data-secret="SwKAomiBjd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tablevibe is integrated with Google Reviews, so if someone gives the restaurant a high rating, they are asked if they want to make it public. They also have the option to follow its Facebook or Instagram profile.</p>
<p>For dine-in customers, Tablevibe primarily works with F&amp;B businesses that have multiple venues, including Merci Marcel and Lo and Behold Group. For its delivery survey, most users are smaller restaurants that have one location. It also serves cloud kitchens, like CloudEats in the Philippines.</p>
<p>“As a restaurant, you want to own and grow your customer relationships,” said Sneep, Tablevibe’s chief operating officer. “The first part is actually knowing who your customers are, what they experienced and how you can contact them, which is how we can help. The second piece is growing a customer relationship, which we do by giving a reward, but only if a customer reorders directly with a restaurant.”</p>
<p>Customers have generated over 25,000 reviews through Tablevibe so far, which gives the company data to help determine what kind of incentives will convince someone to scan a restaurant’s QR code and take a survey.</p>
<p>Tablevibe’s founders say it can deliver more than 100x return on investment to its clients. For example, Merci Marcel did an evaluation and determined that it got a 103x ROI, based on the number of customers who claimed incentives, average order value, how many people left a five-star Google Review and how much more business those reviews drove to their venues.</p>
<p>The startup plans to expand into other English-speaking markets, focusing first on Northern Europe and then North America later this year. Aside from Singapore, it’s already used by customers in the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Portugal.</p>
<p>Rutten said that Tablevibe plans to build its development team, with the goal of becoming a “Salesforce for restaurants” that can help them build engagement through delivery or dine-ins, capture data and turn them into useful insights.</p>
<p>“Our roadmap has two levers—one is to get more data and the other is to provide more intelligence,” he said. “We’re working on API integrations so Tablevibe can integrate with point-of-sale systems. The second thing is to pull in more publicly available data from sources like Google Reviews. We will also build out more marketing features to leverage customer databases so businesses can send out emails about new restaurant launches, etc.” Eventually, Tablevibe also plans to use AI to help restaurants determine exactly what they need to do to improve customer experience, like change a menu item.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney&#8217;s streaming service is seeing improved growth, after initially <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-dis-2q-earnings-report-2021-11620852911?mod=article_inline">seeing slower numbers of subscriber additions</a> in Q2 as COVID lockdowns and mask mandates came to an end. Today, Disney+ beat analyst expectations for subscriber growth in Disney&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/12/disney-dis-fiscal-q3-2021-earnings.html">blowout third quarter</a>, reaching 116 million paid subscribers &#8212; above the 114.5 million Wall Street had expected &#8212; and up over 100% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Disney also topped expectations across the board, with $17.02 billion in revenue versus the $16.76 billion expected, and earnings per share of 80 cents, above analysts&#8217; expectations of 55 cents. Even <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-dis-3q-earnings-report-2021-11628736573">Disney Parks were back in business. </a></p>
<p>The pandemic had thrown a wrench in forecasting growth metrics across a number of industries, streaming included. Although Disney+ has well-established itself as one of the few competitors capable of challenging Netflix in an increasingly crowded market, it has seen some ups and downs due to COVID impacts. In the earlier days of the pandemic, streaming was on the rise. This March, Disney+ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-streaming-service-reaches-more-than-100-million-subscribers-11615319190?mod=article_inline">passed 100 million</a> subscribers after just 16 months of operation. At the time, Disney execs said the service was on track to meet its projections of 260 million subscribers by 2024.</p>
<p>But in Disney&#8217;s second-quarter earnings, the economy&#8217;s re-opening impacted Disney+ numbers, as people finally had more to do than just sit at home, and vaccinations become more widely available. Then, Disney+ only <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-103-6-million-subscribers-1234972672/">reached</a> 103.6 million subscribers, when analysts were expecting 109.3 million, and the stock slipped as a result.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scarlett Johansson files suit over Disney+ ‘Black Widow’ release&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/scarlett-johansson-files-suit-over-disney-black-widow-release/embed/#?secret=xzM4Cx88k2" data-secret="xzM4Cx88k2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Disney wasn&#8217;t alone in feeling the impacts of COVID-induced lumpiness in subscriber additions. Netflix had also seen slower subscriber growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/netflix-q1-2021/">earlier in the year due</a> to COVID and its far-reaching effects on things like production delays and release schedules.</p>
<p>But Netflix&#8217;s most recent quarter, where it once again topped subscriber estimates, had <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/26/why-netflix-q2-earnings-subscriber-growth-disney/">hinted that Disney+</a> may see a similar boost. Aiding in that growth was Disney+&#8217;s recent market expansions in Asia. Disney+ Hotstar arrived in Malaysia and Thailand in June after prior launches in India and Indonesia last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Hotstar version of Disney+, however, led to lowered average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) in the quarter due to its lower price points. In Q3, ARPU declined from $4.62 to $4.16 due to a higher mix of Disney+ Hotstar subscribers compared with the prior-year quarter, Disney said.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s other streaming services, Hulu and ESPN+, didn&#8217;t see the same trend.</p>
<p>Hulu&#8217;s subscription video service jumped from $11.39 to $13.15 year-over-year and its Live TV service (+SVOD) grew from $68.11 to $84.09. ESPN+ also grew from $4.18 to $4.47.</p>
<p>Subscriber growth also increased across the services, with ESPN+ growing 75% year-over-year to reach 14.9 million customers and total Hulu subscribers growing 21% to reach 42.8 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Our direct-to-consumer business is performing very well, with a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu at the end of the quarter, and a host of new content coming to the platform,&#8221; noted Disney CEO Bob Chapek in a <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/08/q3-fy21-earnings.pdf">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Across Disney&#8217;s direct-to-consumer business, revenues grew 57% to $4.3 billion and its operating loss declined from $0.6 billion to $0.3 billion, thanks to improved results from Hulu, including subscription growth and higher ad revenues.</p>
<p>These gains were offset by a higher loss at Disney+ attributed to programming, production, marketing and technology costs that were somewhat mitigated by increases in subscription revenues and success of the Disney+ Premier Access release of &#8220;Cruella.&#8221; (Disney&#8217;s fiscal quarter ended July 3, so the impacts of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/black-widow-disney-box-office/">massive haul</a> that &#8220;Black Widow&#8221; saw following its U.S. opening &#8212; nor the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/scarlett-johansson-files-suit-over-disney-black-widow-release/">resulting lawsuit from star Scarlett Johansson,</a> for that matter &#8212; have yet to be included in these figures.)</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 12, 2021. A few things to kick us off: First, the worlds of politics and technology are increasingly butting heads. We’re not talking about China or India (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-locks-account-of-india-congress-largest-opposition-party/">more here on the latter</a>), though both countries have picked fights in recent months with tech firms foreign and domestic. This time it’s Zambia, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/whatsapp-and-other-social-media-platforms-restricted-in-zambia-amidst-ongoing-elections/">restricting WhatsApp and other services within its borders</a>. A trend to watch.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/seth-rogen-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-to-talk-about-the-weed-business/">Seth Rogen is coming to Disrupt!</a> &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/"><strong>Governments challenge app stores:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The United States Senate, the upper chamber of our bicameral Congress, is chewing on a new bill that would “require companies that control operating systems to allow third-party apps and app stores,” per TechCrunch. The chances that this bill passes as-is are low, but the fact that it exists details the regulatory climate that tech finds itself in today.</li>

Investors:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The saga of former startup-darling Box taking on an activist shareholder group took a new turn today with the enterprise productivity company releasing its earnings early. Why? Box had some reasonably good news to report, and there’s a vote underway. It wanted its results out to help control the narrative. We have the numbers for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/"><strong>Reddit is raising $700M:</strong></a> Social giant Reddit has put together $410 million of a larger round to help fuel its long-term ambitions. The company did around $100 million in Q2 revenue and will be worth $6 billion after it closes its latest round. It’s a lot of capital for an internet property that was once <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/10/31/breaking-news-conde-nastwired-acquires-reddit/">sold to Conde Nast</a> for a sum that we are 99.99% sure was but a fraction of its current worth.</li>

Aalto just landed $13 million from Sequoia to help folks sell their properties directly to buyers. That’s one way to cut costs.</li>

The company is now worth $1.33 billion after its latest round, implying a pre-money valuation of $1.2 billion.

<h2>Disaster recovery can be an effective way to ease into the cloud</h2>
<p>Given the rapid pace of digital transformation, nearly every business will eventually migrate some — or most — aspects of their operations to the cloud.</p>
<p>Before making the wholesale shift to digital, companies can start getting comfortable by using disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS). Even a partially managed DRaaS can make an organization more resilient and lighten the load for its IT team.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s a savvy way for tech leaders to get shot-callers inside their companies to get on board the cloud bandwagon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Both companies were heavily impacted by the onset of COVID-19: Airbnb saw its revenues collapse in 2020, while DoorDash managed a simply incredible 2020 as folks stayed home and ordered in.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Home-stay giant Airbnb and on-demand delivery concern DoorDash reported their quarterly results today after the bell.</p>
<p>Both companies were heavily impacted by the onset of COVID-19. Airbnb saw its revenues collapse in 2020 during early lockdowns, leading the company to raise expensive capital and batten its hatches. The company recovered as the year continued, leading to its eventual IPO.</p>
<p>DoorDash, in contrast, managed a simply incredible 2020 as folks stayed home and ordered in. Given that we got both reports on the same day, let&#8217;s digest &#8217;em and see how COVID has &#8212; and may &#8212; impact their results.</p>
<h2>Airbnb&#8217;s Q2</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Airbnb_Q2-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf">the second quarter</a>, Airbnb reported revenues of $1.3 billion, which compares favorably with its Q2 2020 result of $335 million and its 2019 Q2 revenue total of $1.21 billion. In percentage terms, Airbnb&#8217;s revenue grew 299% from its Q2 2020 level and 10% from what the company managed during the same period of 2019.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected $1.23 billion in revenue for the period.</p>
<p>Airbnb lost $68 million in the quarter when counting all costs. The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA, a heavily modified profit metric, came to $217 million in the quarter. Cash from operations in Q2 2021 was $791 million. Looking ahead, here&#8217;s what Airbnb had to say regarding its revenue outlook:</p>
<blockquote><p>[We] expect Q3 2021 revenue to be our strongest quarterly revenue on record and to deliver the highest Adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>How did the market digest Airbnb&#8217;s better-than-expected growth, rising adjusted profit, falling net losses, massive cash generation and expectations of record Q3 revenue? By bidding its shares lower. Airbnb is off around 4.5% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Confused? Investors may be worried about the following note from the company, also from the guidance section of its earnings letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the near term, we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 and the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus, including the Delta variant, will continue to affect overall travel behavior, including how often and when guests book and cancel. As a result, year-over-year comparisons for Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV will continue to be more volatile and non-linear.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Q3 2021 is looking great for Airbnb, it appears that its future growth could be lumpy or delayed thanks to the ongoing pandemic. There are public indicators pointing to travel rates declining, which could impact Airbnb.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s Q2 results and Q3 anticipations are impressive when compared to where Airbnb was a year ago. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is entirely out of the COVID woods.</p>

<h2>DoorDash&#8217;s Q2</h2>
<p>Despite generally lower COVID friction in its market during Q2 2021, DoorDash <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf">managed to set records</a> for orders and the value of those orders. In the three-month period concluding June 30, 2021, the on-demand food delivery company turned $10.46 billion in order value (marketplace GOV) into $1.24 billion in total revenue. The marketplace GOV number was 70% greater than the Q2 2020 result, while DoorDash&#8217;s revenues expanded by 83%.</p>
<p>Investors had expected the company to post $1.08 billion in total revenues, so DoorDash handily bested expectations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="L4Mx51hvw2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/">How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=L4Mx51hvw2" data-secret="L4Mx51hvw2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>How profitable was DoorDash during the quarter? DoorDash was unprofitable overall, with a net loss of $102 million. In adjusted EBITDA terms, DoorDash saw $113 million in profit during Q2 2021. That&#8217;s not too bad, given that Uber cannot manage the same feat with its own food delivery business. DoorDash&#8217;s net income was worse than what it managed in Q2 2020, while its adjusted EBITDA improved.</p>
<p>Shares of DoorDash are off around 3.5% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Why? It&#8217;s not entirely clear. DoorDash said that it expects &#8220;Q3 Marketplace GOV to be in a range of $9.3 billion to $9.8 billion, with Q3 Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $0 million to $100 million.&#8221; Sure, that&#8217;s down a smidgen from its Q2 GOV number, but investors were anticipating DoorDash to post less revenue in Q3 than Q2, so you would think that GOV expectations were also more modest.</p>
<p>Is COVID the answer? Mentions of COVID-19 in the company&#8217;s earnings document tend to deal with trailing results and historical efforts to provide relief to restaurants that use DoorDash for orders or delivery. So, there&#8217;s not a lot of juice to squeeze there. However, the company did say the following toward the end of its report:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the broad secular shift toward omni-channel local commerce remains nascent. However, the scale and fragmentation of local commerce suggests the problems to be solved will get more difficult, coordination between internal and external stakeholders will become more complex, and vectors for competitive threats will increase. At the same time, we expect the pace of consumer behavioral shifts to slow compared to the extraordinary pace of change in recent quarters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simplifying that for us: DoorDash expects slower growth in the future, a more complex business climate and rising competition as it enters new markets. That&#8217;s not a mix that would make any investor <em>more</em> excited, we don&#8217;t think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Nothing launched the Ear (1) with a grand idea: earbuds as fashion accessories. Sure, the company talked a lot about the non-invasiveness of transparent design, but at the end of the day, the product’s launch on StockX betrayed a focus on the fashion forward.</p>
<p>In that respect, Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds 2 are the anti-Nothing. They’re almost aggressively unassuming in their approach. It’s in keeping with previous generations of Buds, but still in stark &#8212; and refreshing &#8212; contrast for a company that prides itself on creating some of the world’s most ostentatious smartphones. Look no further than the two (!) new foldables launched along with the headphones at the Unpacked event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Samsung’s almost casual approach to its headphones is something of a mixed blessing. The company could certainly be clearer with the branding of what seems to be an ever-shifting lineup of models. I asked for clarification of how things break down ahead of this week’s launch, and the company responded thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our premium offering, the Galaxy Buds Pro leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver immersive audio, intelligent Active noise cancelling, and effortless connectivity. For those looking to show off their unique style, the Galaxy Buds Live combine high quality sound with an eye-catching design.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2189203" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189203" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189203" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9943.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189203" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>So, the short answer is there are three versions of Galaxy Buds on the market: Buds 2, Buds Pro and Buds Live. The above quote should confirm any suspicion you may have had that the new $149 version of the entry-level Buds make the $170 Buds Live Buds more or less redundant. Barring some major upgrade, they’re probably not long for this world, leaving a clearer two-level offering of the Buds 2 and the higher-end Buds Pro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I’ve mentioned this before &#8212; the world of wireless earbuds were quick to reach a consensus of “pretty good.” Frankly, you’d have to go out of your way to find a bad pair for over $100. And for many or most intents and purposes, I’m inclined to recommend people go with a pair made by the company that made their phone. There’s a definite market advantage in having direct access to a device’s hardware and software.</p>
<p>That, of course, is a decided advantage for a company with as massive a global market share as Samsung. And the Galaxy Buds 2 are the epitome of “pretty good” in the pretty good way. They’re not flashy, and with a design that’s 15% smaller and 20% lighter than the already compact original Galaxy Buds, they’re designed to practically disappear, with minimal surface area exposed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189205" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189205" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189205" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9938.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189205" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The size and shape makes for an extremely comfortable pair of buds. I’m not sure why I’m blessed with the gift of ear pain with roughly half of the earbuds I try out, but these are ergonomic and designed for the long haul. There’s enough surface area to access the touch control on the exposed side. The biggest downside to the small size is there’s really no way to adjust them in your ear without accidentally triggering that touch. That became a nuisance when I constantly found myself adjusting them to deal with sweaty ears during a run &#8212; a bad time to have to worry about dealing with music controls.</p>
<p>The sound is solid, courtesy of Samsung subsidiary AKG. Not exceptional, but pretty much exactly what you need/want out of a pair of $149 buds. I was impressed with the active noise canceling, as well. A perfectly good, totally unexceptional experience &#8212; utilitarian, really. Again: in a good way. If better sound is a must, the Pros are an easy upgrade &#8212; or else, there’s Nura’s new buds or Sony’s, depending on how lavish you want get. The Buds Pro also bring features like 360 Audio &#8212; which is likely only a make-or-break for an exceedingly small number of potential buyers.</p>

<p>Wireless charging for the case is a welcome touch, which along with ANC, catapults them above a number of other entry-level pairs. The battery is rated five hours with ANC and 7.5 with it off. The glassy little case bumps that up to a respectable 20 hours. The IPX2 water resistance, meanwhile, is good for sweat, but otherwise can be added to the list of things the company can improve next around.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a pretty short list, however. The Galaxy Buds 2 are solid, unassuming and an easy addition for those in the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Operating in the cloud is soon going to be a reality for many businesses whether they like it or not. Points of contention with this shift often arise from unfamiliarity and discomfort with cloud operations. However, cloud migrations don&#8217;t have to be a full lift and shift.</p>
<p>Instead, leaders unfamiliar with the cloud should start by moving over their disaster recovery program to the cloud, which helps to gain familiarity and understanding before a full migration of production workloads.</p>
<h2>What is DRaaS?</h2>
<p>Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) is cloud-based disaster recovery delivered as a service to organizations in a self-service, partially managed or fully managed service model. The agility of DR in the cloud affords businesses a geographically diverse location to failover operations and run as close to normal as possible following a disruptive event. DRaaS emphasizes speed of recovery so that this failover is as seamless as possible. Plus, technology teams can offload some of the more burdensome aspects of maintaining and testing their disaster recovery.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to disaster recovery testing, allow for extra time to let your IT staff learn the ins and outs of the cloud environment.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>DRaaS is a perfect candidate for a first step into the cloud for five main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using DRaaS helps leaders get accustomed to the ins and outs of cloud before conducting a full production shift.</li>
<li>Testing cycles of the DRaaS solution allows IT teams to see firsthand how their applications will operate in a cloud environment, enabling them to identify the applications that will need a full or partial refactor before migrating to the cloud.</li>
<li>With DRaaS, technology leaders can demonstrate an early win in the cloud without risking full production.</li>
<li>DRaaS success helps gain full buy-in from stakeholders, board members and executives.</li>
<li>The replication tools that DRaaS uses are sometimes the same tools used to migrate workloads for production environments — this helps the technology team practice their cloud migration strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps to start your DRaaS journey to the cloud</h2>
<h3>Define your strategy</h3>
<p>Do your research to determine if DRaaS is right for you given your long-term organizational goals. You don’t want to start down a path to one cloud environment if that cloud isn’t aligned with your company’s objectives, both for the short and long term. Having cross-functional conversations among business units and with company executives will assist in defining and iterating your strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Medal.tv, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/looking-to-become-the-meme-based-social-network-of-the-gaming-world-medal-tv-raises-9-million/">short-form video clipping service</a> and social network for gamers, is entering the livestreaming market with the acquisition of Rawa.tv, a Twitch rival based in Dubai, which had raised around $1 million to date. The seven-figure, all-cash deal will see two of Rawa&#8217;s founders, Raya Dadah and Phil Jammal, now joining Medal, and further integrations between the two platforms going forward.</p>
<p>The Middle East and North African region (MENA) is one of the fastest-growing markets in gaming and still one that&#8217;s mostly un-catered to, explained Medal.tv CEO Pim de Witte, as to his company&#8217;s interest in Rawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most companies that target that market don&#8217;t really understand the nuances and try to replicate existing Western or Far-Eastern models that are doomed to fail,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Absorbing a local team will increase Medal&#8217;s chances of success here. Overall, we believe that MENA is an underserved market without a clear leader in the livestreaming space, and Rawa brings to Medal the local market expertise that we need to capitalize on this opportunity,&#8221; de Witte added.</p>
<p>Medal.tv&#8217;s community had been asking for the ability to do livestreaming for some time, the exec also noted, but the technology would have been too expensive for the startup to build using off-the-shelf services at its scale, de Witte said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People increasingly connect around live and real-time experiences, and this is something our platform has lacked to date,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>But Rawa, as the first livestreaming platform dedicated to Arab gaming, had built out its own proprietary live and network streaming technology that&#8217;s now used in all its products. That technology is now coming to Medal.tv.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189410" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189410" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rawa.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Medal.tv</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies were already connected before today, as Rawa users have been able to upload their gaming clips to Medal.tv, and some Rawa partners had joined Medal&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/medal-tv/skilled-player-program-announcement-4e7117529b7b">skilled player program</a>. Going forward, Rawa will continue to operate as a separate platform, but it will become more tightly integrated with Medal, the company says. Currently, Rawa sees around 100,000 active users on its service.</p>
<p>The remaining Rawa team will continue to operate the livestreaming platform under co-founder Jammal&#8217;s leadership following the deal&#8217;s close, and the Rawa HQ will remain based in Dubai. However, Rawa&#8217;s employees have been working remotely since the start of the pandemic, and it&#8217;s unclear if that will change in the future, given the uncertainty of COVID-19&#8217;s spread.</p>
<p>Medal.tv detailed its further plans for Rawa <a href="https://medaltv.notion.site/Medal-tv-has-acquired-Rawa-tv-Live-Content-is-Coming-to-Medal-8c8ad704836a4dd9a91aabfd00114e7d">on its site</a>, where the company explained it doesn&#8217;t aim to build a &#8220;general-purpose&#8221; livestreaming platform where the majority of viewers don&#8217;t pay &#8212; a call-out that clearly seems aimed at Twitch. Instead, it says it will focus on matching content with viewers who would be interested in subscribing to the creators. This addresses one of the challenges that has faced larger platforms like Twitch in the past, where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17569520/twitch-streamers-zero-viewers-motivation-community">it&#8217;s been difficult for smaller streamers to get off the ground</a>.</p>
<p>The company also said it will remain narrowly focused on serving the gaming community as opposed to venturing into non-gaming content, as others have done. Again, this differentiates itself from Twitch which, over the years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/15/twitch-opens-to-vloggers-with-launch-of-irl-mobile-broadcasting-to-come-next-year/">expanded</a> into vlogs and even streaming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/after-pulling-in-5-6m-viewers-twitch-is-keeping-bob-ross-on-the-air/">old TV shows.</a> And it&#8217;s much different from YouTube or Facebook Watch, where gaming is only a subcategory of a broader video network.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows Medal.tv&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/looking-to-become-the-meme-based-social-network-of-the-gaming-world-medal-tv-raises-9-million/">$9 million Series A</a> led by Horizons Ventures in 2019, after the startup had grown to 5 million registered users and &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of daily active users. Today, the company says over 200,000 people create content every day on Medal, and 3 million users are actively viewing that content every month.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The unprecedented liquidity that has entered the venture market in the past year has spurred several trends that require VCs to adapt to a more competitive environment where startup founders have far more leverage than they did in the past.</p>
<p>Structurally, there are only so many startups looking to raise capital, and even though some founders may be opportunistically pursuing deals they wouldn’t have previously, the supply of capital into venture funds has nonetheless outpaced the demand for those dollars.</p>
<p>This means VCs are in an unusual environment of increasing competition to get in on deals with startups, and as they jockey to win spots on cap tables they’re moving faster than ever to close deals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The best early-stage VCs take the time to find the founders they believe in and who need their expertise, because they’ll be right there working with them for the long haul.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, newcomers in the VC market like Tiger Global as well as a number of non-VC investment funds like PE firms with much larger pools of capital than the market has seen are aggressively pursuing enormous deals in an effort to drive faster exits and returns on their investments.</p>
<p>With so many investors vying for their attention, many founders are taking the opportunity to raise bigger rounds and coming back for additional funding faster than ever, which is apparent in the constant drumbeat of funding news as well as the 250 unicorns and the record $288 billion invested in startups in the first half of this year.</p>
<h2>How can VCs adapt and be competitive?</h2>
<p>For some, the answer may be moving faster to get in on deals. Strategies like doing more due diligence in advance of ever meeting startups and leveraging technologies like AI to supplement investors’ ability to evaluate companies can help with this. For others, it may be making larger investments and accepting smaller ownership stakes in startups than they’re accustomed to.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">Lowercarbon Capital</a>, a climate-tech focused fund founded by longtime investor Chris Sacca and his wife Crystal Sacca, has closed on $800 million in capital, Sacca <a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/2021/08/12/cash-cools-everything-around-me/">announced today</a> in a post on the firm&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>According to Sacca, the commitments came exceedingly fast &#8212; in &#8220;just a few days.&#8221; Writes Sacca: &#8220;It turns out that raising for a climate fund in the context of an unprecedented heatwave and from behind the thick clouds of fire smoke probably didn’t hurt. In fact, all that pollution may have lent a warm, beautifying haze to our Zoom calls. Like an Incendiary Doom Glow Insta filter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interest is far from surprising given the mounting and rather stark evidence that life as humans know it is in peril, owing to rising temperatures. On the heels of a deadly floods in Western Germany and China, wildfires in Greece and California, and in advance of yet another heat wave for which people in the Pacific Northwest are currently bracing, a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">new report</a> released Monday by the United Nations’ climate science research group was clear about the current state of affairs, declaring a &#8220;code red for humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, some of Lowercarbon&#8217;s backers are interested in tech that&#8217;s working to reverse some of these trends. But as Sacca notes, if they&#8217;re purely focused on the financial rewards that climate-focused tech can reap, that&#8217;s fine, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to see how many investors understand the urgency of the climate crisis and are already dedicating their time, as well as their capital, to real solutions,&#8221; he says in his post. &#8220;However, to be frank, we were also heartened by those investors who actually don’t care that much about the planet and instead are just chasing financial returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowercarbon&#8217;s very thesis is that &#8220;massive change will happen because these types of investments will pay off for sheer business reasons alone,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>In addition to the Saccas, Lowercarbon is being run by Clay Dumas, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based partner who the firm describes as its most active investor. Though the Harvard grad hasn&#8217;t been in the venture world long &#8212; first joining up with Sacca in 2017 to join his earlier firm Lowercase Capital as a partner &#8212; he understands the world of politics in a way that few, more &#8220;traditional&#8221; VCs, might.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After opening a field office for the campaign to elect Barack Obama in 2008, he went on to serve as an aide in the White House to the-then Deputy Chief of Staff and later worked (again in the White House) for the  Office of Digital Strategy.</p>
<p>Lowercarbon&#8217;s many dozens of bets to date include Heart Aerospace, a three-year-old, Göteborg, Sweden-based startup at work on an electric regional airliner to which the firm wrote a seed check (and more recently wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/heart-aerospace-raises-35m-series-a-lands-order-with-united-and-mesa-airlines-for-200-aircraft/">follow-on check</a>); Holy Grail, a two-year-old, Mountain View, Ca.-based startup that&#8217;s prototyping a direct air carbon capture device that is modular and small (it announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/holy-grail-raises-2-7m-seed-fund-to-create-modular-carbon-capture-devices/">seed funding</a> in June); and Cervest, a six-year-old, London-based climate risk platform that says it provides commercial and government entities access to current, historic, and predictive views about how combined weather risks can impact the assets they own. The last raised <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/london-based-climate-intelligence-platform-cervest-secures-30-million-in-series-a-round/">$30 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Sacca, who became well-known for his early and outsize bets on both Twitter and Uber, was somewhat famously a judge on the popular TV show &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; for several seasons before quitting the show &#8212; and venture capital &#8212; in 2017, saying he had always intended to retire at age 40. (At the time, he was 42.)</p>
<p>Sacca&#8217;s growing concern regarding climate change &#8212; and his lack of faith that politicians can make a dent in reversing it &#8212; prompted him to rethink that decision. As he <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/10/chris-sacca-talks-biden-crypto-nft-climate-startups/?sh=2c074b6b5198">told Forbes</a> in March: &#8220;We think that markets might actually hold the key to unf***ing the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.axios.com/chris-sacca-clean-energy-venture-capital-dde84900-5b80-4443-b662-1f2f8cdfa809.html">Axios report</a> from June of last year, Lowercarbon was originally structured as a family office with tens of millions of dollars to deploy. As of the middle of last year, the only outside money it had accepted was for a &#8220;few special-purpose vehicles with institutional investors from Sacca&#8217;s prior funds,&#8221; the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Now, with a fresh $800 million to invest &#8212; the capital will be divided into four funds &#8212; Sacca &amp; Co. appear to be fully back to work. In fact, we&#8217;ll be talking with Sacca next month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>; to hear what&#8217;s top of mind for him right now, you won&#8217;t want to miss that conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With two giants calling the shots and collecting whatever tolls they see fit, mobile software makers have long complained that app stores take an unfair cut of the cash that should be flowing directly to developers. Hearing those concerns, a group of senators introduced a new bill this week that, if passed, would greatly diminish Apple and Google&#8217;s ability to control app purchases in their operating systems and completely shake up the way that mobile software gets distributed.</p>
<p>The new bill, called <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf">the Open App Markets Act</a>, would enshrine quite a few rights that could benefit app developers tired of handing 30% of their earnings to Apple and Google. The bill, embedded in full below, would require companies that control operating systems to allow third-party apps and app stores.</p>
<p>It would also prevent those companies from blocking developers from telling users about lower prices for their software that they might find outside of official app stores. Apple and Google would also be barred from leveraging &#8220;non-public&#8221; information collecting through their platforms to create competing apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This legislation will tear down coercive anticompetitive walls in the app economy, giving consumers more choices and smaller startup tech companies a fighting chance,&#8221; said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who introduced the bipartisan bill with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Klobuchar chairs the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee and Blackburn and Blumenthal are both subcommittee members.</p>
<p>Senator Blackburn called Apple and Google&#8217;s app store practices a &#8220;direct affront to a free and fair marketplace&#8221; and Sen. Klobuchar noted that their behavior raises &#8220;serious competition concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/519922659/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-8egZfKyFWBMht6E2ep5m"  data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_519922659" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		<div style="font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%"><a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/519922659" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">View this document on Scribd</a></div></p>
<p>The bill draws on information collected earlier this year from that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">subcommittee&#8217;s hearing on app stores and competition</a>. In the hearing, lawmakers heard from Apple and Google as well as Spotify, Tile and Match Group, three companies that argued their businesses have been negatively impacted by anti-competitive app store policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; We urge Congress to swiftly pass the Open App Markets Act,&#8221; Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said of the new bill. &#8220;Absent action, we can expect Apple and others to continue changing the rules in favor of their own services, and causing further harm to consumers, developers and the digital economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/coalition-for-app-fairness-a-group-fighting-for-app-store-reforms-adds-20-new-partners/">Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a developer advocacy group, praised the bill for its potential to spur innovation in digital markets. &#8220;The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world,&#8221; CAF executive director Meghan DiMuzio said.</p>
<p>Hoping to head off future regulatory headaches, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">dropped its own fees</a> for companies that generate less than $1 million in App Store revenue from 30% to 15% last year. Google followed suit with its own gesture, dropping fees to 15% for the first $1 million in revenue a developer earns through the Play Store in a year. Some developers critical of the companies&#8217; practices saw those changes as little more than a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>Developers have long complained about the high tolls they pay to distribute their software through the world&#8217;s two major mobile operating systems. That fight escalated over the last year when Epic Games circumvented Apple&#8217;s payments rules by allowing Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, setting off a legal fight that has huge implications for the mobile software world. Following a May trial, the verdict is expected later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will make it easier for developers of all sizes to challenge these harmful practices and seek relief from retaliation, be it during litigation or simply because they dared speak up,&#8221; Epic Games VP of Public Policy Corie Wright said of the new bill.</p>

<p>Unlike Apple, Google does allow apps to be &#8220;sideloaded,&#8221; installed onto devices outside of the Google Play Store. But documents <a href="https://gizmodo.com/even-google-thinks-a-apps-on-android-is-a-hor-1847440852">unsealed in Epic&#8217;s parallel case against Google</a> revealed that the Play Store&#8217;s creator knows the sideloading process is a terrible experience for users — something the company brings up when pressuring developers to stick with its official app marketplace.</p>
<p>The counterargument here is that official app stores make apps safer and smoother for consumers. While Apple and Google extract heavy fees for selling mobile software through the App Store and the Google Play Store, the companies both argue that streamlining apps through those official channels protects people from malware and allows for prompt software updates to patch security concerns that could jeopardize user privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Apple, our focus is on maintaining an App Store where people can have confidence that every app must meet our rigorous guidelines and their privacy and security is protected,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Adam Kovacevich, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/04/30/leaked-google-email-reveals-ties-to-new-pro-tech-group-794997">former Google policy executive</a> who leads the new tech-backed industry group Chamber of Progress, called the new bill &#8220;a finger in the eye&#8221; for Android and iPhone owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t see any consumers marching in Washington demanding that Congress make their smartphones dumber,&#8221; Kovacevich said. &#8220;And Congress has better things to do than intervene in a multi-million-dollar dispute between businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least in Google&#8217;s case, the counterargument has its own counterargument. Android has long been notorious for malware, but apparently most of that malicious software <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/play-store-identified-as-main-distribution-vector-for-most-android-malware/">isn&#8217;t making its way onto devices through sideloading</a> — it&#8217;s walking through the Google Play Store&#8217;s front door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> has been in an ongoing dispute with activist investors <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">control of the board</a>, an argument that is expected to come to a head on September 9th at the annual shareholder meeting. In an effort to show shareholders that the numbers are continuing to improve under the current leadership, Box took the unusual move of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210812005313/en/Box-Announces-Preliminary-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results">releasing its earning report</a> this morning, two weeks ahead of the expected August 25th report date.</p>
<p>Companies don&#8217;t normally report ahead of schedule, but perhaps Box sees the opportunity to do some lobbying, or conversely, to counter any negative lobbying that Starboard may be doing with its fellow investors ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that in spite of the meeting being on September 9th, like a lot of voting these days, people will be sending in votes throughout this month, ahead of that day. Box wants to get its latest financial information out there sooner rather than later to catch those early voters before they cast their ballots.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Box and CEO Aaron Levie, the numbers look decent.</p>
<h2>Earnings</h2>
<p>It’s not hard to see why Box released its earnings early, as the numbers provide an argument for keeping the company’s current leadership in place.</p>
<p>In the three-month period ending July 31, 2021 &#8212; the second quarter of Box’s fiscal 2022 &#8212; the company generated $214 million in revenue, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And, as Box is quick to point out, its second consecutive quarter of “accelerating revenue growth.” The company bested its own guidance of $211 to $212 million in revenue for the period.</p>
<p>It matters that Box is showing an ability to accelerate its revenue growth. First, because doing so puts wind in the sales of its stock; quickly growing companies are worth more per dollar of revenue than more slowly growing concerns, and accelerating revenue growth over time is investor catnip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Activist investor Starboard Value makes official bid for Box board seats in letter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/embed/#?secret=HEdV7gPjLX" data-secret="HEdV7gPjLX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The accelerating pace of growth over the last half year also provides footing for Box’s leadership to argue that their product choices have been sound, directly supporting their positions that they should remain in charge of the company. If they made good product decisions quarters ago, and those choices are leading to accelerating revenue growth, why swap out the CEO?</p>
<p>Box had more quarterly good news apart from its revenue numbers to disclose. It also reported improved GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins &#8212; a key measure of profitability &#8212; better billings results than it had previously anticipated for the period. Box’s net retention rate also expanded to 106% from 103% in the sequentially preceding period.</p>
<p>And the company boosted its guidance for its fiscal year from “$845 million to $853 million” to “$856 million to $860 million.”</p>
<p>The counter arguments are somewhat easy to generate, however. Yes, Box’s revenue growth is accelerating, but from an admittedly reduced base; it’s not as hard to accelerate revenue expansion from low numbers as it is from higher base levels. And the company’s net retention is lower than what any business-focused SaaS company would want to report.</p>
<p>Will the good news be enough? Shares of Box are up around 1.5% in today’s regular trading, despite a somewhat mixed overall market. Investors now have to vote with more than just their dollars.</p>
<h2>Boardroom context</h2>
<p>Starboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">bought approximately 7.5% of the company</a> in 2019, and actually stayed fairly quiet for the first year, but at the end of 2020 it started making itself heard with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">rumors of pressure</a> to sell the company. In what appeared to be a defensive move, Box <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">took a $500 million investment</a> from private equity firm KKR and gave the investor a board seat in April.</p>
<p>The activist investor did not take kindly to that move, <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_Box_Stockholders_05.03.2021.pdf">writing in a letter to investors in early May</a>, &#8220;The only viable explanation for this financing is a shameless and utterly transparent attempt to “buy the vote” and shows complete disregard for proper corporate governance and fiscal discipline.&#8221; In that same letter, Starboard made it official that it wanted to take over several board seats, outlining a litany of complaints it had about the way the company was being run. It also made clear that it wanted co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie gone or the company sold.</p>

<p>Box pushed back that the letter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">another on May 10th</a> did not accurately reflect the progress that the company had made. In July, Box took the battle public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">in an SEC filing detailing the back and forth</a> dance that had been going between Box and Starboard since it bought its stake in the company</p>
<p>So far, the cloud content management company has staved off all attempts to force its hand and sell the company or fire Levie, but this is all going to culminate with the shareholder&#8217;s vote. It&#8217;s truly a battle for the soul of the company.</p>
<p>If Starboard convinces shareholders to give it several seats on the Box board, it would probably be able to push out Levie, take control of the company and likely sell it to the highest bidder. The early financial report released today, while not exactly stellar, shows a pattern of increasingly good quarters, and that&#8217;s what Box is hoping voters will focus on when they fill out their ballots.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’m frequently asked by journalists whether I think venture capital valuations are too high in the current environment.</p>
<p>Because the average venture capital fund returns only 1.3x committed capital over the course of a decade, according to the last reported data from Cambridge Associates, and 1.5x, according to PitchBook, I believe the answer is a resounding “yes.”</p>
<p>So when entrepreneurs use unicorn aspirations to pump private company valuations, how can investors plan for a decent return?</p>
<p>At the growth stage, we can easily apply traditional financial metrics to venture capital valuations. By definition, everything is fairly predictable, so price-to-revenue and industry multiples make for easy math.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For starters, venture capitalists need to stop engaging in self-delusion about why a valuation that is too high might be OK.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But at the seed and early stages, <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/its-a-trap-3b6bb185eb61?source=friends_link&amp;sk=43952d63b99b72a30d51db57867a0964">when forecasting is nearly impossible</a>, what tools can investors apply to make pricing objective, disciplined and fair for both sides?</p>
<p>For starters, venture capitalists need to stop engaging in self-delusion about why a valuation that is too high might be OK. Here are three common lies we tell ourselves as investors to rationalize a potentially undisciplined valuation decision.</p>
<h2>Lie 1 : The devil made me do it</h2>
<p>If a big-name VC thinks the price is OK, it must be a good deal, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>While the lead investor who set the price may be experienced, there are many reasons why the price she set may not be justified. The lead may be an “inside” investor already, committing small amounts or  —  believe it or not  —  simply not care.</p>
<p>Insiders are investors who have previously placed capital in the startup. They face a conflict of interest because they are rooting for the success of the startup and generally want the company’s stock price to keep growing to show momentum.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many venture capitalists prefer not to lead subsequent rounds: Pricing decisions can no longer be objective because investors are effectively on both sides of the table at the same time.</p>
<p>Inside-led rounds happen all the time for good reasons  —  including making a funding process fast so that management can focus on building the business  —  but because these decisions are not at arm&#8217;s length, they cannot be trusted as an objective indicator of market value. Only a test of the open market or an independent third-party valuation can accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>It’s also the case that a relatively small investment can relax pricing discipline in some firms. If a funding amount represents 1% of the fund size or less, it’s possible that the VC team may view the investment as “putting a marker down” and not worry about whether the price offers an attractive multiple. For this reason, it’s a good idea to check the lead investor’s check size against the overall size of the firm’s latest fund.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why investors may not care about the valuation. Some VCs are “logo hunters” who just want to be able to say they were investors in a particular company. If you outsource valuation discipline to a lead investor who doesn’t value financial results, your own returns may suffer.</p>
<h2>Lie 2:  We are getting a deal because the price is flat from the last round</h2>
<p>If the last round valuation was $50 million and the current round valuation is about the same, we tell ourselves it’s gotta be a good deal.</p>
<p>Again, this is faulty thinking, because the last round’s price might have been too high.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A short decade after<a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"> software started eating the world</a>, along came headlines about <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/21/every-company-will-be-a-fintech-company/">every company becoming a fintech</a> thanks to innovation and growth in embedded finance business models.</p>
<p>This narrative oversimplifies the evolution that’s happening in the financial services sector. Storing and moving money and extending credit in a regulated environment is difficult. And differentiating your offering from incumbent financial institutions requires much more than superficial tweaks.</p>
<p>What really makes a fintech company extends far beyond user interface enhancements and delivering financial services to end customers. It’s what’s “under the hood” &#8212; the full-stack approach that allows fintech companies to truly innovate for their customers.</p>

		<blockquote>
			What really makes a fintech company extends far beyond user interface enhancements and delivering financial services to end customers.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Embedded finance helps companies and brands outside of the core financial sector distribute financial services. This requires varying levels of effort from the company and looks like anything from Starbucks offering an integrated wallet and payments within its app to Lyft offering a debit card to their drivers. But that doesn’t make Starbucks or Lyft fintech companies.</p>
<h2>The fallacy behind the hype</h2>
<p>The “every company will be a fintech” stance investors are bullish on conflates multiple approaches to inlaying financial offerings, coupling the resurgence of white-labeled financial services (which have been around for decades) with the rising banking, payments and lending-as-a-service players. The latter approach allows companies to customize their financial product experience while outsourcing many core financial services tasks. The former is simply distribution through embedded delivery.</p>
<p>There are four core tenets to fully operate as a financial services provider: a customer-facing product, transactional infrastructure, risk management and compliance, and customer servicing. In the case of lending, there is a fifth tenet: Companies also need to be able to manage capital. Embedded financial services help companies sidestep the majority of what it really means to be a fintech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>White-labeling versus “becoming a fintech”</h2>
<p>While embedded finance is hot today, white-labeled financial services have been around for decades. Branded credit cards, for example, are a common paradigm for white-labeling. They quickly became a lasting way to incentivize consumer loyalty but don’t signal real effort or know-how in financial services. United and Alaska don’t run credit checks, configure billing or handle disputes for cardholding customers, nor do they assume any risk by embossing their logo on a card. The partnerships are<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/07/15/how-airlines-make-billions-from-monetizing-frequent-flyer-programs/?sh=62a452b914e9"> major money makers</a> for airlines while the risk stays on the financial institutions’ side (Chase, Bank of America and Visa). This risk can even account for significant loss on the financial side: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/your-money/airline-frequent-flier-credit-card.html">According</a> to American Express, 21% of its outstanding credit card loans belonged to people with a Delta credit card a few years ago.</p>
<p>This white-labeling approach is becoming common for other services, coming to life in forms like<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-money"> banking offerings from cell carriers</a>, and it’s by design: Financial services are complex and highly regulated, so brands prefer to defer most of the work to the experts. So while United, Delta or T-Mobile offer financial services under their brand, they are definitely not becoming fintech companies.</p>
<p>In contrast, some corporations are seeing the opportunity to build financial services from the ground up. Walmart’s move to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-28/goldman-s-consumer-chief-ismail-makes-surprise-exit-for-fintech"> snag</a> Goldman Sachs talent to lead its foray into finance (with Ribbit at the helm) shows promise for a true fintech spinout.</p>
<p>The investment in expertise in compliance and risk management furthers the company’s potential to build detailed and relevant infrastructure from the get-go — a significant step beyond the retailer’s many existing white-labeled financial partnerships.</p>
<h2>The limitations of platforms as a service</h2>
<p>Tools and turnkey solutions that help non-finance companies build financial applications more recently came into the mix: VCs are enthusiastic about new players building embedded payments, lending and, more recently, banking platform services (also known as BaaS) through APIs and backend tools.</p>
<p>As opposed to financial infrastructure services provided directly by sponsor banks or processors providing payments or ledger services, these platforms abstract the underlying infrastructure, wrap them with friendly-to-use APIs, and bundle core financial elements like risk management, compliance and servicing. While these platforms do offer some self-efficacy for companies to provide financial services, their major limitation is that they’re general purpose by design.</p>
<p>Fintechs found an opportunity to serve customers overlooked and underserved by traditional finance through specialization. Traditional financial institutions long applied the generalist model, carrying hundreds of SKUs and serving all segments. This strategy inevitably led banks to invest more in services for their most profitable customers, optimizing for their needs. Less profitable segments were left with stale and one-size-fits-all offerings.</p>
<p>Fintechs’ success with these underserved segments is derived from a relentless pursuit and laser focus on addressing core customers&#8217; unique needs, building products and services designed for them. In order to deliver on this promise, fintechs must innovate across all layers of the stack &#8212; from the product experience and feature set to the infrastructure and risk management, all the way down to servicing.</p>
<p>UI is not nearly enough to differentiate, and addressing customers’ needs while minding overall unit economics is critical. One fintech’s choices on these matters may be completely different from another if they address different segments &#8212; it all boils down to tradeoffs. For example, deciding on which data sources to use and balancing between onboarding and transactional risk look different if optimizing for freelancers rather than larger small businesses.</p>
<p>In contrast, third-party platform providers must be generic enough to power a broad range of companies and to enable multiple use cases. While the companies partnering with these services can build and customize at the product feature level, they are heavily reliant on their platform partner for infrastructure and core financial services, thus limited to that partner’s configurations and capabilities.</p>
<p>As such, embedded platform services work well to power straightforward commoditized tasks like credit card processing, but limit companies’ ability to differentiate on more complex offerings, like banking, which require end-to-end optimization.</p>
<p>More generally and from a customer’s perspective, embedded fintech partnerships are most effective when providing confined financial services within specific user flows to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
<p>For example, a company can offer credit at the point of sale through a third-party provider to enable a purchase. However, when considering general purpose and standalone financial services, the benefits of embedded fintech are much weaker.</p>
<h2>Building a product of choice</h2>
<p>The biggest proponents of embedded finance argue that large companies and brands can be successful with finance add-ons on their platforms because of their brand recognition and install base.</p>
<p>But that overlooks the reality of choice in the market: Just because a customer does one facet of their business with a company doesn’t necessarily mean they want that company as their provider for everything, especially if the service is inferior to what they can get elsewhere.</p>
<p>While the fintech market booms and legacy brands continue to buy into the opportunity, verticalized, full-stack fintechs will trump their generic offerings time and time again. Some aspects of embedded finance and white-labeling will continue to crop up or prevail, like payment processing and buy now, pay later services. But customers will continue to choose the banks/neobanks, lenders and tools built for them and their own unique needs, bucking the &#8220;every company is a fintech&#8221; fallacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever sold a house, you know what a pain it is to go through the process of listing, showing and negotiating the sale of your home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so much of a pain that many people put it off as long as possible because they don’t want to deal with it. The result is fewer homes on the market, which exacerbates existing housing shortages in already tight markets such as the San Francisco Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to help address the problem, one startup called Aalto has built out a new kind of homeowner marketplace. It’s a private one that doesn’t rely on the MLS, and gives sellers more control of how and when their homes are listed, shown and sold. Today </span><a href="https://aalto.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is emerging from stealth and announcing that it has raised $13 million in a Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.background.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://defy.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defy Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.maplevc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maple VC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Greg Waldorf &#8212; the first investor at Trulia &#8212; also participated in the financing, which brings Aalto’s total raised to $17.3 million since its 2018 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto’s online marketplace, which launched in April of this year, directly connects homeowners to buyers. The company claims that a potential seller can list their home on its platform in five minutes, rather than a typical process that is closer to five weeks. Since launching in the Bay Area, Aalto has built up a network of more than 30,000 buyers and more than two dozen homes have been sold via the marketplace. Currently, about 85 homes are listed for sale on its platform, with an average of one new home being added per day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, Aalto founder and CEO Nick Narodny is the son and brother of real estate agents. He concedes that the startup’s platform could be seen as a threat to the industry, but notes the trade-off is that more homes end up on the market, which helps minimize the region’s affordability crisis, and sellers see higher returns.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, 5-10% of total available inventory listed in competitive markets like Dublin, Fremont, Mill Valley and Milpitas are listed on the Aalto platform. And, Narodny said, the company is on its way to bring more homes to market, sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buying or selling a home is one of the biggest events people will ever experience, but it’s also a tedious, outdated process,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto aims to double the number of homes on the market in the Bay Area by streamlining the way homeowners can list, without the third-parties or contracts required elsewhere. This dramatically lowers the bar to sell, according to Narodny, bringing homes to market an average of four and a half months earlier than traditional real estate processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a preview listing feature that allows sellers to list with no commitment. They can also build a waitlist of qualified buyers for their home while they consider a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We pull the tax record and info to make it super easy and ask the seller to fill out a Q&amp;A,” Narodny said. After filling out that info, sellers can then see interested buyers and those that are prequalified or that can make all cash offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is also less intrusive, Narodny said, by giving the seller more of a say in who sees their home and when. For example, sellers can also line up virtual or in-person showings on their own schedule. And they can sell the homes on their timelines &#8212; whether it be in a few weeks, or few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a San Francisco-based hand surgeon recently listed his home on the Aalto platform with the desire of moving at the end of October. More than two dozen people were interested and he allowed a few people to tour the home. He was able to sell the house based on a timeline that was more beneficial for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can sell totally on their terms and are much more connected in the process,” Narodny said. Busy professionals such as the surgeon and individuals with director and above titles as well as growing families so far are among the most common sellers on the platform.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189025" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189025" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189025 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aalto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there is an economic benefit. By removing a middleman, or agent, from the process, sellers can make an average of $44,000 more on their home sale, according to Narodny. The startup charges a 1% fee, compared to the 2-2.5% commission that an agent charges. But if a seller requires help “with the hard stuff,” Aalto has “expert, licensed” people available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to personalize the listing appeals to some. Sellers can craft descriptions of their homes in a way that comes across as more personal than if an agent does it, according to Narodny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have them tell their own story of their home,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approach also gives them more privacy. For example, an MLS will show when a home was listed and any price reductions. A home listed on Aalto won’t include any of that information. Also similar to Airbnb, the seller’s exact address is not shared, just a radius. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit for buyers &#8212; besides having more options &#8212; is the ability</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to set up instant alerts, join waitlists and schedule showings in one easy-to-use platform. They can also “anonymously prequalify and share that with a seller,” Narodny said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Schreier, partner at Sequoia Capital, believes that real estate is “one of the last giant industries with a 1900s experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a painful process where the seller has limited visibility and the buyer is holding their breath after every bid,” he said. “Aalto is the first company to reinvent how homes are bought and sold by putting the consumer first. It goes far beyond a listing site and reinvents every aspect of the experience to be customer oriented rather than realtor oriented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to expand beyond the Bay Area to other major metropolitan real estate markets in California and across the country. It also plans to use its new capital to continue improving its technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Narodny insists that while the platform may be seen as a threat by some agents, it’s not a malicious thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My family and I are very close. It’s something that I talk about with them quite a bit,” he told TechCrunch. “I believe Aalto truly is additive. We still work with them every day and will continue to&#8230;It’s not like agents are totally being replaced.”</span></p>

The company told investors during an earnings call that it plans to build EV factories in the US and Thailand in 2022 and start mass producing vehicles the following year. Chairman Liu Young-way said the company is also in talks regarding possible locations for plants in Europe.</p>
<p>At its US facility, Foxconn will build vehicles for EV clients including Fisker. The companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fisker-foxconn-035645198.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>signed a deal in May</ins></a>, and Foxconn plans to start making Fisker EVs by the end of 2023. The two are jointly investing in the Project Pear vehicle and will share revenue from it.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Foxconn is in discussions with three states, including Wisconsin, for the EV plant, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Taiwan-s-Foxconn-to-build-EV-plants-in-US-and-Thailand-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nikkei" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a>.

<p>The planned Thai factory will form part of Foxconn&#8217;s joint venture with oil and gas conglomerate PTT. The two are working on a platform for EV and component production. Liu said Foxconn plans to build up to 200,000 EVs at that plant each year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is thrilled to announce Seth Rogen is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt this September</a>. The movie-star-turned-pot-businessman is speaking on his latest venture: Houseplant, his privately funded entrée into the cannabis business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldberg-want-to-be-your-weed-dealer/">Houseplant made a big splash when it launched in 2021</a>, and it continues to get a lot of attention in the noisy world of cannabis. But, of course, having Seth Rogen involved helps keep the company relevant.</p>
<p>You know Seth. Seth Rogen is one of the biggest stars in the entertainment world and isn&#8217;t shy about his use of cannabis — the plant is nearly a co-star in each of his movies. And now he&#8217;s selling different strains and lifestyle house goods, too.</p>
<p>Houseplant quickly gained a large following. As a result, we have a lot of questions. First, we want to know about Houseplant&#8217;s trajectory and its involvement with the cannabis giant, Canopy Growth. And then there&#8217;s Houseplant&#8217;s use of social media, which is instrumental in the company&#8217;s success. How can other cannabis companies learn from Houseplant&#8217;s strategies? And then there&#8217;s the celebrity angle, too. How can a brand net a high-profile spokesperson or investor, and at what cost?</p>
<p>Houseplant isn&#8217;t just a variety project for co-founders Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. This company can become a significant player in the cannabis world, and we&#8217;re thrilled to have Seth on our stage, answering questions and giving advice.</p>
<p>Passes are now available for the virtual show and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">there&#8217;s a handful of pass options with discounts for founders, students and non-profits</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Get your ticket soon</a> though, prices more than double on September 20. We hope to see you online.</p>
