										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the autonomous driving race in China heats up, Didi is rushing to expand its car fleets by picking Swedish automaker Volvo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/uber-orders-24000-volvo-xc90s-for-driverless-fleet/">an old partner of Uber</a>, as its ally.</p>
<p>Didi said on Monday it will be using the XC90 SUVs of Volvo, which has been owned by Chinese auto company Geely since 2010, for its global network of robotaxis in the long term. Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">created a subsidiary</a> dedicated to autonomous driving last year and the unit has since <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-autonomous-driving/company_financials">raised about $800 million</a> from investors including SoftBank Vision Fund and IDG Capital. The subsidiary now has over 500 employees.</p>
<p>Didi started out as a ride-share app in 2012 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">gobbled up Uber China in 2016</a>. It now offers a range of mobility services including taxi hailing, ride-hailing, carpooling, shared bikes and scooters, as well as financial services for drivers. The company is seeking a valuation north of $100 billion in an initial public offering, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-didi-ipo-banks-exclusive-idUSKBN2BW0TG">Reuters reported last month</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Didi&#8217;s autonomous driving arm has been testing robotaxis for the past two years in China and the United States, but Volvo&#8217;s XC90 model will be the first to adopt Didi&#8217;s freshly minted self-driving hardware system called Gemini, which contains sensors like short, mid and long-range lidars, radars, cameras, a thermal imager; a fallback system; and remote assistance through 5G networks.</p>
<p>Didi said that its Gemini platform, coupled with Volvo&#8217;s backup functions including steering, braking and electric power, will eventually allow its robotaxis to remove safety drivers. If any of the primary systems fail during a ride, Volvo&#8217;s backup systems can act to bring the vehicle to a safe stop.</p>
<p>Didi is competing against a clutch of well-funded robotaxi startups in China, such as Pony.ai and WeRide, which are busy testing in major Chinese cities and California while splurging on R&amp;D expenses to reach Level 4 driving. AutoX, another Chinese robotaxi company, announced last week that it will be using Honda&#8217;s Accord and Inspire sedans for its test drives in China. The edge of Didi, some suggest, is the mountains of driving data accumulated from its ride-hailing business spanning Asia, Latin America, Africa and Russia.</p>
<p>Rising electric automakers like Nio and Xpeng have also joined in the race to automate vehicles, making bold claims that they, too, will be able to remove safety drivers soon. Meanwhile, traditional car manufacturers don&#8217;t want to fall behind. BAIC, a state-owned enterprise, for instance, is adding Huawei&#8217;s advanced automation system and smart cockpit to its new electric passenger cars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a year after the pandemic began, remote work shows no signs of going away. While it has its cons, it remains </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">top of mind for potential employees around the world before joining a new company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while most people in Africa still go to physical offices despite the pandemic, a few companies have nevertheless embraced this concept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a New York-based startup that helps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/andela-a-tech-training-and-development-outsourcer-for-african-coders-raises-40m/">tech companies build remote engineering teams from Africa</a>, was one of the first to publicly announce it was going remote on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is doubling down on this effort by announcing the global expansion of its engineering talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the past six months, the company has seen a 750% increase in applicants outside Africa. More than 30% of Andela&#8217;s inbound engineer applications also came from outside the continent in March alone. Half this number came from Latin America while Africa saw a 500% increase in applications as well.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Andela, which builds engineering teams tapping African talent, goes fully remote and opens to the wider continent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/embed/#?secret=xWWMJQ9rcy" data-secret="xWWMJQ9rcy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Andela launched in 2014, it built hubs in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to source, vet and train engineers to be part of remote teams for international companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also tested satellite models in Egypt and Ghana as substitutes to physical hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company would issue a call </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for applications, select a few (less than 1%), pay them a salary for the first six months and provide them with housing and food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also helped developers improve their skills via training and mentorship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100,000 engineers have taken part in the company&#8217;s learning network and community, and,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of 2019, Andela had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/what-is-andela-the-africa-tech-talent-accelerator/">more than 1,500 engineers</a> on its payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after noticing that this model wasn&#8217;t sustainable, it began to make changes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it let go of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 420 junior engineers across Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months later, citing the pandemic, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/">laid off 135 employees</a> while introducing salary cuts for senior staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite the layoffs, the pandemic provided some form of clarity to how Andela wanted to operate &#8212; which was remote, judging by the success of the satellite models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the very beginning, a developer had to be in Lagos to work with Andela. Then it became living in Nigeria. Then Kenya. Then Uganda, Rwanda,&#8221; CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Before the pandemic, Andela was opening applications in country after country. The pandemic came and changed that as we opened up to the entire continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shutting down its existing physical campuses and going remote also helped the company focus on getting engineers with more experience to meet its clients&#8217; requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experiment, which the company conducted in less than a year, is also part of its mission to be a global company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That went so well and we thought &#8216;what if we accelerated it now that we&#8217;re remote and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable applicants from anywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8217; because it was always the plan to become a global company. That was clear, but the timing was the question. We did that and it&#8217;s been an amazing experiment,&#8221; Johnson added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with its global expansion, its clients can tap into regional expertise to support international growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a statement released by the firm, it currently has engineers from 37 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson didn&#8217;t go into details about how many of these engineers are getting jobs from Andela or even its total developer count</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s more interested in helping its clients solve the diversity issues that have plagued many Western corporations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela is currently working with eight companies that have hired its engineers in Latin America and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the diversity play, the CEO says that means Andela engineers get to prove themselves on a global playing field in a way the company has &#8220;always wanted to see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela serves more than 200 customers, including GitHub, ViacomCBS, Pluralsight, Seismic, Cloudflare, Coursera and InVision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. GitHub is one company that seems to be benefitting from Andela&#8217;s new offerings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s VP of Engineering, Dana Lawson, in a statement said, “As a business in the developer tool space, a lot of us are trying to enter those areas of the world (Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa) where the emergent developers are coming so we can better understand their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a local presence there with amazing talent is super valuable to building a global product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its quest to become a global company, going up against competition is unavoidable for the seven-year-old company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since most of these companies are horizontal marketplaces (providing a wide range of expertise), whereas Andela is vertical, Johson believes there&#8217;s enough market share to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be acquired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are focused on building digital products, and because of that, we&#8217;re able to do more, essentially, for our customers&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where our focus is &#8212; [building long-term relationships] and around building great digital products,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded by Jeremy Johnson, Christina Sass, Nadayar Enegesi, Ian Carnevale, Brice Nkengsa and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. It has raised more than $180 million (up to Series D) from firms like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Generation Investment Management, Google Ventures and Spark Capital, at a valuation of about $700 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While announcing the layoffs last year, Andela said it was on an annual revenue run rate of $50 million. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen asked how this number has changed over the past year, Johnson said the company is &#8220;growing at a healthier pace as we&#8217;ve ever had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The future of remote work is global and Johnson believes Andela provides the vital link to talent wherever it is found. The company&#8217;s head of talent operations, Martin Chikilian, echoed similar sentiments regarding the expansion.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen exponential growth and interest from engineers from across Africa who want to work with some of the world&#8217;s most exciting technology-focused companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Growing our network of talent from Africa to include more markets is a unique proposition and we continue to match talent with opportunity beyond geographical boundaries.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.payzilch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zilch</a>, a London startup that has built an &#8220;over the top&#8221; buy now, pay later (BNPL) business out of cutting deals directly with consumers &#8212; bypassing the need for integrating anything new into an e-commerce site&#8217;s check-out process, as many of the leading providers have done &#8212; has raised $80 million, an all-equity Series B that values the company at over $500 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Gauss Ventures and M&amp;F Fund, among other unnamed investors. The startup has up to now opted to raise from individuals and smaller firms, CEO and founder Philip Belamant said in an interview, although that may change in future rounds as it looks both to bring in a tier-one debt line, not just to fuel growth in its current market of the UK but to expand to more countries, including the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For now, Zilch has financed usage of its service off its own balance sheet: it has more than 500,000 users, Belamant said, and is seeing sign-ups of around 4,000 a day on its app.</p>
<p>BNPL is a payment scheme that has been around as long as stores themselves, but its emergence online has been more a later arrival. It&#8217;s proven to be a very popular one. A recent report from <a href="https://worldpay.globalpaymentsreport.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldpay</a> estimated that in the UK, which is the world&#8217;s third-biggest e-commerce market in its estimation (£192 billion, or $266 billion, transacted in 2020), BNPL will account for 10% of all sales by 2024, when the overall e-commerce market will be worth £264 billion ($366 billion).</p>
<p>Most schemes today are run by third parties &#8212; Klarna and Affirm being two of the biggest &#8212; who ink deals with e-commerce companies and integrate in the check-out alongside other options for payment. Zilch&#8217;s key differentiation has been that it&#8217;s cut a deal with only one other company &#8212; Mastercard &#8212; and created a payment card with it so that when a person wants to pay using Zilch, they use the Mastercard number in the checkout, which then triggers the option to them to either pay in installments or pay as you would with a normal credit card.</p>
<p>As with other BNPL schemes, Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge fees on its service, and instead makes a cut in the transaction from the retailer (part of the fee retailers pay to card companies in card transactions: the deals are all predicated on the idea that these alternatives to paying everything up front increases conversions, and that &#8216;convenience&#8217; is what retailers are paying to have as an option). Its approach is pretty straightforward: it offers installments for paying back that start with 25% up front (so not exactly &#8220;zilch&#8221;) and paying for the item in full in 25% installments over 6 weeks. For those who miss a payment, they are stopped from using the service again until this gets cleared but Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge late fees.</p>
<p>The prospect of bypassing the retailer means that Zilch has been able to scale by making its service more applicable to more payment scenarios, a model that Belamant said was inspired by another killer disaggregator.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;If you look at when Amazon started, many commented on it being a phenomenal bookstore, but they built an infrastructure to sell everything. They could have built that covering different booksellers one by one but Amazon went direct to the consumer and said it would ship any book in a day. How profitable is not your problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn’t want to be beholden to the retailer and wanted the relationship with consumer. We go to them and say, pay over time, and use us anywhere you like. We built this technology plugging them in on one side and plugging retailers on the other. We can now build up any way to play and can use it anywhere they like without being restricted by retailers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Conversely, this has also helped Zilch fend off competition from bigger BNPL players, at least up to now: &#8220;Their main customers are retailers, and they have pre-existing arrangements with those retailers,&#8221; Belamant said of the Affirms and Klarnas of the world. Offering a model similar to Zilch&#8217;s, he said, &#8220;would have to circumvent those services, and that’s a massive cannibalization. Can they do that? Well, it&#8217;s naive to say they can’t. But will they? I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zilch&#8217;s approach of riding the rails of Mastercard &#8212; which may well soon to be augmented by other providers like Visa &#8212; means that it can quickly distribute a recognized payment method, but as Belamant describes it, it&#8217;s Zilch that is still building the algorithms to make the credit evaluations for individual consumers.</p>
<p>Using what Belamant described to me as &#8220;soft credit checks&#8221; alongside <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking</a> data &#8212; a system used in the UK and Europe that taps into using APIs to share and integrate data from one financial service with another (in this case a way to easily check a person&#8217;s credit and financial history by way of their bank details as they are applying for a new financial service) &#8212; people sign up and automatically get assessed for their suitability for a BNPL scheme.</p>
<p>This has helped the company, as it says, become the first BNPL provider to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial services regulator in the UK that has run an investigation of BNPL companies and appears to be preparing tighter regulation around how they can work, to stave off people inadvertently walking into spending money that they don&#8217;t have and may never be able to repay. Zilch was officially authorized as a consumer credit provider in 2020.</p>
<p>This is not to say that others in the space will not be able to also get the same certification for their models, incidentally, but it might mean more regulatory hoops, possibly slower growth, and perhaps also more consumer wariness as the situation continues to get more publicity. (The UK in particular has a pretty sordid history with other schemes to provide people with financing, specifically around the murky practices associated with payday loan schemes, and that has left a bad taste in many consumers&#8217; mouths.)</p>
<p>One specific advantage also of linking up with a card company is that, in this world of &#8220;everything will soon be virtual&#8221;, it gives Zilch users access to a card, which they can in turn use to also shop using BNPL in brick-and-mortar stores. Tap and Pay-over-time, as it&#8217;s called, means users can integrate the card number into a digital wallet to and use it as they would their handsets to pay with Apple or Android-based payment schemes. Zilch said it&#8217;s the first BNPL do make this leap. (To be clear, for now there is no physical &#8216;card&#8217; although it seems they are considering how and if to offer it.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gett.com/intl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gett</a>, the ride-hailing startup that has been carving out a niche for itself in a crowded and competitive market for on-demand transportation by focusing on enterprise accounts and connecting people with rides in some 1,500 cities leveraging a number of third-party fleets, is adding another partner today as it continues to double down on its business model in the wake of corporate travel slowly coming back online.</p>
<p>Gett has inked a deal to integrate <a href="https://gocurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curb Mobility</a> to integrate yellow taxis into Gett&#8217;s app, which will now cover some 65 cities across the US. The news is coming at a time when Gett is looking to expand its service to meet more demand: it notes that rides currently at around 80% of the levels they were in Q1 2020, just ahead of Covid-19 really descending on the western world.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the deal does not involve any investment between Gett &#8212; which has raised around $865 million to date (including most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gett-raises-115m-more-for-its-on-demand-ride-hailing-platform-for-business-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing a $115 million round</a>) and was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2019 &#8212; and Curb &#8212; which is a part of Verifone, after the payments hardware company <a href="https://paymentweek.com/2015-10-13-verifone-acquires-curb-expands-e-hail-payments-and-media-business-8545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired it in 2015</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(If you think it sounds odd for a payments hardware company to own a taxi fleet app, this is only part of Curb&#8217;s business and is in fact also a hardware player: in addition to Curb providing a way to hail yellow taxis &#8212; it app covers some 50,000 cabs and 100,000 drivers &#8212; the company also builds hardware for cabs and fleet operations, including metering apps, payment terminals, and those interactive screens for passengers that let them pay for rides, watch news and advertisements and more.)</p>
<p>To differentiate its service from the very highly capitalized Ubers and Lyfts of the world, Gett has been building out a two-pronged strategy that covers both how it scales, and the services that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>On the scaling front, Gett has been moving away from managing fleets of contractor drivers in the US for some years now: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/juno-shuts-down-its-operations-in-nyc-as-owner-gett-signs-strategic-partnership-with-lyft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>, after slogging it out for years against Lyft and Uber in its primary New York metro market, Gett effectively shut down its main fleet operation in the region and instead inked a deal with Lyft. That has become a template of sorts that the company has been repeating in other cities outside of the U.S. where it doesn&#8217;t have substantial market share. (For example, Ola is another Gett partner.) In some cities where it has a larger footprint, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">like London and Tel Aviv, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gett works with drivers directly.</span></p>
<p>Partner fleets made up one-third of Gett&#8217;s business in the first quarter of this year, but as Gett brings on more to its network, it expects partner fleets to cover the majority of its rides by the end of this year, the company said.</p>
<p>On the service front, Gett has made a big bet on building a platform that integrates with businesses at the back end to make it easier to order rides and for them to reconcile more easily with a businesses expense management and accounting software. Gett&#8217;s big pitch to would-be customers is that this software makes it less expensive and significantly more efficient to hail a cab using Gett compared to the alternatives &#8212; for starters users can compare different prices from different providers &#8212; and it gives users significantly more choice.</p>
<p>“Today’s partnership cements Gett’s position as a technology platform focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM), where spend is worth $79.6 billion globally,&#8221; said Dave Waiser, CEO and co-founder of Gett, in a statement. &#8220;In recent years, we have become the GTM category leader, serving over a quarter of Fortune 500 companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the part of Curb, it gives drivers using its software another link through to an app that might bring in more business at a time when riders have more choice than ever before, covering not just other on-demand car apps, but eco-friendly, exercise-ready, and traffic-busting options like e-bikes, scooters and shared rides. As the profile of the average corporate user changes and gets younger, that too will change the expectations many of them will have for what constitutes a preferred set of ground transportation options, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>“As cities across the U.S. prepare for the return of international travel, our partnership with Gett will create new income opportunities for local drivers and ensure Gett&#8217;s business users have access to the same safe, reliable transportation options trusted by locals,&#8221; said Amos Tamam, CEO at Curb. &#8220;By integrating with platforms like Gett, we&#8217;re aiming to make taxis more ubiquitous online by opening up new digital avenues for today’s consumers and businesses to find and book taxis.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Gett has shifted Moscow out of direct fleet management and currently operates this model in London and Tel Aviv.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six-year-old Bangalore-based fintech Razorpay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">topped a $1 billion valuation late last year</a>, becoming the first Y Combinator-backed Indian startup to reach the much sought after unicorn status. In less than six months since, the Indian startup has tripled its valuation and is preparing to launch in the Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Razorpay said on Monday it has raised $160 million in its Series E financing round that valued the startup at $3 billion, up from “a little over” $1 billion valuation in the $100 million Series D in October last year.</p>
<p>The new round has been co-led by existing investors Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund &#8212; GIC &#8212; and Sequoia Capital India. Some other existing investors including Ribbit Capital also participated in the new round, which takes Razorpay&#8217;s to-date raise to $366.5 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes and disburses money online for small businesses and enterprises &#8212; essentially everything Stripe does in the U.S. and several other developed markets. But the Indian startup’s offering goes much further than that: In recent years, Razorpay has launched a neobanking platform to issue corporate credit cards (more at the bottom of the article), and it also offers businesses working capital.</p>
<p>With the global giant Stripe still nowhere in the Indian picture, Razorpay has grown to become the market leader. And now, the startup plans to replicate its success from the home country in Southeast Asian markets, Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“We are one of the largest payments providers in the Indian ecosystem. We want to take the learnings we have in India to the Southeast Asian market. Before the end of the financial year, we want to launch in one or two Southeast Asian markets,” said Mathur, adding that the new round gives it the valuation to more confidently explore some M&amp;A opportunities to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>More than 5 million businesses in India rely on Razorpay’s technology to process payments. Some of these clients include Facebook, telecom operator Airtel, ride-hailing firm Ola, food-delivery startup Swiggy, and fintech CRED.</p>
<p>Mathur and Shashank Kumar &#8212; pictured above &#8212; met at IIT Roorkee college. The duo realized early on that small businesses faced immense difficulties in accepting money digitally and the existing payments processing firms weren’t designed to tackle the needs of small businesses and startups.</p>
<p>Solving this issue became Razorypay’s goal, and in the early days about 11 individuals shared a single apartment as the co-founders scrambled to convince bankers to work with them. The conversations were slow and remained in a deadlock for so long that the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenge to investors numerous times, they recalled in an interview two years ago.</p>
<p>The stories one hears about Razorpay today have changed dramatically. In a Clubhouse room, known for sharp criticism of products, dozens of developers and startup founders recently recalled their early interactions with Razorpay, and how the startup&#8217;s officials helped their businesses start with &#8212; or move to &#8212; the Razorpay&#8217;s system within hours after reaching out.</p>
<p>Deepak Abbot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/former-paytm-execs-team-up-indiagold/">co-founder of Indiagold</a>, recently recalled an incident where his startup had missed an alert, and that coupled with a snafu at the bank, resulted in the startup running out of funds to pay customers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I expected Harshil to pause and think but he said let us add 10 lakhs just to be on a safer side. And while we were chatting <a href="https://twitter.com/shashankmehta05?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shashankmehta05</a> sent me a whatsapp that money has been added to our account 4/5</p>
<p>&mdash; Deepak Abbot (@deepakabbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1358799358498492416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Last year, Mathur said Razorpay’s core business &#8212; processing payments &#8212; was fast-growing and the startup would focus more on building the two new offerings.</p>
<p>Offering an update, Mathur said Razorpay X now serves about 15,000 businesses, up from fewer than 5,000 in October last year. Razorpay Capital is now annually bandying out about $80 million to clients, up from less than $40 million a year ago. The duration of the loan Razorpay provides ranges from three to six months, and the ticket size is typically between 0.8 million to 1 million Indian rupees ($10,730 to $13,400).</p>
<p>Mathur said the startup will focus on further growing this business in the next three years and then look at taking the startup public. &#8220;If it was just the payments processing business, we could go public right now. But our ambitions are beyond &#8212; to become the full ecosystem for businesses. And on those new sides (neobanking and lending), we are early,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup’s marquee offering has grown 40-50% month-on-month in the past six months. It now plans to process over $50 billion in total payment volume by the end of 2021. The startup also plans to hire a number of people. It currently has over 600 open positions, several in Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when a slice of Indian startups are raising large amounts of capital at a much frequent pace and increased valuations as investors double down on promising bets in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Indian startups social commerce Meesho, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED</a>, e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy, millennials-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">social network ShareChat</a> attained the unicorn status earlier this month. TechCrunch reported last week that SoftBank is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/banking-tech-zeta-fundraise-sb/">invest in Zeta</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">Swiggy</a>.</p>
<p>*Razorpay offers a number of value-added services such as automating vendor payments, real-time reconciliation and analytics, managing subscriptions, GST invoicing, designing and creating websites. The startup has also developed an app-based substitute for payments terminals (also known as POS) as well as pay-by-link for enabling offline commerce. Its offering is also part of Amazon&#8217;s new Digital Suite focused at SMBs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you accept that VMware is in play, the prospective price tag means that the number of firms that could afford such a purchase are few and far between.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch has spilled much digital ink tracking the fate of VMware since it was brought to Dell’s orbit thanks to the latter company’s epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">purchase of EMC in 2016</a> for $58 billion. That transaction saddled the well-known Texas tech company with heavy debts. Because the deal left VMware a public company, albeit one controlled by Dell, how it might be used to pay down some of its parent company’s arrears was a constant question.</p>
<p>Dell made its move earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">agreeing to spin out VMware</a> in exchange for a huge one-time dividend, a five-year commercial partnership agreement, lots of stock for existing Dell shareholders and Michael Dell retaining his role as chairman of its board.</p>
<p>So, where does the deal leave VMware in terms of independence, and in terms of Dell influence? Dell no longer will hold formal control over VMware as part of the deal, though its shareholders will retain a large stake in the virtualization giant. And with Michael Dell staying on VMware’s board, it will retain influence.</p>
<p>Here’s how VMware described it to shareholders <a href="https://ir.vmware.com/download/companies/vmware/Presentations/VMware%20Spin-off%20Slide%20Deck.pdf">in a presentation</a> this week. The graphic shows that under the new agreement, VMware is no longer a subsidiary of Dell and will now be an independent company.</p>

<p>But with VMware tipped to become independent once again, it could become something of a takeover target. When Dell controlled VMware thanks to majority ownership, a hostile takeover felt out of the question. Now, VMware is a more possible target to the right company with the right offer &#8212; provided that the Dell spinout works as planned.</p>
<p>Buying VMware would be an expensive effort, however. It&#8217;s worth around $67 billion today. Presuming a large premium would be needed to take this particular technology chess piece off the competitive board, it could cost $100 billion or more to snag VMware from the public markets.</p>
<p>So VMware will soon be more free to pursue a transaction that might be favorable to its shareholders &#8212; which will still include every Dell shareholder, because they are receiving stock in VMware as part of its spinout &#8212; without worrying about its parent company simply saying no.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a month ago, Peloton CEO John Foley <a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-">wrote an open letter</a> about the the company&#8217;s treadmill. “I’m reaching out to you today because I recently learned about a tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death,” it begins. “While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”</p>
<p>Today, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning, telling users to stop using the Tread+. Citing 39 incidents, included the aforementioned death, the CPSC writes, “The Commission has found that the public health and safety requires this notice to warn the public quickly of the hazard.”</p>
<p>Peloton followed up with its own strongly worded statement writing, “The company is troubled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission&#8217;s (CPSC) unilateral press release about the Peloton Tread+ because it is inaccurate and misleading. There is no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.”</p>
<p>The commission’s warning includes multiple injuries involving small children and a pet. Specifically, the note calls for users with children at how to cease using the product, a more stern warning than the initial suggestions outlined by Foley back in in March, who at the time told users to keep children and pets away from the system and store the device out of reach after using. Peloton has since added that there have been 23 incidents involving children, 15 with objects and, as the CPSC noted, one with a pet. The company added that it had not revealed the specifics previously out of privacy concern.</p>
<p>“If consumers must continue to use the product, CPSC urges consumers to use the product only in a locked room, to prevent access to children and pets while the treadmill is in use,” the organization notes. “Keep all objects, including exercise balls and other equipment, away from the treadmill.”</p>
<p>For its part, the connected fitness maker adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peloton invited CPSC to make a joint announcement about the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided with the Tread+, and Foley asked to meet directly with CPSC. CPSC has unfairly characterized Peloton&#8217;s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC&#8217;s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth. The company already urged Members to follow all warnings and safety instructions. Peloton is disappointed that, despite its offers of collaboration, and despite the fact that the Tread+ complies with all applicable safety standards, CPSC was unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. If you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning, sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>This week, Scale AI raised a $325 million Series E. The company, as TechCrunch has written, works in the data labeling space. And it has been on a fundraising tear over the last few years. In 2019 TechCrunch wrote about how the company’s then-22-year-old CEO had put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/">together a $100 million round</a>. Then in December of 2020, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">raised $155 million at a roughly $3.5 billion valuation</a>. Now it’s worth more than $7 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Impressive, yeah? Well, as I learned earlier this week, AI startups in general are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">having one hell of a year</a>. From the start of 2021 to April 12th, there were 442 AI-startup deals in the U.S. worth $11.65 billion, according to PitchBook data. And the recent Microsoft-Nuance AI deal may accelerate things even more.</p>
<p>Sapphire Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das?lang=en">Jai Das</a> weighed in on the AI venture market for The Exchange. He answered our question regarding how competitive the space was in the first quarter by saying that “investment activity in AI/ML startups has been absolutely insane” during the first quarter.</p>
<p>Per Das: “AI/ML startups are routinely getting 5-6 term sheets from top-tier VC firms and they are able to raise their financings at 150-250X of current ARR.”</p>
<p>Chew on that for a moment. We’ve seen public software multiples reach new heights in the last year, but even for aggressive startup rounds, those are some bonkers numbers. Imagine an AI-focused startup with $1 million in recurring revenue being valued at a quarter of a billion dollars. <em>Damn</em>.</p>
<p>But what about pace among AI investing? We’ve heard that the time from a round opening to its closing among many startups has been compressed and compressed again. Das helped explain the situation, saying in an email that “most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens,” which means that there is “no need to do any due diligence during the financing.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZnnC0mcCQ9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">Expect an even hotter AI venture capital market in the wake of the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Expect an even hotter AI venture capital market in the wake of the Microsoft-Nuance deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/embed/#?secret=ZnnC0mcCQ9" data-secret="ZnnC0mcCQ9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That actually makes some sense? If rounds are largely preemptive &#8212; something that Das underscored later on in his comments &#8212; you <em>have</em> to do pre-diligence. Otherwise you’ll always be investing blind or missing out on deals due to other firms moving more quickly.</p>
<p>This week The Exchange also dug into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">broader domestic venture capital market</a>, with a special focus on seed deals, and the super late-stage investments that dominate headlines. A comment on the earlier-stages of venture investing that just missed our piece on the matter came from <a href="https://twitter.com/grabow?lang=en">Jeff Grabow</a>, EY’s U.S. Venture Capital lead.</p>
<p>In his comments on pre-seed, seed and post-seed deals, something stood out to us &#8212; a prediction of sorts. Here’s Grabow:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Q1 2021] was a strong quarter for pre-seed funding when you compare it to prior years, and we expect the overall environment to remain strong given the abundance of capital available and plethora of investable themes that tap into new markets via technological solutions. It paints a rosy picture for the post-COVID environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>That tracks with our internal estimates. Q1 2021 was so hot for at least American venture capital activity (expect more international coverage soon) that it seems likely that the year itself will be a record in many respects. Provided that things don’t slow too much, records will be broken. And here Grabow flat-out anticipates a pretty attractive climate for venture after COVID-19 is behind us.</p>
<p>So, records will be broken. The question is by how much.</p>
<h2>More notes on Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing</h2>
<p>Not to whomp the equestrian deceased too much, but I have a few more notes for you on the Coinbase direct listing.</p>
<p>Public.com, the Robinhood consumer trading rival, helped The Exchange better understand just how much retail interest there was in the stock. Per its ever-present spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/M0Osborne">Mo</a>, on April 14th, Coinbase “was the most popular stock on public,” measured by number of transactions. And perhaps more notably, on the same day “social activity (measured by the number of posts) increased by 70% compared to the day prior.”</p>
<p>I do not know how long the consumer trading boom can last, but that’s a pretty impressive set of metrics.</p>
<p>Similarweb also had a few data points to share, including that visits to coinbase.com reached 86.4 million in January. Hot damn. And during that month new visitors bested returning visitors. That data helps explain how Coinbase wound up with the epic first quarter that it did. Now the question is if it can keep up its bull run or, frankly, if consumer interest in trading in crypto specifically will outlast the equities trading boom or not.</p>
<p>Coinbase Series D lead investor <a href="https://twitter.com/tomloverro?lang=en">Tom Loverro</a>, who we’ve mentioned a few times this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">including on the podcast</a>, said that we’re still merely in the second inning of crypto. So expect these topics to keep coming up again and again. And again.</p>

<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Trying to actually stick to our word count target for once, here are some final notes on the IPO market from the week.</p>
<p>First, the AppLovin IPO did not go according to plan. After modestly pricing at $80 per share, the middle of its range, the mobile-app focused tech company saw its value fall during its first two days’ trading. It’s now worth $61 per share as of the end of Friday.</p>
<p>The Exchange spoke with AppLovin CFO <a href="https://twitter.com/heraldchen">Herald Chen</a> on its IPO day. Chatting with the finance executive, our read from the conversation is that the company could accelerate its acquisition game more now that it is public. Having a liquid stock means that it can be even more acquisitive than before. And AppLovin claims that it can buy companies, run them through its business process, and juice their revenues per its S-1 filing.</p>
<p>If that bears out, the public markets may be giving the company a bit too hard of a time. It was a bit odd to see a software company struggle post-IPO in today’s climate.</p>
<p>Chen also told The Exchange that his firm didn’t see any pushback regarding its multi-class share structure during its roadshow. The multi-class share miasm is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/snowflake-gave-up-its-dual-class-shares-should-you/">something I’ve written about</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">our own Ron Miller</a>. The CFO did note that no single person has complete control of the company, even with several different classes of equity with disparate voting rights. That matters, frankly.</p>
<p>We’ll keep tabs on AppLovin as it trades. (Our earlier coverage of its numbers is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/first-impressions-of-applovins-ipo-filing/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, autonomous trucking company TuSimple <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-self-driving-truck-rival-tusimple-raises-more-than-1-billion-in-ipo-valuing-it-at-8-5-billion-11618495532">went public this week</a>, and Similarweb <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415006093/en/Similarweb-Files-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering">filed to go public</a>. We’re also watching the broader IPO market as UiPath either raises its price range or note. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">have a guess on that score</a>.</p>
<p>And just as the week was closing, Squarespace dropped its S-1. Notes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/squarespace-files-for-a-direct-listing-on-the-nyse/">here</a> with more to come.</p>
<p>Good vibes and nothing other than the best from here,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Say it louder for the people in the back: As tech grows bigger by the minute and venture capital adds dollar signs by the day, a startup hub’s success is not an either/or situation. The next Silicon Valley is a tired narrative, when in reality startups look, innovate and create differently all over the world.</p>
<p>On that note, my colleagues spent the past few months digging into the market in Detroit, Michigan:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">The StockX EC-1 </a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">How StockX became the stock market of hype</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While StockX is the startup darling that may have put the region in the generalist spotlight, I soon learned that the sneaker marketplace company wasn’t at all where the city’s story started and ended. Instead, it started a little more at ground level.</p>
<p>Detroit techies consistently point to billionaire Dan Gilbert, the co-founder of Quicken Loans and the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the reason behind the region’s startup growth. It made me immediately wonder if all it takes to create a startup ecosystem is deep pockets.</p>
<p>Turns out it’s a little more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Gilbert has poured at least $2.5 billion into rehabilitating buildings in the core of Detroit. Then he invested in the companies that took office space in those buildings, the restaurants that would feed those new families in the area and the retailers that would fill up the side blocks. It wasn’t one check by one billionaire, but instead a measured and consistent approach to try to reestablish Detroit as a city of innovation within the United States.</p>

<p>I think one founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/hardware-is-still-hard-in-the-motor-city/">put it best</a>: “there are a lot of people who hate him, but the reality is that, while he wasn’t the only billionaire in town, he’s the only one who heavily invested in Detroit.”</p>
<p>Beyond Gilbert, the vitalization is spread throughout different sectors. There’s a 12-year-old early-stage venture firm that was one of the first to ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/a-quick-peek-inside-fontinalis-one-of-detroits-best-known-young-venture-firms/">bet on mobility </a>as an investment thesis; there’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/bloomscape-detroit-profile/">thriving garden startup</a>; and there’s a hardware company that, despite remote work, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/hardware-is-still-hard-in-the-motor-city/">finding space to scale</a>:</p>

<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about Tiger Global, IPOs and a few exciting upcoming events. Make sure to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> to hang during the week.</p>
<h2><strong>Tiger Global has a spending problem </strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">This week on Equity</a>, we talked about Tiger Global’s aggressive investment approach and what it could mean for early-stage firms and founders.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>One of the reasons Tiger Global is feeling spendy is that it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/"> just closed one of the biggest venture funds ever</a>. In 2020, the firm closed $3.75 billion in capital commitments. In 2021, it nearly doubled its own record, with $6.7 billion raised for its latest fund.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto’s Coinbase moment</strong></h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">Coinbase went public</a> this week. The company opened at $381 per share, valuing the exchange at nearly $100 billion. It was a massive exit for the company, which underwent scrutiny last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">when it banned politics at work.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>It’s fairly obvious that Coinbase’s successful IPO was a big moment for fintech and crypto startups, as well as the decentralized finance movement. My colleagues Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim dug into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/ ">how the crypto ripple effect</a> could look from the perspective of a few venture capitalists. There are too many good bits for me to choose an excerpt, so read it for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/ ">yourself here</a>, and a take sneak peek below:</p>
<blockquote><p>So while there is an ocean of bullish sentiment that the Coinbase listing will lead to rising venture capital investment into crypto startups, there’s also some caution to be had; how much of the growing market that Coinbase can capture and control is not yet clear, though IVP’s Loverro was very bullish during our interview about the company’s expanding feature set — things like staking Tezos, or buying Uniswap. Its backers think that Coinbase is well-positioned to absorb future market upside in its niche.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the second episode of our new podcast <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found</a>, our guest is Brie Code. Code is the founder and CEO of TRU LUV, a startup based out of Toronto that has its roots in the game industry, but that is taking a radically different approach to designing interactive experiences based on a historically-overlooked motivating paradigm called &#8216;tend-and-befriend,&#8217; an alternative to the &#8216;fight-or-flight&#8217; response aimed at by most AAA game studios.</p>
<p>Code&#8217;s startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/mobile-developer-tru-luv-enlists-investors-to-help-build-a-more-inclusive-alternative-to-gaming/"> developed #SelfCare, a mobile app that encourages users to explore a variety of interactive experience</a>s that are meant to do more than simply encourage them to engage in competitive behavior either with other players, or with computer-controlled antagonists. The motivation for creating this kind of thing for Code came from recognizing its absence in the existing market, and identifying a huge demand gap that just wasn&#8217;t being addressed. Building on her expertise in the game industry engineering interactions for non-player characters (NPCs) and her exploration of academic research on the subject of &#8216;tend-and-befriend,&#8217; Code set up to build a venture-scalable business to define a new category of entertainment.</p>
<p>TRU LUV&#8217;s first touchpoint with users may be its app, but the startup has big ambitions that extend all the way to a larger mission of &#8220;healing our relationship with technology.&#8221; Chatting with the founder behind that pursuit reveals how deeply that mission runs both with her, and her startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We hope you get as much out of this deep and engrossing discussion as we did, and don&#8217;t forget to subscribe in <a href="http://apple.co/found">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, or your <a href="http://pod.link/found">podcast app of choice</a>.

<p>At TechCrunch&#8217;s Detroit City Spotlight this week, I sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/RaeWitte">Rae Witte</a>, the journalist behind the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">StockX EC-1</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s EC-1 push allows individual authors to go deep on a particular company. And as StockX has been headquartered in Detroit since its inception, we took the chance to dig into our reporting in front of our friends from Motor City.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right or left" >
		<h4 class="block--callout__title">All about StockX</h4>
		
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">Introducing the StockX EC-1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">Origin story: How StockX became the stock market of hype</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-authentication/">Authentication and StockX’s global arms race against fraudsters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stocks-ec1-business/">Where StockX fits in the business of sneakers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-culture/">The consequences of scaling up sneaker culture</a></li>
</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Witte has been covering the now-unicorn, and the larger sneaker beat, for a half decade. That experience helped enrich her reporting arc, giving her more insight into the company&#8217;s business model, founding story and recent growth.</p>
<p>StockX is a behemoth today, having recently been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/sneaker-reseller-stockxs-valuation-jumps-to-3point8-billion-.html">valued at $3.8 billion</a> in a round that was announced this month.</p>
<p>But even before the company added another billion dollars to its valuation, TechCrunch was impressed at its business progress.</p>
<p>Back when the company was worth a mere $2.8 billion, we called its then-current round of capital &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">pre-IPO money</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, of course, we asked Witte at the end of the conversation when we should expect to see not just an EC-1 from StockX, but an S-1 as well. Soon, we reckon.</p>
<p>Hit play above to enjoy a behind-the-scenes chat about the company. For more, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">here&#8217;s the EC-1 itself</a>, which Witte absolutely crushed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of sustained growth, the pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/11/camping-glamping-coronavirus-americans">supercharged the outdoor recreation industry</a>. Startups that provide services like camper vans, private campsites and trail-finding apps became relevant to millions of new users when COVID-19 shut down indoor recreation, building on an existing boom in outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>Startups like Outdoorsy, AllTrails, Cabana, Hipcamp, Kibbo and Lowergear Outdoors have seen significant growth, but to keep it going, consumers who discovered a fondness for the great outdoors during the pandemic must turn it into a lifelong interest.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Outdoorsy, AllTrails, Cabana, Hipcamp, Kibbo and Lowergear Outdoors have seen significant growth, but to keep it going, consumers who discovered a fondness for the great outdoors during the pandemic must turn it into a lifelong interest.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Social media, increased environmentalism and high urbanization were already fueling a boom in popularity. There was a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190424005301/en/Camping-is-on-the-Rise-in-North-America-with-More-People-Heading-Outdoors-and-More-Often">72% increase</a> in people who camp more than three times a year between 2014 and 2019, mostly spurred by young millennials, young families with kids and nonwhite participants.</p>
<p>But 2020 was a different animal: After months of shelter-in-place orders, widespread shutdowns and physical distancing, outdoors became the only location for safe socializing. In South Dakota, the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/09/06/camping-rises-popularity-amid-covid-19-travel-concerns-south-dakota/5702412002/">Lewis and Clark Recreation Area</a> saw a 59% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020. In the pandemic year, consumers spent<a href="https://outdoorindustry.org/advocacy/2020-policy-platform/#:~:text=Americans'%20passion%20for%20outdoor%20recreation,local%20tax%20revenue%20each%20year."> $887 billion </a>on outdoor recreation according to the Outdoor Industry Association, more than pharmaceuticals and fuel combined.</p>
<p>And it’s going to continue to grow. Hiking equipment alone is supposed to reach a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hiking-gear--equipment-market-size-worth-7-4-billion-by-2027-grand-view-research-inc-301044055.html">$7.4 billion market size</a> by 2027, a 6.3% compound annual growth rate. Camping and caravanning is having an even more drastic moment. Without international travel, vacations shifted from flights to exotic resorts to domestic road trips, self-contained rentals and camping. In 2020, the market for camping and caravanning was almost <a href="https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/camping-and-caravanning-market">$40 billion </a>and is predicted to rise 13% to just over $45 billion this year.</p>
<p>After the initial and extreme drop-off in engagement early as national parks closed, private camping sites shut down and domestic travel ceased, many outdoor startups have had a breakout year. <a href="https://www.outdoorsy.com/">Outdoorsy</a>, the peer-to-peer camper van rental marketplace, said it saw 44% of all bookings in the company&#8217;s history in 2020.</p>
<p>Campsite booking platform <a href="https://www.hipcamp.com/">Hipcamp</a> said it sent three times as much money to landowners in 2020 as compared to 2019. And it’s not just experienced outdoor veterans taking advantage of the work-from-home lifestyle: in 2020, <a href="https://cabana.life/">Cabana</a>, a camper van rental startup, said 70% of its customers had never rented a camper van or an RV before and another 26% had only done it once.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://oia.outdoorindustry.org/l/51282/2021-03-29/dg2r2l/51282/1617064883iebKFnqB/New_Outdoor_Participant__COVID_and_Beyond____FINAL.pdf">report</a> commissioned by the Outdoor Industry Association showed that the most popular outdoor activities were ones that people could do close to home, not the traveling kind Hipcamp, Cabana and Outdoorsy traffic in. The three most popular outdoor activities for newbies: walking, running and bicycling.</p>
<p>But the pandemic did create a small boost for camping, climbing, backpacking and kayaking; fueled by an increase in women, younger, more ethnically diverse, urban and slightly less wealthy people pushing into the outdoors. This class of outdoor startups will need to engage the new demographic shift to capitalize on the pandemic’s outdoor boom because, according to the report, a quarter of those who started new outdoor activities during the pandemic don’t plan on continuing once it’s over.</p>
<h2>Startups are increasing accessibility to the outdoors</h2>
<p>But getting into the outdoors can be overwhelming: there’s gear to buy, skills to learn, exploring unfamiliar areas and the added stressor of safety. Outdoor startups are working to lower the barrier to entry to help grow their businesses.</p>
<p>“I think anytime you have like 2,000 articles with two dozen tips on how to use a product, that tells me that it is really, really too hard to use,” said Cabana founder Scott Kubly. “To me, that says there’s nothing but friction in this process. If you want to build something that’s mainstream, you need to make it super consistent and really easy to use.”</p>
<p>Kubly said only half a percent of the U.S. population takes a rental van or RV trip each year. Planning an outdoor adventure can be time-consuming — choosing a location, finding an open campsite, planning meals and water, and figuring out dump stations for trash or septic. That planning is multiplied tenfold if you are going for a road trip or backpacking and need to find new places every other night.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> combined</a>  $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, the news is heavily Apple-centric. The company is hosting an event next week, where we may get some new devices and form factors, as well as AirTags (maybe!). Plus, Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency is still top of mind for many developers. So this week, we&#8217;re looking at some initial ATT data that has some surprises, among other things.</p>

<h3>Apple&#8217;s Spring Loaded event arrives next week</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2137829" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137829" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137829" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg 2222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137829" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/apples-next-event-is-april-20/">announced</a> its plans to host a &#8220;Spring Loaded&#8221; event on April 20th, where it&#8217;s expected to make a handful of updates. While nothing is for certain &#8212; this is Apple, after all &#8212; rumors are pointing toward an updated iPad Pro lineup, perhaps with Apple&#8217;s Mini LED displays. A new iPad Mini could also be on the way, as it&#8217;s not been refreshed for two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost">Bloomberg had earlier reported</a> new iPads were coming this spring, with a refreshed iPad Pro line sporting a faster processor and better cameras, in 11 and 12.9-inch sizes, as well as an iPad mini will a larger screen size.</p>
<p>But there are also hints that we might finally see Apple&#8217;s AirTags&#8217; unveiling at long last. This not-so-secretive initiative was already found referenced in iOS code and in one of Apple&#8217;s own YouTube videos. And it&#8217;s been the subject of congressional hearings, as competitor Tile argued that Apple was leveraging the power of its ecosystem to give its own products an advantage. As a concession, Apple opened up access to the &#8220;Find My&#8221; app, which AirTags will also use, to third-party manufacturers. But Tile was not among the partners Apple introduced as the program and updated Find My app officially rolled out. We understand that&#8217;s because Tile wants to continue to own the relationship between its customers via its own iOS app, not have a third-party in between &#8212; and especially not Apple. There&#8217;s still a lot that&#8217;s not confirmed about Apple&#8217;s AirTags &#8212; like price point, or even what final design Apple may have settled on, so this could be a fun unveiling.</p>
<p>Apple may use the time to add on more surprises, too, like a third-generation version of AirPods or refreshed Apple TV. We expect Apple will also officially launch iOS 14.5, the big update with App Tracking Transparency, which has been a longer beta cycle.</p>
<h3>A surprising report on ATT consent rates</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2140001" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140001" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140001" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg 1460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?resize=768,655 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?resize=680,580 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.57.04-PM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140001" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AppsFlyer</p></div></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/att-opt-in-rates-higher/">new report on App Tracking Transparency</a> (ATT) has yielded some interesting results. The new iOS 14 privacy feature will pop up a permissions request on users&#8217; devices, asking them if they&#8217;d allow the app to track their activity. Most expected that users would almost universally say &#8220;No&#8221; to this request, which is why the mobile adtech industry is in chaos, with some companies even trying to figure out if they could work around the change that makes the existing ad identifier, the IDFA, obsolete.</p>
<p>But an AppsFlyer study found that opt-in rates for being tracked were much higher than anyone would have expected. The industry was forecasting opt-in rates anywhere from 2% to 20%, but were figuring things would more likely be in the single digits. So imagine everyone&#8217;s surprise when AppsFlyer found that opt-in rates were at a 28% average per app and a median of 32% (meaning about half the apps were exceeding 32%!).</p>
<p>The study was not a small sampling, either. The company counted 13,260,824 times when a prompt was shown to the end-user and found that 5,495,084 times (or 41%) the user tapped the &#8220;Allow&#8221; button. This took place in March 2021 across over 300 apps in multiple categories, including both apps and games.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140003" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140003" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?resize=768,705 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-3.58.34-PM.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140003" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AppsFlyer</p></div></p>
<p>Of the 7,765,740 cases when tracking was denied, AppsFlyer said it was actually counting implicit &#8220;No&#8217;s&#8221; from users who previously enabled Limit Ad Tracking (LAT) on their devices in previous iOS versions. Since they had already said they wanted to limit ads, they don&#8217;t see the ATT prompt and are classified as denied.</p>
<p>The report found the opt-in rates were very different between apps and games, at 42% and 30%, respectively. This is due to lower brand affinity in gaming, it said. Larger apps also had higher opt-in rates. The top 10% (by device count) had a 50% higher rate than the bottom 10%.</p>
<p>Of course, we should caution that this initial data is preliminary and based off data collected from early adopters. This may not represent the industry at large. In other words, opt-in rates could certainly still change when Apple begins to officially enforce ATT with the release of iOS 14.5.</p>
<p>However, what could be working here is the use of something known as the pre-ATT prompt, which basically means gating Apple&#8217;s dialogue between the developer&#8217;s own prompt, that they can show at an appropriate time with their own messaging. By explaining to users that by opting in they may see more relevant content or help to keep the app free, users may be more likely to opt in, AppsFlyer suggested.</p>

<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Apple</h3>
<p><strong>Apple device rumors!</strong> Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera">2022 iPhones</a> will feature a 48-megapixel camera, 8K video and come in only 6.1&#8243; and 6.7&#8243; sizes (no more 5.4&#8243; Mini). Also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/14/apple-ar-headset-cameras/">predicted</a> is an AR headset with 15 cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s legal battle with Epic Games in Australian courts <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/">was temporarily put on pause</a></strong> while the U.S. case proceeds. Apple argued that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction in the U.S., while Epic says Apple&#8217;s anti-competitive behavior should be tried under Australian law as well. A judge ordered the case to be temporarily suspended for three months while the U.S. suit is underway.</p>
<p><strong>Senate Judiciary Committee leaders Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) put pressure on Apple to provide a witness</strong> for an upcoming hearing on app store competition after it looked like Apple might bow out. But this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/apple-and-google-senate-antitrust-app-store-hearing/">the company committed to sending a representative</a> to the Senate antitrust hearing, which Google will also attend. The hearing will focus on the tech giants&#8217; control over &#8220;the cost, distribution, and availability of mobile applications on consumers, app developers, and competition.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/apple-witness-says-company-would-need-to-modify-software-hardware-to-support-third-party-app-stores?utm_medium=rss">filed an expert witness report</a> for its U.S. legal battle with Epic Games where the witness stated that Apple would have to redesign its hardware and software in order to make the iPhone interoperable with alternative app stores</strong> outside of its own. Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney tweeted the statement was &#8220;baloney&#8221; and noted that Apple already has a program that allows users to install apps from the web, the Apple Enterprise Program. Only contractual obligations prevent such a mechanism from being used for consumer apps.</p>

<h3>Google</h3>
<p><strong>Due to U.S. trade restrictions, China manufacturer Huawei isn&#8217;t able to use Google Mobile Services (GMS) on their smartphone</strong>, so the company came up with an alternative, Huawei Mobile Services (HMS). Now it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-gms-hms-apps-solution-1217782/">launched an open-source Choice SDK</a> that will allow app developers to turn their GMS apps into HMS apps more easily. The SDK currently supports features like location, sign-in, analytics, maps and messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Google Assistant, which is integrated with Android devices and available as a standalone app, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/14/google-assistant-find-silent-iphone/">this week rolled out new features</a></strong>. The AI voice assistant is now able to locate and ring misplaced and silenced iPhones instead of just Android devices. To do so, the device places a regular call to your mobile numbers. It can also complete restaurant takeout orders and design Routines.</p>
<p><strong>Android leaks!</strong> Reportedly, Android 12 may bring enhanced privacy controls, according to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-features-leak/#android12leakclipboardprompt">XDA Developers</a> and a set of leaked Android 12 screenshots they published. Specifically, Google is copying the iOS feature that alerts you when an app you&#8217;re using is accessing the clipboard. It&#8217;s also working on enhanced notification permissions that let you choose what type of alerts you want to receive, like &#8220;real-time&#8221; or &#8220;conversations.&#8221;</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>TikTok plans to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/tiktok-previews-coming-ad-and-product-display-options/598336/">launch a range of new e-commerce-focused ad products</a>,</strong> including Collection Ads, which will enable brands to combine their product catalog listings and branded videos; and Dynamic Product Ads, which will automatically retarget users with relevant products according to their actions on publishers&#8217; apps and websites.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon-owned Zappos <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/zappos-is-tapping-influencers-to-host-shopping-livestreams/">teamed up with</a> streaming startup BuyWith</strong> to add livestream shopping, led by influencers.</p>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s Shopping app for Android and iOS <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-shopping-app/">is shutting down</a>,</strong> as Google has expanded shopping features in Search and on YouTube in the two years since the Express app was rebranded as Shopping.</p>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<p><strong>Gucci Beauty <a href="https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/gucci-beauty-rolls-out-snapchat-try-on-lens-to-back-its-new-line/">launched a new Snapchat lens</a></strong> that lets users virtually try-on its Rouge De Beauté Brilliant hybrid lipstick and other makeup, including foundation and eyeshadows.</p>
<p><strong>Snap also launched an <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/766b328387eb477a872432012656de2d">interactive Lens</a> in the main Snapchat Lens Carousel for all Snapchatters in the U.S. that highlights five AR monuments from the Monumental Perspectives project</strong>. The company had brought artists and Snap Lens Creators together to create the five AR monuments to celebrate diverse histories across Los Angeles, in an effort to offer more inclusive perspectives from communities across the region.</p>

<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">is launching a new test</a> that will allow you to choose if you want to hide &#8220;Likes,&#8221; and a Facebook test will follow.</strong> In the test, users will get to decide what works best for them — either choosing to see the Like counts on others’ posts, or not. Users will also be able to turn off Like counts on their own posts, if they choose. Facebook additionally confirmed it will begin to test a similar experience on its own social network. The test aims to balance the feedback from those who rely on Likes as a metric that enables them to prove their value to advertisers, and those who are impacted by the anxiety of chasing Likes.</p>
<p><strong>Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381728/discord-nsfw-servers-blocked-ios-age-gate-restrictions">announced a policy change</a> that says all adult content should be kept behind an NSFW warning</strong> and that all NSFW communities and channels will be blocked on iOS devices.</p>
<p><strong>Reddit is said to be exploring a Clubhouse-like voice chat feature</strong>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-clubhouse-voice-chat/">Mashable reported</a>. The development is said to be in the early stages. Reddit didn&#8217;t reply to requests for comments, the report said.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook says it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/facebook-to-test-new-business-discovery-features-in-u-s-news-feed/">will test new business discovery features</a> in the U.S. News Feed</strong>.

<p><strong>Thirty-five consumer advocacy groups and 64 child development experts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/consumer-groups-and-child-development-experts-petition-facebook-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-plan/">co-signed a letter to Facebook</a> asking the company to reconsider its plans to launch an Instagram version for children under the age of 13, arguing that social media has several risk factors</strong> for children and adolescents, related to both physical health and overall well-being.</p>
<p>They also launched a <a href="https://ccfc.salsalabs.org/noinstagramforkids/index.html">petition</a> anyone can sign. Despite the concerns being raised, Instagram’s plans to compete for younger users will not likely be impacted by the outcry. Already, Instagram’s top competitor in social media today — TikTok — has developed an experience for kids under 13. In fact, it was forced to age-gate its app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">as a result of its settlement</a> with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which had <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/318207/musically-referred-to-ftc-for-allegedly-violating.html">investigated</a> Musical.ly (the app that became TikTok) for violations of the U.S. children’s privacy law <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook, too, could be in a similar situation where it has to age-gate Instagram in order to properly direct its existing underage users to a COPPA-compliant experience. At the very least, Facebook has grounds to argue that it shouldn’t have to boot the under-13 crowd off its app, since TikTok did not. And the FTC’s fines, even when historic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">barely make a dent</a> in tech giants’ revenues.</p>
<h3>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<p><strong>Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/clubhouse-rolls-out-payments-to-over-60k-creators-following-initial-test/">rolls out payments to over 60K creators</a> </strong>following its initial test launched earlier this month. To send a payment, users can visit a creator’s profile, then tap on the button at the bottom that says “Send Money.” Clubhouse says 100% of the payments go directly to creators.</p>
<p><strong>The TV version of the Google Play Movies &amp; TV app <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/google-play-movies-roku-samsung-lg-vizio/">will shut down</a> </strong>on Roku, LG, Samsung and Vizio TVs in June, while users&#8217; purchases will be migrated to YouTube.</p>
<h3>Health &amp; Fitness</h3>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/apple-wants-cavalier-800-million-coronavirus-app-suit-dismissed">filed for dismissal of an $800 million lawsuit</a> brought on by a developer who claimed the App Store rejected a coronavirus app for &#8220;no good reason.&#8221;</strong> The App Store policy says it&#8217;s only accepting coronavirus apps from &#8220;recognized institutions such as government, hospital, insurance company, NGO, or a university.&#8221; The developer argues they had a medical doctor (a former NASA cardiologist) on their team.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/tiktok-funds-first-episodic-public-health-series-viral-from-nowthis/">funded its first episodic public health series</a>, &#8220;VIRAL,&#8221; from NowThis</strong>. The series will feature interviews with public health experts and a live Q&amp;A session focused on answering questions about the pandemic. The partnership represents TikTok’s first-ever funding of an episodic series from a publisher, though TikTok has previously funded creator content.</p>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s Digital Wellbeing app <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-rolling-out-heads-up-digital-wellbeing/">added a new feature called &#8220;Heads Up&#8221;</a> i</strong>n its Settings which will remind Pixel device owners to look up when they&#8217;re using their phone while out walking. The app requires permission to users&#8217; physical activity and location.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook began <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/">sharing state vaccine info in the News Feed</a> to let people know when they&#8217;re eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine in their state,</strong> when the general public is eligible in their state and links to their state health department and Facebook&#8217;s Vaccine Finder.</p>
<h3>Dating apps</h3>
<p><strong>Match-owned dating app <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/hinge-levels-up-virtual-dating-with-launch-of-video-prompts/">Hinge launched &#8220;video prompts&#8221;</a> in its virtual dating feature</strong>. The prompts help daters gauge compatibility with debate topics, which can help break the ice and make the virtual dating experience feel less awkward.</p>
<p><strong>Leading dating app <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/tinder-snags-former-pizza-hut-cmo-as-new-top-marketer/">Tinder hires</a> former Yum Brands (Pizza Hut and KFC) CMO George Felix as its new chief marketing officer.</strong> Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone says Felix &#8220;delivers iconic brand positioning and outstanding results&#8221; but does so &#8220;in new ways with very different brands.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p><strong>Gay dating site and app Manhunt, which has 6 million members, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/gay-dating-site-manhunt-hacked/">confirmed a data breach</a></strong> in February where a hacker gained access to the company&#8217;s accounts database. The hacker was able to acquire usernames, emails and passwords for a subset (11%) of its users.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers discovered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/04/10/shock-new-warning-for-millions-of-whatsapp-users-on-apple-iphone-and-google-android-phones/?sh=1e8bb6b27585">a WhatsApp security risk</a></strong> that allows a remote hacker to deactivate WhatsApp on your phone and stop you from getting back in, even if you had two-factor enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison said the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378302/personal-information-1-million-clubhouse-users-leaked-privacy-security">report of a data breach was false</a> </strong>and that user data was not leaked, calling the article that reported it &#8220;clickbait.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Security researchers found that the popular APKPure app</strong>, which helps users install older or discontinued Android apps from outside the Play Store, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/apkpure-app-malicious-adware/">contained malicious adware</a>. The most recent app version was siphoning data from users&#8217; devices and pushed ads to the lockscreen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for adware operators.</p>
<p><strong>Joker malware <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/joker-malware-infects-over-500-000-huawei-android-devices/">impacted over 500,000 Huawei users&#8217; devices</a> </strong>after they downloaded infected apps from the company&#8217;s official Android app store. Researchers found 10 seemingly harmless apps in AppGallery &#8212; like virtual keyboards, a camera, a launcher, a messenger, a sticker collection and more &#8212; that were infected with the malicious code.</p>
<p><strong>Customer data from the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/">ParkMobile mobile parking app was discovered being sold</a> online</strong>. The data included customer email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, license plate numbers, hashed passwords and mailing addresses for 21 million customers. ParkMobile attributed the breach to &#8220;a cybersecurity incident linked to a vulnerability in a third-party software that we use.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p><strong>In legal <a href="https://www.mobileappchildprivacysettlements.com">settlements</a>, Disney, Viacom and 10 adtech firms, including Twitter&#8217;s MoPub, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/technology/advertising-children-privacy.html">agreed to remove certain advertising software</a> from children&#8217;s apps due to privacy violations</strong>. The companies had placed tracking software in kids&#8217; apps without parents&#8217; knowledge or consent, the class-action cases had stated. SDK defendants also include AdColony, Chartboost, Flurry, InMob, ironSource, Tapjoy, Vungle, Unity Technologies, Comscore (Full Circle Studies), and Upsight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Third-party hardware integration can be a tricky thing. Peloton this week <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/16/apple-vs-peloton-battle-brewing-gymkit-removed-on-peloton-bootcamp-classes/">raised some eyebrows</a> by dropping Apple GymKit compatibility for its Bike Bootcamp program. Users were, naturally, quick to react. The situation left some wondering whether the move was a direct response to Apple&#8217;s recent entry into the home exercise market with Fitness+.</p>
<p>A Peloton spokesperson offered the following statement to TechCrunch, “Apple GymKit is designed to work with equipment-based cardio workouts. However, Peloton recently implemented GymKit with Bike Bootcamp, a multi-disciplinary class type that combines strength and cardio, which the feature does not support. Members can still use GymKit to sync their cycling-only workouts to their Apple Watch from the Bike+.”</p>
<p>The comment appears to reflect one of the bigger issues with its initial GymKit implementation. Designed with the gym in mind, Apple’s program engages with specific exercise equipment. In other words, use the integration on the treadmill and the Watch specifically goes to work tracking run metrics. Use it with a bike and it tracks cycling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A program like Bike Bootcamp complicates things, adding to the mix things like weightlifting. The implementation was likely outside of third-party guidelines around GymKit implementation. The bigger issue for Peloton owners is that GymKit was a primary distinguisher between the standard Peloton bike and the Bike+ &#8212; two products with a <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/bikes/compare">$500 gulf between them</a>.</p>
<p>Truth is, for now at least, working together is still a net positive for both parties. Apple may have its own fitness platform, but Peloton has a huge footprint &#8212; one that likely has significant overlap with Apple Watch users. GymKit may have been developed with gyms in mind, but people haven’t visited the gym much in the past year, and there’s a reasonable expectation that the industry might never entirely bounce back.</p>
<p>For Peloton’s part, it’s probably good to play nice with the company that utterly dominates the smartwatch category.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Just shy of a year ago, I sent an email to our global fund manager partners and to our direct portfolio CEOs titled &#8220;<a href="https://capria.vc/updates/only-the-decisive-survive/">Only the decisive survive</a>.&#8221; At that time, not many outside of China were concerned about COVID-19. However, I was obsessed.</p>
<p>Hearing stories from fund manager friends with operations in China, I knew things were worse than what the Chinese press were telling the world. And I live only five miles south of the location of the first COVID death in the U.S. The pandemic was accelerating exponentially, and I wanted to get all of our partners to open their eyes to the risks and prepare as well as they could.</p>
<p>I’m not writing with that level of intensity or urgency this time, but I am concerned. We all need to be taking precautionary measures, not just in light of COVID, but to ensure our firms can continue to thrive when faced with unexpected tragedy.</p>

<p>My partner Susana invested in 90 funds over 20 years — she’s seen everything from motorcycle accidents to depression take out fund managers and CEOs. Life works that way sometimes, and it’s not always someone else. It’s the &#8220;What happens if I get hit by a bus scenario?” In this case, the bus happens to be a global pandemic.</p>
<p>One of our funds in Asia recently reported COVID cases in three CEOs among their 23 companies. While developed market infections and deaths are trending down, many countries are seeing serious new outbreaks, and some, like <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/brazil?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend">Brazil</a>, are doing badly.</p>
<p>Pandemic forecasting site IHME predicts a growing caseload across <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/global/sub-saharan-africa?view=infections-testing&amp;tab=trend&amp;test=infections">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/global/east-asia-and-pacific">East Asia and Pacific regions</a>. The LAC region is trending down overall, but some countries, including Colombia, are expected to experience a second (or third) wave of infections.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/13/how-well-will-vaccines-work">Economist</a> said in mid-February, &#8220;Coronavirus is not done with humanity yet.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Planning for your fund</h2>
<p>A month or so ago, we were trying to move forward with an investment in a fund in Africa with whom we had been speaking and doing due diligence for a few months. They went radio silent for over two weeks. We didn’t know whether to be miffed, concerned for their health, or what.</p>

Still, the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit got a lot right ahead of its highly successful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">direct listing</a> this week, including, seemingly, inviting in former federal prosecutor Katie Haun to join its board in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/kathryn-haun-joins-coinbase-board-of-directors-65b4d4c4e65f">2017</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Haun had just spent 11 years working for the Justice Department, handling cases relating to violent murders and organized crime and, later, the fast-growing world of cryptocurrencies. In fact, as part of her job, Haun had gotten to know Coinbase and other up-and-coming startups to better understand digital currencies and decentralized systems. Because Haun, who won every case she argued, was ready for a change, when Brian Armstrong reached out about a formal role, she said yes. (A year later, Andreessen Horowitz, which wrote its first check to Coinbase in 2013, separately brought her aboard as the venture firm&#8217;s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17501602/andreessen-horowitz-katie-haun-crypto-fund-launch-women-venture-capital-diversity">first woman general partner.</a>)</p>
<p>The combination has proved powerful, and lucrative. As an independent board member at the outset, Haun was given shares for her service that are reportedly now worth roughly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-ipo-brian-armstrong-who-got-rich-public-offering-2021-3">$150 million</a> (a16z&#8217;s stake is valued at more than $11 billion). Meanwhile, Haun &#8212; who recently renewed her board term &#8212; says the company&#8217;s most impactful days are still ahead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked yesterday with Haun about Coinbase&#8217;s valuation, its evolution from here and her work with a16z&#8217;s crypto fund, which she co-leads with longtime general partner and fellow Coinbase board member Chris Dixon, and where the team has likely &#8220;seen and done more deals in the last couple months than in the last couple years,&#8221; she said. She also noted that a16z has been pouring the majority of its money into tokens. Our chat has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were working on these intense cases, including murder trials and at some point, your superiors at the Justice Department offer you the chance to figure out what Bitcoin is all about. How did that lead you to Coinbase?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I actually came to know Coinbase through some of the work I was doing on crypto cases in the government in the early days. I founded the U.S. government&#8217;s first cryptocurrency task force out of the Justice Department and part of our job was to go meet with companies or entrepreneurs in the space and get to know what they were up to and how we could work with them. Of course, as with any industry, the government&#8217;s objectives didn&#8217;t always align with the crypto industry&#8217;s. But sometimes there were synergies [and] sometimes they might need to reach someone in the government at one of these companies. Coinbase was not the only crypto company that I was interfacing with in those government days. There were many others. But that&#8217;s how I first came to know it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because not everyone is going to know the specifics of your career, you played a role in prosecuting Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and also discovering two corrupt federal agents involved in that case. Is that right?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I actually did not prosecute Ross Ulbricht, I did not prosecute the Silk Road case. What I did prosecute is what we&#8217;ll call the twist to the Silk Road case, and that was that a couple of the agents on one of the task forces that was investigating Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road actually turned out to be double agents working both against the government while being federal agents. When I [first received] a tip that we had a rogue federal agent, I thought it was a conspiracy theory. So I thought I would go look into that, mostly to just clear this individual&#8217;s name.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Was this a career federal employee?</strong></p>
<p>KH: Yes, this was a federal agent for well over a decade, and it turned out there were two, and they weren&#8217;t working together&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which is even weirder!</strong></p>
<p>KH: Right? The other one was also a career federal agent, which is extremely rare. It happens on TV, where you have corrupt police or law enforcement. But I can tell you that in reality, having been a federal prosecutor for over a decade, this was certainly a first for me. And so I looked into the high level, and what we found was that, let&#8217;s just say hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time &#8212; now it would be tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars at today&#8217;s prices of cryptocurrency &#8212; moving around. When we looked into it initially, we thought it must just be some poorly backstopped undercover operation. But the more we looked at it, the transfer patterns were not making sense, and they turned out to be going to personal accounts, which then really piqued our interest.</p>

<p>[In fact] companies like Coinbase [and] other exchanges that kept compliant records were instrumental to our ability to solve that case because of the information that we were getting from those exchanges, but also, the blockchain itself. Without the blockchain, I can definitively say we never would have solved that case. Those agents would still be federal agents today. Had they just been using wires or fiat, we would never have been able to solve the case because they were going to financial institutions across the globe and flashing the badge and saying &#8216;delete these records.&#8217; They could not do that on the blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In terms of traceability, a16z has investments in some NFT companies, including <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, a blockchain company working with the NBA and others to create NFTs, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opensea-raise-andreessen-horowitz">OpenSea</a>, which is itself an NFT marketplace. Can I ask what you think of the potential for people to use NFTs to move money illegally from point A to B? It&#8217;s something I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/nft_users/">wrote about</a> recently. </strong></p>
<p>KH: Money laundering is something I prosecuted at the Justice Department; I prosecuted one of the largest ever, if not the largest ever, online money laundering case: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/dealbook/bitcoin-exchange-was-a-nexus-of-crime-indictment-says.html">case against BTC-E</a>. We also led an investigation into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/business/apparent-theft-at-mt-gox-shakes-bitcoin-world.html">Mount Gox hack</a> and we harnessed blockchain technology to help solve those cases, ironically.</p>
<p>I did read your article, Connie, and I found it really interesting, because at first I thought, &#8216;Oh, yeah, NFTs&#8217; and &#8216;let&#8217;s see how could criminals exploit this,&#8217; because the thing about criminal actors is they are often early adopters of new technologies. I&#8217;ve said before, they&#8217;re beta testers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brian Armstrong&#8217;s new problem: 60-plus free agents&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/embed/#?secret=7ee15VXmZb" data-secret="7ee15VXmZb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I think when you think about money laundering, the thing you have to step back and realize is that 99.9% of money laundering crimes with fiat today succeed, which is staggering. I think there&#8217;s this perception out there that &#8216;Oh, when wires or fiat money or physical goods are used, money launderers can&#8217;t do their thing,&#8217; and that&#8217;s just completely contrary to reality.</p>
<p>What I would say is that crypto is a step-level function improvement. The reason I say that is because it leaves these what I call digital breadcrumbs in a way that the physical world or your cash, even wires, by the way, though wires are somewhat digital, cash, physical goods don&#8217;t quite leave. With NFTs, I think that ultimately actually it makes it easier for investigators to trace because of those digital breadcrumbs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Speaking of NFTs and some of your <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation">firm&#8217;s deals</a>, how would you describe your pacing right now?</strong></p>
<p>KH: We&#8217;re deploying currently out of our second crypto fund. And I think it&#8217;s really exciting to start seeing a lot of these things work and capture mainstream attention. And just frankly, there&#8217;s been a lot of launches also in the last six months. So that&#8217;s also been really exciting. So although the pace is definitely frenetic, it&#8217;s an incredibly exciting time in the space. Obviously, yesterday was a milestone for Coinbase but also just for the entire crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>In terms of pace and how many deals we&#8217;re seeing, I would say that we&#8217;ve seen and done more deals in the last couple months than in the last couple years, and stay tuned for some of our announcements there, because we&#8217;ve done a lot in this last quarter and they haven&#8217;t all yet been announced. There&#8217;s really an explosion of activity in the space.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also doubling down on investments we&#8217;ve made years ago. You mentioned Dapper Labs. The Andreessen Horowitz Crypto Funds have invested in Dapper Labs several times over the years, including out of our first crypto fund, so it&#8217;s just really exciting to see now all of the progress that team has made.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does the process of evaluating these crypto deals differ in comparison with traditional startups?</strong></p>
<p>KH: Some categories are the same and some are completely different. One thing we always look for is a founding team  that has a real vision and that can execute; Coinbase is a tremendous case study in that. We also consider the total addressable market. And we look at not just the product and tech but also its defensibility. Could others come along and quickly take over this idea? Those are some of the characteristics that are the same.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different in crypto is first, regulatory and compliance. Have code audits been done, [have] vulnerabilities [been] found? What&#8217;s your plan for security, particularly if you&#8217;re talking about areas like decentralized finance.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also [focused on] token economics. What we&#8217;re investing in at Andreessen Horowitz Crypto now largely is tokens. Because we&#8217;re a [registered investment advisor], we have that flexibility. We still think there are plenty of [opportunities] that merit equity investment; Coinbase is a prime example of an equity investment, not a token investment, but we&#8217;re increasingly doing a lot in the token space. I would say, the majority of our funds are deployed in tokens. And when you&#8217;re talking about tokens, you want to have really thought through token economics at the outset. Has the team set aside enough tokens for the community? Once the protocol is live, what does that look like? Are they going to Airdrop tokens? What&#8217;s their go-to-market strategy? Are they incentivizing early employees with tokens? So I would say the token economic model is something that we look at very heavily.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you saying that the firm is looking at buying tokens, meaning buying slugs of currency, versus investing in foundational technology?</strong></p>
<p>KH: We see tokens as foundational technology because we see these protocols, in many cases, as foundational technology.</p>
<p>I think what you might be asking me is, are we investing in the tokens versus the equity of a particular company, and the answer is very much yes. I could say the vast majority of our crypto funds are deployed into the tokens themselves, the assets themselves now [including] Bitcoin or Ethereum, for example. Then apart from that, we hold tokens in a number of different protocols that we acquired just through acquiring tokens &#8212; not because we owned equity in a company that distributed the tokens.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As more artists and musicians turn their attention to NFTs, so, likely, do money launderers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/nft_users/embed/#?secret=B3ABuWg22O" data-secret="B3ABuWg22O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In some instances, we have owned equity, where a team has then created a token, and we get token rights as part of our original equity investment. But increasingly, what we&#8217;re seeing is the ability to just go buy tokens. We can buy them over the counter and we are definitely doing that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of the crypto fund&#8217;s assets are invested directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum? Is it a sizable percentage?</strong></p>
<p>KH: We&#8217;ve never disclosed an actual percentage, but we definitely have a sizable position in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, which I can say because we&#8217;ve disclosed that before. So that&#8217;s really all I&#8217;m comfortable saying.</p>
<p><strong>TC: That Bitcoin is now so valuable has been a boon for Coinbase, which makes most of its revenue off transaction volume. Can you help readers understand how this company is worth $87 billion today? Presumably it won&#8217;t be as reliant on those fees going forward (owing to pressure from rival companies).</strong></p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s definitely true that the company has plans to diversify from just purely transactional revenue, although make no mistake, transactional revenue continues to be an important segment of the business now but also in the future.</p>
<p>However, I think we see diversification away from that in terms of recurring subscriptions or services. The best way to think about Coinbase is that it&#8217;s at the ground floor in some ways, because right now you have 56 million people on the Coinbase platform but well over 100 million people around the globe doing things right now with crypto: buying it, selling, even holding crypto assets. And we really see that as the ground floor because we&#8217;re seeing projects that are enabling entirely new industries.</p>
<p>Within crypto, we&#8217;ve talked about one already: NFTs. There&#8217;s [decentralized finance]. But there&#8217;s just so much more out there, like digital identity.</p>

<p>One of the things we&#8217;ve seen with crypto is that we can&#8217;t always predict where those new behaviors or products and services will lead. I mean, when the iPhone came out, did we think that would lead to behaviors like ride hailing, the gig economy, TikTok streaming? One of the things that we see for Coinbase is that it&#8217;s very well-positioned &#8212; because it&#8217;s a crypto-first company &#8212; to capitalize on all kinds of different behaviors in the crypto economy that we don&#8217;t even yet know about.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of wealth was generated inside of Coinbase this week, with presumably a major divide between the haves and have nots. How does a company in this position deal with that issue?</strong></p>
<p>KH: People who are attracted to Coinbase are attracted for a number of reasons. Economics is certainly one of them. But the candidates I see coming through Coinbase, there&#8217;s something about the vision that attracts them to the vision of the company and to crypto as a movement and as a technology.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that the management team is very much here for the long haul and is very much invested in building the future. At 7:22 a.m. the morning after the offering, [Coinbase sent out an email] saying: &#8220;Okay, on to the next thing, let&#8217;s keep the focus.&#8221; And by the way, the same thing was true when the price of Bitcoin hit $10,000. I just happened to be in the Coinbase offices and the mood was, let&#8217;s keep building.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you comment on whether Andreessen Horowitz sold part of its shares in this week&#8217;s offering and if so, what percentage? I&#8217;m assuming that the firm took some money off the table.</strong></p>
<p>KH: Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t comment on any of that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The winner of NASA&#8217;s Human Landing System (HLS) contract award is SpaceX, which bid $2.9 billion for the privilege of developing the means by which NASA astronauts will return to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo program. SpaceX was in the running alongside Blue Origin and Dynetics, but reportedly undercut both those prospective suppliers considerably with its bid, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>SpaceX proposed using its Starship spacecraft, currently under development, as the landing vehicle for astronauts once they arrive at their lunar destination. The HLS is a key part of NASA&#8217;s Artemis program, which will begin with uncrewed flights, followed by a moon flyby with a human crew, and eventually a human lunar landing at the south pole of the moon, during a mission which had been targeting 2024 as its fly date.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">announced that SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics made up the entirety of its field of approved vendors for bidding on the HLS contracts back in April last year.</a> Since then, both Blue Origin (which bid alongside a &#8220;national team&#8221; that included Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper) and Dynetics have built full-scale models of their system and submitted proposals detailing their plans for the functional versions to NASA for consideration. Meanwhile, SpaceX has been actively testing functional prototypes of its Starship spacecraft in Texas and is also in the process of developing the Super Heavy booster that will propel it to the moon once it&#8217;s ready.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The plan here was for NASA to have chosen all three companies to build out initial versions in order to satisfy the early requirements of the contract, and then ultimately, it was generally thought that the agency would select a couple from the list of three to build human landers, in order to provide it with some flexibility when it comes to means of getting to the lunar surface. That&#8217;s essentially how NASA operated with its Commercial Crew program for the International Space Station, which saw awards for both SpaceX and Boeing to build astronaut transport spacecraft. SpaceX has already qualified and begun to operate its vehicle, and Boeing hopes to bring its option online either late this year or early next.</p>
<p>SpaceX has won a lot of trust at NASA by delivering on the Commercial Crew program with a reliable, reusable human-rated spacecraft in the Crew Dragon. The Post also says that in addition to its attractive pricing, NASA was drawn to Starship&#8217;s flexibility and cargo capacity since it&#8217;s aiming to be able to fly not just humans, but also large quantities of supplies and materials to the moon, and eventually, beyond.</p>
<p>Starship is a long way off from that goal at the moment, however; SpaceX has been quickly developing new iterations in a rapid prototyping approach to its test phase, but the most recent Starship high-altitude flight ended poorly with an explosion prior to landing. Other elements of the test program, however, including showing that Starship can successfully reorient itself in midair and slow its decent for landing, have been more successful on past tests. None of the tests so far have left Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, however, nor have they involved any human flight testing, both of which will require a lot more development before the spacecraft is deemed mission-ready.</p>
<p>SpaceX was also the launch provider chosen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/nasa-picks-spacex-falcon-heavy-for-332m-mission-to-launch-lunar-gateway-components-in-2024/">deliver components of the Lunar Gateway</a> satellite in 2024, working with Maxar, which will produce the actual Power and Propulsion Element and Habitation and Logistics Outpost. These, however, will be delivered via Falcon Heavy, which has already had multiple successful launches.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again to Bryce Durbin for creating my favorite TechCrunch illustration of all time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is not a boast, but a warning: I could write a how-to article on almost any topic.</p>
<p>Give me enough time to do some research, and I can put together a reliable step-by-step for building a custom gaming PC, installing a hot water heater or interpreting public health data. But since I&#8217;ve never actually done those things, I would encourage you to ignore any advice I have to offer.</p>
<p>Trusted advice comes from experience. That&#8217;s why Ron Miller interviewed three entrepreneurs who have each built multiple companies to uncover some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/five-product-lessons-to-learn-before-you-write-a-line-of-code/">essential truths about achieving product-market fit:</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Pouyan Salehi, CEO and co-founder, Scratchpad</li>
<li>Rami Essaid, CEO and founder,  Finmark</li>
<li>Melonee Wise, CEO and co-founder, Fetch Robotics</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic tenets presented in Ron&#8217;s story will resonate with anyone who&#8217;s launched a startup.</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm was particularly prolific this morning: For The Exchange, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">studied UiPath&#8217;s 2020 quarterly results to get a clearer picture of its first S-1/A filing</a>. Is the &#8220;somewhat slack news regarding UiPath’s potential IPO valuation&#8221; a harbinger of things to come?</p>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>ECFriday</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>In a follow-up, he recapped news from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/the-ipo-market-is-sending-us-mixed-messages/">the public debuts of Coinbase, UiPath, Zenvia, AppLovin and Grab</a>, all of which &#8220;adds up to a somewhat muddled picture of the current IPO market.&#8221; It feels like we&#8217;re in a turbulent window, but it&#8217;s also possible that we&#8217;re in the calm <em>after</em> the storm, he suggests.</p>
<p>Final note: I asked TechCrunch graphic designer/illustrator Bryce Durbin to create an image to accompany <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/">this primer on raising a Series A round</a>. He didn&#8217;t just exceed my expectations — it&#8217;s my favorite TechCrunch illustration ever. Thanks, Bryce!</p>
<p>I hope you got something out of reading Extra Crunch this week. Have a great weekend.</p>

<p>From building out Facebook’s first office in Austin to putting together most of Quora’s team, Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith has done a bit of everything when it comes to hiring.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage, she spoke about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business. As an investor, Smith has a broad view into the problems companies face as they search for the right candidates to spur organizational success.</p>
<p>She touched on a number of issues, such as who to hire and when, when to fire and how to ensure diversity from the earliest days.</p>

<p>During a seed-funding round, a founder needs to convince a venture capital investor on a vision. But during a Series A fundraise, napkin-stage ideas don’t make the cut — a founder needs product progress, numbers and revenue (or at least a plan to eventually generate some).</p>
<p>In many ways, the stakes are higher for a Series A — and Bucky Moore, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, joined TechCrunch Early Stage last week to give founders tactical advice on the process of raising one.</p>
<p>Moore spoke about storytelling over semantics, pricing and where his firm sees itself “raising the bar” for startups.</p>

<p>For a long time, “revenue” seemed to be a taboo word in the startup world. Fortunately, things have changed with the rise of SaaS and alternative funding sources such as revenue-based investing VCs.</p>
<p>Still, revenue modeling remains a challenge for founders. How do you predict earnings when you’re still figuring it out?</p>

<p>If you have a great idea within the open-core framework, expect your risks to be much lower than with a traditional business structure.</p>
<p>Clearly communicate this fact to venture capitalists for the best chance at securing the seed funding your organization needs.</p>
<p>But it takes more: Boasting a strong community around an emerging open-source product essentially serves as an “introduction letter” to venture capitalists. It highlights the founders’ ability to successfully execute their vision, as well as the mission to bring their product to a commercial reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, the iterative nature of open-source projects leads to fostering a sense of teamwork between the founders, their team and investors and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Melissa Bradley is the co-founder of a startup called Ureeka, an investor at 1863 Ventures and a professor at Georgetown’s business school. So it’s not an understatement to say that she understands the fundraising process from every angle.</p>
<p>She both invested and fundraised for her own startup during this last year, where the landscape has shifted drastically. At TechCrunch Early Stage, she led a session on how to nail your virtual pitch meeting.</p>
<p>Bradley covered how to allocate your time during the meeting, how to prepare, how to close out the meetings with a clear list of action items and what to avoid.</p>

<p>Scale CEO and co-founder Alex Wang credits its success since founding — which includes raising over $277 million and achieving breakeven status in terms of revenue — to early support from investors, including Accel’s Dan Levine.</p>
<p>Accel haș participated in four of Scale’s financing rounds, and Levine wrote one of the company’s very first checks. So on this past week’s episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke with Levine and Wang about how that first deal came together, and what their working relationship has been like in the years since.</p>

<p>For UiPath, its initial IPO price interval is a disappointment, though the company could see an upward revision in its valuation before it does sell shares and begins to trade.</p>
<p>But more to the point, the company’s private-market valuation bump followed by a quick public-market correction stands out as a counter-example to something that we’ve seen so frequently in recent months.</p>
<p>Is UiPath’s first IPO price interval another indicator that the IPO market is cooling?</p>

<p>As artificial intelligence becomes more advanced, previously cutting-edge — but generic — AI models are becoming commonplace, such as Google Cloud’s Vision AI or Amazon Rekognition.</p>
<p>While effective in some use cases, these solutions do not suit industry-specific needs right out of the box. Organizations that seek the most accurate results from their AI projects will simply have to turn to industry-specific models.</p>
<p>Any team looking to expand its AI capabilities should first apply its data and use cases to a generic model and assess the results.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into each of these approaches and how businesses can decide which one works for their distinct circumstances.</p>

<p>In the earliest stages of building a startup, it can be hard to justify focusing on anything other than creating a great product or service and meeting the needs of customers or users.</p>
<p>However, there are still a number of surefire measures that any early-stage company can and should put in place to achieve “people ops” success as they begin scaling, according to venture capital firm Atomico‘s talent partners, Caro Chayot and Dan Hynes.</p>
<p>Long story short: You need to recruit for what you need, but you also need to think about what is coming down the line.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s huge purchase of health tech AI company Nuance led the technology news cycle this week. The $19.7 billion transaction is Microsoft’s second-largest to date, only beaten by its purchase of LinkedIn some years ago.</p>
<p>For the AI space, the sale is a coup. Nuance was already a public company, but to see Microsoft offer a firm premium over its public-market value demonstrates the value that AI technology can have to wealthy companies. For startups working in the AI space, the Nuance deal is good news; the value of AI revenue was repriced by the acquisition’s announcement — and for the better.</p>

<p>When the word “hydrogen” is uttered today, the average non-insider’s mind likely gravitates toward transportation — cars, buses, maybe trains or 18-wheelers, all powered by the gas.</p>
<p>But hydrogen is, and does, a lot of things, and a better understanding of its other roles — and challenges within those roles — is necessary to its success in transportation.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is now capturing the attention of governments and private sector players, fueled by new tech, global green energy legislation and post-pandemic “green recovery” schemes.</p>

<p>Before a startup can achieve product-market fit, founders must first listen to their customers, build what they require and fashion a business plan that makes the whole enterprise worthwhile.</p>
<p>The numbers will tell the true story, but when it happens, you’ll feel it in your bones because sales will be good, customers will be happy and revenue will be growing.</p>
<p>Reaching that tipping point can be a slog, especially for first-time founders. To uncover some basic truths about building products, we spoke to three entrepreneurs who have each built more than one company.</p>

<p>In broad strokes, the United States had a crushing venture capital start to the new year, pandemic be damned.</p>
<p>That is especially true when we consider 2020’s full-year figures. Last year, venture capitalists deployed some $166 billion into U.S.-based startups across 12,546 rounds. In contrast, if the first quarter’s pace was maintained during the rest of 2021, the United States would see around 16,000 rounds worth around $280 billion.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot see the future, so those projections are merely shared to underscore how active the first quarter proved to be.</p>

<p><strong>For the past few years, our company has put very promising candidates into the annual H-1B lottery. None of them have been selected — and none of them meet the requirements for other work visas like an O-1A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We lost out again in this year’s H-1B lottery. Are there any other ways we can obtain H-1Bs for our team members?</strong></p>

<p>Few people are more knowledgeable on the topic of how founders should manage their finances than Alexa von Tobel.</p>
<p>She is a certified financial planner, started her own company in the midst of the recession (which happened to be a wildly successful personal finance startup that sold for hundreds of millions of dollars) and is now a VC who invests and advises founders.</p>
<p>At Early Stage 2021, she gave a presentation on how founders should think about managing their own wealth. Startup founders can often put all their money into their venture and end up paying more attention to the finances of their company than their own bank account.</p>
<p>Von Tobel outlined the various steps you can take to stay out of debt, build credit and accumulate wealth through investments to ensure you have financial peace of mind as you take on the most stressful venture of your life: Starting a company.</p>

<p>A few years ago, founder Sean Lane thought he’d achieved product-market fit.</p>
<p>Speaking to attendees at TechCrunch’s Early Stage virtual event, Lane said Queue, a secure digital check-in tablet for hospital waiting rooms that reduced wait times by uniting and correcting electronic medical records, was “selling like hotcakes.” But once Lane realized it would only ever address one piece of a much bigger market opportunity, he sold off the product, laid off two-thirds of the people affiliated with it and redirected the employees who were left.</p>
<p>Lane explained that what he really wanted to build is what his company — since renamed Olive — has now become, a robotic process automation (RPA) company that takes on hospital workers’ most tedious tasks so nurses and physicians can spend more time with patients.</p>

<p>In business today, many believe that consumer privacy and business results are mutually exclusive — to excel in one area is to lack in the other. Consumer privacy is seen by many in the technology industry as an area to be managed.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the companies that champion privacy will be better-positioned to win in all areas. This is especially true as the digital industry continues to undergo tectonic shifts in privacy — both in government regulation and browser updates.</p>

<p>Coinbase’s direct listing was a massive finance, startup and cryptocurrency event, and the transaction’s effects will be felt for some time in the public market, but also among the startups and capital that comprise the private market.</p>
<p>In the buildup to Coinbase’s flotation — and we’d argue especially after it released its blockbuster Q1 2021 results — there was a general expectation that the unicorn’s direct listing would provide a halo effect for other startups in the space.</p>
<p>The widely held perspective raised two questions: Will the success of Coinbase’s direct listing bolster private investment in crypto-focused startups, and will that success help other areas of financially focused startup work garner more investor attention?</p>

<p>The &#8220;billion-dollar B2B&#8221; paradigm refers to the forces shaping a new class of cloud-first, enterprise-tech behemoths with the potential to reach $1 billion in ARR — and achieve market capitalizations in excess of $50 billion or even $100 billion.</p>
<p>One of the biggest factors driving billion-dollar B2Bs is a simple but important shift in how organizations buy enterprise technology today.</p>

<p>Data is the most valuable asset for any business in 2021. If your business is online and collecting customer personal information, your business is dealing in data, which means data privacy compliance regulations will apply to everyone — no matter the company’s size.</p>
<p>Small startups might not think the world’s strictest data privacy laws — the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — apply to them, but it’s important to enact best data management practices before a legal situation arises.</p>

<p>When Dell announced it was spinning out VMware, the move itself wasn’t surprising; there had been public speculation for some time.</p>
<p>But Dell could have gone a number of ways in this deal, despite its choice to spin VMware out as a separate company with a constituent dividend instead of an outright sale.</p>
<p>It seems Dell hopes to have its cake and eat it too with this deal: It generates a large slug of cash to use for personal debt relief while securing a five-year commercial deal that should keep the two companies closely aligned.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation platform UiPath filed its first S-1/A this week, setting an initial price range for its shares. The numbers were impressive, if slightly disappointing because what UiPath indicated in terms of its potential IPO value was a lower valuation than it earned during its final private fundraising.</p>
<p>Here at The Exchange, we wondered if the somewhat slack news regarding UiPath’s potential IPO valuation was a warning to late-stage investors.</p>
<p>But in good news for UiPath shareholders, most everyone — ourselves included! — who discussed the company’s price range didn’t dig into the fact that the company first disclosed quarterly results to the same S-1/A filing that included its IPO valuation interval. And those numbers are very interesting, so much so that The Exchange is now generally expecting UiPath to target a higher price interval before it debuts.</p>
<p>But let’s dig into the company’s quarterly results to get a clearer picture of UiPath.</p>

<p>If you only stayed up to date with the Coinbase direct listing this week, you’re forgiven. It was, after all, one heck of a flotation.</p>
<p>But underneath the cryptocurrency exchange’s public debut, other IPO news that matters did happen this week. And the news adds up to a somewhat muddled picture of the current IPO market.</p>
<p>To cap off the week, let’s run through IPO news from UiPath, Coinbase, Grab, AppLovin and Zenvia. The aggregate dataset should help you form your own perspective about where today’s IPO markets really are in terms of warmth for the often unprofitable unicorns of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;ll need to prick up your ears for this slice of deepfakery emerging from the wacky world of synthesized media: A digital version of Albert Einstein &#8212; with a <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai/post/creating-einsteins-voice">synthesized voice</a> that&#8217;s been (re)created using AI voice cloning technology drawing on audio recordings of the famous scientist&#8217;s actual voice.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiWB2o-9qMs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The startup behind the &#8220;uncanny valley&#8221; audio deepfake of Einstein is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/aflorithmic-nabs-1-3m-for-ai-driven-personalized-audio-as-a-service/">Aflorithmic</a> (whose seed round we covered back in February).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the video engine powering the 3D character rending components of this &#8220;digital human&#8221; version of Einstein is the work of another synthesized media company &#8212; UneeQ &#8212; which is hosting the interactive chatbot version <a href="https://einstein.digitalhumans.com/?_ga=2.154407672.1137264718.1618594174-91366519.1618594174">on its website</a>.</p>
<p>Alforithmic says the &#8220;digital Einstein&#8221; is intended as a showcase for what will soon be possible with conversational social commerce. Which is a fancy way of saying deepfakes that make like historical figures will probably be trying to sell you pizza soon enough, as industry watchers have <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/european-union-regulating-ai-allowing-the-use-of-deepfakes/">presciently warned</a>.</p>
<p>The startup also says it sees educational potential in bringing famous, long-deceased figures to interactive &#8220;life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or, well, an artificial approximation of it &#8212; the &#8220;life&#8221; being purely virtual and Digital Einstein&#8217;s voice not being a pure tech-powered clone either; Alforithmic says it also worked with an actor to do voice modelling for the chatbot (because how else was it going to get Digital Einstein to be able to say words the real-deal would never even have dreamt of saying &#8212; like, er, &#8220;blockchain&#8221;?). So there&#8217;s a bit more than AI artifice going on here too.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the next milestone in showcasing the technology to make conversational social commerce possible,&#8221; Alforithmic&#8217;s COO Matt Lehmann told us. &#8220;There are still more than one flaws to iron out as well as tech challenges to overcome but overall we think this is a good way to show where this is moving to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai/post/creating-einsteins-voice">blog post</a> discussing how it recreated Einstein&#8217;s voice the startup writes about progress it made on one challenging element associated with the chatbot version &#8212; saying it was able to shrink the response time between turning around input text from the computational knowledge engine to its API being able to render a voiced response, down from an initial 12 seconds to less than three (which it dubs &#8220;near-real-time&#8221;). But it&#8217;s still enough of a lag to ensure the bot can&#8217;t escape from being a bit tedious.</p>

<p>Laws that protect people&#8217;s data and/or image, meanwhile, present a legal and/or ethical challenge to creating such &#8220;digital clones&#8221; of living humans &#8212; at least not without asking (and most likely paying) first.</p>
<p>Of course historical figures aren&#8217;t around to ask awkward questions about the ethics of their likeness being appropriated for selling stuff (if only the cloning technology itself, at this nascent stage). Though licensing rights may still apply &#8212; and do in fact in the case of Einstein.</p>
<p>&#8220;His rights lie with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who is a partner in this project,&#8221; says Lehmann, before &#8216;fessing up to the artist licence element of the Einstein &#8220;voice cloning&#8221; performance. &#8220;In fact, we actually didn&#8217;t clone Einstein&#8217;s voice as such but found inspiration in original recordings as well as in movies. The voice actor who helped us modelling his voice is a huge admirer himself and his performance captivated the character Einstein very well, we thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out the truth about high-tech &#8220;lies&#8221; is itself a bit of a layer cake. But with deepfakes it&#8217;s not the sophistication of the technology that matters so much as the impact the content has &#8212; and that&#8217;s always going to depend upon context. And however well (or badly) the faking is done, how people respond to what they see and hear can shift the whole narrative &#8212; from a positive story (creative/educational synthesized media) to something deeply negative (alarming, misleading deepfakes).</p>
<p>Concern about the potential for deepfakes to become a tool for disinformation is rising, too, as the tech gets more sophisticated &#8212; helping to drive moves toward regulating AI in Europe, where the two main entities responsible for &#8220;Digital Einstein&#8221; are based.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/amp/">a leaked draft</a> of an incoming legislative proposal on pan-EU rules for &#8220;high risk&#8221; applications of artificial intelligence included some sections specifically targeted at deepfakes.</p>
<p>Under the plan, lawmakers look set to propose &#8220;harmonised transparency rules&#8221; for AI systems that are designed to interact with humans and those used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content. So a future Digital Einstein chatbot (or sales pitch) is likely to need to unequivocally declare itself artificial before it starts faking it &#8212; to avoid the need for internet users to have to apply a virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0">Voight-Kampff test</a>.</p>
<p>For now, though, the erudite-sounding interactive Digital Einstein chatbot still has enough of a lag to give the game away. Its makers are also clearly labelling their creation in the hopes of selling their vision of AI-driven social commerce to other businesses.</p>
