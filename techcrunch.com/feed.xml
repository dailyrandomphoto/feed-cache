										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is back in business launching rockets, after an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/"> issue during its last launch in May</a> caused a total loss of the payloads on board. The company was quick to investigate the issue, and announced just over a week ago that it had completed that work, identified the problem and implemented corrective action to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>The launch today, which took off from the company&#8217;s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, was an important one to get right: It delivered a satellite for the U.S. Space Force to low Earth orbit. This is the second Space Force mission that Rocket Lab has provided launch services for.</p>
<p>On board the Electron launch vehicle for this mission was a demonstration satellite called &#8216;Monolith,&#8217; which is equipped with a new kind of deployable sensor that could, if it works as designed, pave the way for significantly smaller satellite buses in future spacecraft designs for things like weather and observation satellites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This turnaround after a failed launch and loss of client payload is another benefit of Rocket Lab&#8217;s ability to quickly turnaround rockets and missions. It&#8217;ll definitely be under increased scrutiny for the next little while, however, considering that this latest mishap was the second &#8216;anomaly&#8217; to result in mission failure in just under a year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/">Culture Amp</a> was founded in 2009 to let companies conduct anonymous employee surveys, but since then, its focus has expanded to helping employers turn the data they collect into action. The company announced today it has raised $100 million in Series F funding, led by returning investors Sequoia Capital India and TDM Growth Partners. The round bumps Culture Amp’s valuation to $1.5 billion, more than double what it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/employee-survey-startup-culture-amp-closes-82m-funding-round/">was after the company’s Series D in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>New investor Salesforce Ventures, along with existing backers Felicis Ventures, Blackbird Ventures, Index Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Skip Capital, Grok Ventures and Global Founders Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Culture Amp is now used by more than 4,000 organizations with a total of 25 million employees. Its clients range in size from about 20 to 30 people to more than 150,000 employees, and include Salesforce, Unilever, PwC, KIND, SoulCycle and BigCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Employee survey startup Culture Amp closes $82M round led by Sequoia China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/employee-survey-startup-culture-amp-closes-82m-funding-round/embed/#?secret=cFOcUiRECt" data-secret="cFOcUiRECt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>From its start as a survey platform, Culture Amp has grown to encompass analytics for managers, like turnover prediction and team goal tracking. It also has a sizable online community where users can connect and book workshops, including ones run by diversity, equity and inclusion experts. Culture Amp recently held a virtual version of Culture First, its annual event, with over 20,000 participants.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Didier Elzinga told TechCrunch that he sees Culture Amp’s Series F as a “validation of the HR space in general.”</p>
<p>“I think for a long time, the HR space and HR tech space have been viewed as not that interesting or important, but what we see now is that people are the most important thing that most companies have, so what can we do to craft their experiences,” he added. “I think it’s a really interesting step for the space as a whole, for an organization like Culture Amp to have made it to this level of revenue, fundraising and valuation.”</p>
<p>The company still has most of its funds from its Series E, but the new round will allow it to “work at a whole other level of scale,” Elzinga said. Culture Amp launched in Australia, and about two-thirds of its revenue comes from the United States. It is also growing in Europe, so some of its new funding will be used on its dual data centers. Elzinga added that the raise also gives Culture Amp a warchest to spend on acquisitions.</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half, employers have dealt with two major issues: a remote workforce coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and growing calls for diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Culture Amp saw more employers addressing DEI in surveys; for example, the number of companies who asked employees questions like do they &#8220;build teams that are diverse&#8221; increased about 30% in 2020. Clients have access to surveys created with behavioral psychologists, including ones designed to see if women, people of color or people who use English as a second language are feeling disengaged and, if so, how to help them.</p>
<p>To understand the pandemic&#8217;s impact, the platform introduced well-being templates, asking if employees are feeling overwhelmed, how they feel about messaging from company leaders and gauging their willingness to return to the office.</p>

<p>Surveys are answered anonymously and data is aggregated to protect the privacy of individual employees. To help companies act on the results they get, Culture Amp provides what it calls an “Inspiration Engine,” or practices that have worked for other companies.</p>
<p>Since Culture Amp works with a large group of employers, it is able to create benchmarks by industry, size and region. This allows companies to see how their employee engagement compares to others in the same space.</p>
<p>Another feature, Skills Coach, is based on behavioral science research and helps managers develop “soft skills” through two-minute interactive exercises that are delivered by Slack or email.</p>
<p>“The experience that employees have is the thing we want to up level, but the way we want to do it and what we’re focused on is lifting managers’ capability to delivery that employee experience,” Elzinga said. Skills Coach was designed to fit into busy workdays and its usage has tripled over the past year, he added.</p>
<p>“We think that for all the progress we have made, we’re still at the beginning of actually delivering on that employee experience,” he added. “I think the last two years have shown us how important mental well-being is, how important diversity and inclusion is, and how important it is for leaders to truly listen to their people and then to act on that and follow up.”</p>
<p>Other employee feedback platforms include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/linkedin-acquires-employee-engagement-and-retention-platform-glint/">Glint</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/qualtrics-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know/">Qualtrics</a>. Elzinga said the main way Culture Amp differentiates is its team of “People Scientists,” or organizational and behavioral psychologists who design surveys, work in its product team as analysts and serve as consultants for clients.</p>

<p>“We see ourselves at the point now where we have enough data that we can start to do primary research on a lot of these issues and we’re looking at how can the data we are developing help inform the space in general, not just ‘here’s what our customers are doing,’ but research that shows how this correlates to that in a situation,” said Elzinga. “The people science component is a hugely important to us.”</p>
<p>In a statement about its investment in Culture Amp, TDM Growth Partners co-founder Hamish Corlett said, “Organizations are living in a world of unprecedented change, and the last 12 months have only accelerated this. We have seen first hand the power that Culture Amp’s unrivaled data set and unique insights have inside boardrooms globally, and we expect this only to amplify in the coming years.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exo, pronounced “echo,” is commercializing its handheld ultrasound device and point-of-care workflow platform, Exo Works.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.exo.inc/">Exo</a>, pronounced “echo,” raised a fresh cash infusion of $220 million in Series C financing aimed at commercializing its handheld ultrasound device and point-of-care workflow platform, Exo Works.</p>
<p>The round was led by RA Capital Management, while BlackRock, Sands Capital, Avidity Partners, Pura Vida Investments and prior investors joined in.</p>
<p>The new funding gives the Redwood City, California-based company over $320 million in total investments since the company was founded in 2015, Exo CEO Sandeep Akkaraju told TechCrunch. This includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/exo-raised-40-million-for-its-handheld-medical-imaging-device/">$40 million investment</a> raised in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ultrasound machines can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $250,000 for low-end technology and into the millions for high-end machines. Meanwhile, Exo’s device will be around the cost of a laptop.</p>
<p>“It is clear to us that ultrasound is the future — it is nonradiating and has no harmful side effects,” Akkaraju said. “We want to take the technology and put it in the palms of physicians. We also want to bring it down to the patient level. The beauty of having this window into the body is you can immediately see things.”</p>
<p>Using a combination of artificial intelligence, medical imaging and silicon technology, the device enables users to use it in a number of real-world medical environments like evaluating cardiology patients or scanning lungs of a COVID-19 patient. It can also be used by patients at home to provide real-time insight following a surgical procedure or to monitor a certain condition.</p>
<p>Exo then adds in its Exo Works, the workflow platform, that streamlines exam review, documentation and billing in under one minute.</p>
<p>Akkaraju said the immediate focus of the company is commercializing the device, which is where most of the new funding will go. He intends to also build out its informatics platform that is being piloted across the country and to ramp up both production and its sales force.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2019/10/point-of-care-ultrasound-market-2019-deep-analysis-of-current-trends-and-future-demand-by-top-key-players-are-analogic-canon-medical-systems-usa-inc-esaote-b-braun-medical-ge-healthcare.html">global point-of-care ultrasound market</a> is expected to reach $3.1 billion by 2025 and will grow 5% annually over that period. In addition to physicians, Akkaraju is hearing from other hospital workers that they, too, want to use the ultrasound device for some of their daily tasks like finding the right vein for an IV.</p>
<p>Once the company’s device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Exo will move forward with its plan to bring the handheld ultrasound device to market.</p>
<p>Zach Scheiner, principal with RA Capital Management, said he met the Exo team in 2020 and RA made its first investment in the Series B extension later that year.</p>
<p>He was “immediately compelled” by the technology and the opportunity to scale. Scheiner also got to know Akkaraju over the months as well as saw how Exo’s technology was improving.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an expanding opportunity in healthcare technology as it improves and costs go down,” he added. “The vision Sandeep has of democratizing the ultrasound is not a vision that was possible 15 or 20 years ago. We are seeing the market in its early stage, but we also recognize the potential. Every doctor should want one to see what they were not able to see before. As technology and biology improves, we are going to see this sector grow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium enterprises have become a big opportunity in the world of B2B technology in the last several years, and today a startup that&#8217;s building tools aimed at helping them manage their teams of workers is announcing some funding that underscores the state of that market. <a href="https://joinhomebase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which provides a platform that helps SMBs manage various services related to their hourly workforces, has closed $71 million in funding, a Series C that values the company at between $500 million and $600 million, according to sources close to the startup.</p>
<p>The round has a number of big names in it that are as much a sign of how large VCs are valuing the SMB market right now, as it is of the strategic interest of the individuals who are also participating. GGV Capital is leading the round, with past backers Bain Capital Ventures, Baseline Ventures, Bedrock, Cowboy Ventures, and Khosla Ventures also participating. Individuals meanwhile include president of Focus Brands Kat Cole, Jocelyn Mangan (a board member at PapaJohns and Chownow and former COO of Snag), former CFO of payroll and benefits company Gusto Mike Dinsdale, Guild Education founder Rachel Carlson, star athletes Jrue and Lauren Holiday and alright alright alright actor and famous everyman and future political candidate Matthew McConaughey.</p>
<p>Homebase has raised $108 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of strong growth for Homebase (which is not to be confused with the UK/Irish <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home improvement chain of the same name</a>, nor the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YC-backed Vietnamese proptech startup</a>).</p>
<p>The company now has some 100,000 small businesses, with 1 million employees in total, on its platform, which use Homebase to manage all manner of activities related to workers that are paid hourly, including (most recently) payroll, as well as shift scheduling, timeclocks and timesheets, hiring and onboarding, communication, and HR compliance.</p>
<p>John Waldmann, Homebase&#8217;s founder and CEO, said the funding will go towards both continuing to bring on more customers, as well as expand the list of services offered to them, which could include more features geared to front-line and service workers, as well as features for small businesses who might also have some &#8220;desk&#8221; workers who might still work hourly.</p>
<p>The common thread, Waldmann said, is not the exact nature of those jobs, but the fact that all of them, partly because of that hourly aspect, have been largely underserved by tech up to now.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;From the beginning, our mission was to help local businesses and their teams,&#8221; he said. Part of his inspiration he said came from people he knew: a childhood friend who owned an independent, expanding restaurant chain, and was going through the challenges of managing his teams there, carrying out most of his work on paper; and his sister who<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> worked in hospitality, which didn’t look all that different from his restaurant friend&#8217;s challenges. She had to call in to see when she was working, writing her hours in a notebook to make sure she got paid accurately. </span></p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;There are a lot of tech companies focused on making work easier for folks that sit at computers or desks, but are building tools for these others,&#8221; Waldmann said. &#8220;In the world of work, the experience just looks different with technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homebase currently is focused on the North American market &#8212; there are some 5 million small businesses in the U.S. alone, and so there is a lot of opportunity there. The <a href="https://joinhomebase.com/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge pressure that many them have experienced</a> in the last 18 months of Covid-19 living, leading some to shut down altogether, has also focused the mind on how to manage and carry out work much more efficiently and in a more organized way to ensure you know where your staff is, and that your staff knows what it should be doing at all times.</p>
<p>What will be interesting is to see what kinds of services Homebase adds to its platform over time: in a way it&#8217;s a sign of how the hourly wage workers are becoming a more sophisticated and salient aspect of the workforce, with their own unique demands. Payroll, which is now live in 27 states, also comes with pay advances, opening the door to other kinds of financial services for Homebase, for example.</p>
<p class="p5">“Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, with more than 60% of Americans employed by one of our 30 million small businesses. In a post-pandemic world, technology has never been more important to businesses of all sizes, including SMBs,” said Jeff Richards, managing aartner at GGV Capital and new Homebase board member, in a statement. “The team at Homebase has worked tirelessly for years to bring technology to SMBs in a way that helps drive increased profitability, better hiring and growth. We’re thrilled to see Homebase playing such an important role in America’s small business recovery and thrilled to be part of the mission going forward.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s interesting to see McConaughey involved in this round, given that he&#8217;s most recently made a turn towards politics, with plans to run for governor of Texas in 2022. “Hard working people who work in and run restaurants and local businesses are important to all of us,&#8221; he said in a statement. “They play an important role in giving our cities a sense of livelihood, identity, and community. This is why I’ve invested in Homebase. Homebase brings small business operations into the modern age and helps folks across the country not only continue to work harder, but work smarter.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite their rich engineering talent, Blockchain entrepreneurs in the EU often struggle to find backing due to the dearth of large funds and investment expertise in the space. But a big move takes place at an EU level today, as the European Investment Fund makes a significant investment into a blockchain and digital assets venture fund.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fabric.vc/">Fabric Ventures</a>, a Luxembourg-based VC billed as backing the “Open Economy” has closed $120 million for its 2021 fund, $30 million of which is coming from the European Investment Fund (EIF). Other backers of the new fund include 33 founders, partners, and executives from Ethereum, (Transfer)Wise, PayPal, Square, Google, PayU, Ledger, Raisin, Ebury, PPRO, NEAR, Felix Capital, LocalGlobe, Earlybird, Accelerator Ventures, Aztec Protocol, Raisin, Aragon, Orchid, MySQL, Verifone, OpenOcean, Claret Capital, and more. </p>
<p>This makes it the first EIF-backed fund mandated to invest in digital assets and blockchain technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EIF Chief Executive Alain Godard said:  “We are very pleased to be partnering with Fabric Ventures to bring to the European market this fund specializing in Blockchain technologies… This partnership seeks to address the need [in Europe] and unlock financing opportunities for entrepreneurs active in the field of blockchain technologies &#8211; a field of particular strategic importance for the EU and our competitiveness on the global stage.”</p>
<p>The subtext here is that the EIF wants some exposure to these new, decentralized platforms, potentially as a bulwark against the centralized platforms coming out of the US and China.</p>
<p>And yes, while the price of Bitcoin has yo-yo’d, there is now $100 billion invested in the decentralized finance sector and $1.5 billion market in the NFT market. This technology is going nowhere.</p>
<p>Fabric hasn’t just come from nowhere, either. Various Fabric Ventures team members have been involved in Orchestream, the Honeycomb Project at Sun Microsystems, Tideway, RPX, Automic, Yoyo Wallet, and Orchid.</p>
<p>Richard Muirhead is Managing Partner, and is joined by partners Max Mersch and Anil Hansjee. Hansjee becomes General Partner after leaving PayPal’s Venture Fund, which he led for EMEA. The team has experience in token design, market infrastructure, and community governance.</p>
<p>The same team started the Firestartr fund in 2012, backing Tray.io, Verse, Railsbank, Wagestream, Bitstamp, and others.</p>
<p>Muirhead said: “It is now well acknowledged that there is a need for a web that is user-owned and, consequently, more human-centric. There are astonishing people crafting this digital fabric for the benefit of all. We are excited to support those people with our latest fund.”</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch Muirhead added: “The thing to note here is that there&#8217;s a recognition at European Commission level, that this area is one of geopolitical significance for the EU bloc. On the one hand, you have the ‘wild west’ approach of North America, and, arguably, on the other is the surveillance state of the Chinese Communist Party.”</p>
<p>He said: “The European Commission, I think, believes that there is a third way for the individual, and to use this new wave of technology for the individual. Also for businesses. So we can have networks and marketplaces of individuals sharing their data for their own benefit, and businesses in supply chains sharing data for their own mutual benefits. So that&#8217;s the driving view.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data may be the new oil, but it&#8217;s only valuable if you make good use of it. Today, a startup that has built a new kind of production analytics platform for developers, security engineers and data scientists to track and better understand how data is moving around their networks is announcing a round of funding that underscores the demand for their technology. <a href="https://coralogix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coralogix</a>, which provides stateful streaming services to engineering teams, has picked up $55 million in a Series C round of funding.</p>
<p class="p3">The round was led by Greenfield Partners, with Red Dot Capital Partners, StageOne Ventures, Eyal Ofer’s &#8211; O.G. Tech, Janvest Capital Partners, Maor ventures, and 2B Angels also participating.</p>
<p>This Series C is coming about 10 months after the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/coralogix-lands-25m-series-b-to-rethink-log-analysis-and-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $25 million</a>, and from what we understand Coralogix&#8217;s valuation is now in the range of $300 million &#8211; $400 million, a big jump for the startup, coming on the back of it growing 250% since this time last year, racking up some 2,000 paying customers, some small teams paying as little as $100/year through to large enterprises paying $1.5 million/year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Previously, Coralogix &#8212; founded in Tel Aviv and with a HQ also in San Francisoc &#8212; had also raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/coralogix-announces-10m-series-a-to-bring-more-intelligence-to-logging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">round of $10 million</a>.</p>
<p class="p6">Coralogix got its start initially as a platform aimed at quality assurance support for R&amp;D and engineering teams. The focus here is on log analytics and metrics for platform engineers, and this still forms a big part of its business today. Added to that, in recent years, Coralogix&#8217;s tools are also being applied to cloud security services, contributing to a company&#8217;s threat intelligence by providing a way to observe data for any inconsistencies that typically might point to a breach or another incident. (It integrates with Alien Vault and others for this purpose.)</p>
<p>The third area that is just picking up now and will be developed further &#8212; one of the uses of this investment, in fact &#8212; will be to develop how Coralogix is used for business intelligence. This is a particularly interesting area because it plays into how Coralogix is built, to provide analytics on data before it is indexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about high volume, but low value data,&#8221; Ariel Assaraf, Coralogix&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;Customers don’t want to store the data [or index it] but want to view it live and visualize it. We are starting to see a use case where business information and our analytics come together for sentiment analysis and other areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are dozens of strong companies providing tools these days to cover log analytics and data observability, underscoring the general growth and importance of DevOps these days. They include companies like DataDog, Sumo Logic, Splunk and more.</p>
<p>However, Assaraf believes that what sets his company apart from them is its approach: essentially it has devised a way of observing and analyzing data streams before they get indexed, giving engineers a more flexibility to query the data in different ways, and essentially glean more insights, faster. The other issue with indexing, he said, is that it impacts latency, which also has a big impact on overall costs for an organization.</p>
<p>For many of Coralogix&#8217;s competitors, turning around the nature of the business to focus not first on indexing would be akin to completely rebuilding the business, hard to do at their scale (although in fact this is what Coralogix did, when it pivoted as a small company several years ago, which is when Assaraf took on the role of CEO). One company he believes might be more of a direct rival is Confluent.</p>
<p class="p6">&#8220;I think we will see Confluent getting into observability very soon because they have the streaming capabilities,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but not the tools we have.&#8221; Another potential competitor looming on the horizon: Salesforce, and its potential move into that area, underscores the shifting sands of what is powering enterprise IT investment decisions today.</p>
<p>Salesforce already has Heroku, Slack and Tableau, three major tools developers use for tracking and working with data, Assaraf pointed out, and there were strong rumors of it trying to buy DataDog, &#8220;so we definitely see where they are going. For sure, they understand the way things are changing. All the budgets when Salesforce first started were in marketing and sales. Now you sell to IT. Salesforce understands that shift to developers, and so that is where they are going.&#8221;</p>
<p>It makes for a very interesting landscape and future for companies like Coralogix, one that investors believe the startup will continue to shape as it has up to now.</p>
<p class="p3">“The <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>dramatic shift in digital transformation is generating an explosion of data, which until now has forced enterprises to decide between cost and coverage,” said Shay Grinfeld, managing partner at Greenfield Partners. “Coralogix’s real-time streaming analytics <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>pipeline employs proprietary algorithms to break this tradeoff and generate significant cost savings. Coralogix has built a customer roster that comprises some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world. We’re thrilled to partner with Ariel and the Coralogix team on their journey to reinvent the future of data observability.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cast your mind back to that scene in Minority Report where all those autonomous cars are whizzing through the city. The more practically-minded of you may well have gone: “Yeah, but what about the insurance&#8230;?”.</p>
<p>Among the startups building the on-demand, connected insurance world for the vehicles of tomorrow right now are UK-based <a href="http://Zego.com">Zego</a> which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zegocover">raised</a> $201.7 million. Another is <a href="http://flockcover.com/">Flock</a>.</p>
<p>Emerging from an academic project to look at drones, Flock shifted into providing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/flock-raises-2-25m-for-its-on-demand-drone-insurance/">drones insurance</a> then commercial vehicle insurance. The twist is that it hooks into the telematics of cars so that the vehicle only triggers insurance cover when it’s actually moving, not when it’s sitting on the lot, incapable of causing any accidents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Flock has now raised $17 million in a Series A funding led by Social Capital, the investment vehicle run by Chamath Palihapitiya, best known as a SPAC investor and Chairman of Virgin Galactic. Flock&#8217;s existing investors Anthemis and Dig Ventures also participated. This round brings Flock&#8217;s total funding to $22 million. Justin Saslaw (Social Capital’s Fintech Partner) joins Flock’s Board of Directors as does Ross Mason (Founder of Dig Ventures &amp; MuleSoft).</p>
<p>Ed Leon Klinger, CEO of Flock said: &#8220;Transportation is changing faster than ever, but the traditional insurance industry can&#8217;t keep up! The proliferation of electric cars, new business models such as ridesharing, and the emergence of autonomous vehicles pose huge challenges that traditional insurers just aren&#8217;t equipped for.”</p>
<p>He added: “Modern fleets need an equally modern insurance company that moves as fast as they do. Commercial motor insurance is a $160Bn market, crying out for disruption. The opportunity ahead of us is enormous.”</p>
<p>In a statement Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital said: “Flock is bridging the gap between today&#8217;s insurance industry and tomorrow&#8217;s transportation realities. By using real-time data to truly understand vehicle risk, Flock is meeting the demands of our rapidly evolving, hyper-connected world. Flock has the potential to help unlock and enable a truly autonomous world, and even save lives. We&#8217;re excited to be a part of their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Klinger outlined how the company had hit a sweet spot by hooking into Telematics APIs for cars, or by doing special integrations with existing providers and OEMs: “We&#8217;ve built our own integrated approach whereby we partner with some and we build bespoke integrations with them. Often they are not as advanced as others. So we&#8217;ll either use our integration platform or or we&#8217;ll use their approach. We’re highly flexible. The core value proposition at Flock is its flexibility, so we don&#8217;t force our own integration approach.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA["You have to understand that working at a startup often feels like you’re standing on the edge of a cliff. And that’s also the moment you’re at your most creative."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is no authoritative playbook for marketing these days. Every company must find its own voice, and as it grows and evolves, its marketing needs to evolve as well.</p>
<p>Relying on proven tactics and measurable metrics isn&#8217;t enough — today, the most effective marketers constantly study and learn from innovative approaches while exploring new avenues.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.unmuted.com/">Unmuted</a> comes in. A growth marketing agency based in Amsterdam, this company focuses on LinkedIn marketing, content marketing, marketing automation and email marketing. Before starting Unmuted, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxvandeningh/">Max van den Ingh</a> was head of growth and product at MisterGreen, an electric vehicle leasing company, and he also served as head of growth marketing at ShopPop, a chat-based marketing platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Van den Ingh, who also serves as a guest lecturer at Nyenrode Business University, was recommended to TechCrunch through the TechCrunch Experts project. We’re currently on the lookout for top-tier growth marketers that you can recommend to other startups. If you know of one, let us know by filling out this <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">quick survey</a>.</p>
<p>Van den Ingh spoke with us about his “modern” approach to marketing, setting realistic goals, how startups had to shift during the pandemic and more.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>You call Unmuted a “modern” growth marketing agency. What do you do that makes your approach to marketing modern?</strong></p>
<p>The way we help our clients is fundamentally different from how most traditional marketing agencies operate. At <a href="https://www.unmuted.com/">Unmuted</a>, our clients don’t come to us to have their ideas executed; they come to us for our process. In a way, we’ve productized a growth marketing process that generates ideas for our clients. They find immense value in that process.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s team size and resources, we either guide them during execution or execute autonomously and report back. This process-based service model is, in our opinion, the only way to grow a business in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The way we help our clients is fundamentally different from how most traditional marketing agencies operate. &#8220;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a practical sense, this is what that process boils down to: We take all that we&#8217;ve learned from fast-growing companies and apply these principles to our clients’ businesses. Typically we focus on what we call &#8220;innovative companies&#8221; — whether that’s because they have a SaaS offering or they’re an innovator within a traditional industry doesn’t really matter. The process we’ve designed works for B2B startups, scaleups and SMBs. That last category can benefit greatly from the way we work.</p>
<p>Our role, then, is threefold: We come up with strategies that we carry out by experimenting with several proven marketing tactics based on our extensive in-house knowledge and experience. This relieves our clients’ marketing teams of potentially stifling tunnel vision.</p>
<p>Our growth program typically unfolds in three stages as well, which we call the Foundation, Acceleration and Transformation stages. In the Foundation stage, we set up the fundamentals based on an extensive audit of the client’s business, and start out with our initial experiments. In the Acceleration stage, we scale the experiments that have shown promising early results. Finally, in the Transformation stage, we teach our clients how to continue growing their business themselves. If necessary, we stick around in a consulting role.</p>
<p><strong>Your work at MisterGreen helped it <a href="https://maxvandeningh.com/about/">grow about 10x</a>. How much can a client expect to grow when working with you? How do you help clients set realistic goals?</strong></p>
<p>Setting goals is always a challenge, especially when it comes to marketing. Why should you aim for a certain number? Why not aim higher, or lower, for that matter? At Unmuted, when we start working with a new client, we perform a series of exercises together. This helps us get a clear picture of where the client is now and where they could be when we’ve optimized marketing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, instead of fixed numbers, like a specific amount of new customers in a given period, we focus on growth levers, like month-over-month growth in certain conversion or activation areas. Focusing on growth levers makes our work more actionable.</p>
<p>We then construct a framework as part of our growth program that also allows room for certain beliefs a company has. I feel this &#8220;belief system&#8221; is truly essential to any growth marketing strategy. If you don’t allow room for gut feeling activities and only focus on data-driven projects, you will end up only working on things you can measure. We believe that growth marketing will become more effective when you also invest time and effort in channels and spaces you can’t necessarily measure.</p>

<p>When people talk about your solution on WhatsApp or during podcast episodes, that’s amazing and will effectively influence revenue, but sometimes there’s just no way to track these activities.</p>
<p>Finally, we don’t make any guarantees when it comes to growth results. That’s not how it works. We’ll always aim to maximize results as part of the process. Diligent focus on continuous improvement and optimization comes first. Results will automatically follow afterward.</p>
<p>For instance, we recently helped a B2B SaaS platform increase demo requests by 350%. But this wasn’t the goal at all. The process we were following was focused on optimizing every aspect of the demo request journey, from acquiring visitors to optimizing the demo page and more. Every experiment we ran increased the demo request metric to some extent. After six months, you start seeing these compounded results.</p>
<p><strong>You were also the head of growth at ShopPop. How did that experience shape the way you help your clients?</strong></p>
<p>Working for a fast-growing B2B SaaS company with a self-serve product taught me quite a few things. For starters, the importance of getting a really clear understanding of what sustainable growth looks like. Especially in growth marketing, there are a lot of things you can do to gain short-term results. But this doesn’t necessarily help, because you might be acquiring customers that you lose in the long run.</p>
<p>For example, running aggressive advertising campaigns in the early stages to acquire new users in sectors that you know won’t benefit considerably from your product. This type of superficial growth will come back in the form of churn sooner rather than later, and simply isn’t sustainable.</p>
<p>At Unmuted, when we start working with a new client, we put a lot of time and effort into understanding their best type of customers, what their problems are, and why that’s the case. Only then do we start looking at how to solve those problems with our client’s products or services.</p>
<p><strong>You’re a guest lecturer at Nyenrode Business University and do speaking engagements as well. What do you hope people take away from your talks? </strong></p>
<p>When I stand in front of a crowd during a speaking engagement, I always share stories about times where I took a pragmatic approach and did things differently. Growth can come in different shapes and forms, and although it often seems simple, it’s never easy. People, and especially management, have to understand that growth takes time and that you need failures to learn.</p>
<p>You need to have conversations to be able to learn and iterate. It’s better to have the wrong type of conversations than not having any at all. Without feedback, there’s no way to grow. And while an eagerness to learn comes naturally to most marketers, this isn’t necessarily the case for your average business person. If I can inspire audiences with my approach to growing by learning, I think that’s a great takeaway.</p>
<p><strong>How have you seen startups change during the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of startups have been forced to change their approaches during the pandemic. Some have adapted successfully, while others are now stuck. I experienced it personally when I was still working at ShopPop, where we were focused on the music industry when the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>Music industry clients weren’t buying, for obvious reasons, so we had to pivot somehow. We ended up moving into e-commerce, which was, and still is, booming.</p>
<p><strong>As the pandemic continues, what trends are you seeing in growth marketing?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest trend I’m currently seeing is in the role marketing departments play. These have never been as important as they are now. Digital marketers, especially, are often the ones that come up with new ideas as to how a company can grow online. Nobody will know how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out, but in the meantime, every company is trying to adapt and find new ways to connect with their customers in unique, meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Logically, we’re seeing a surge in demand for online events like webinars and virtual summits. But everybody is doing those. So where can you carve out your own thing that becomes recognizable for your brand? Discovering these new channels and approaches — I think that should be the role of marketing.</p>
<p><strong>How have you seen the startup market develop while working in growth?</strong></p>
<p>The development of the startup market has been most noticeable in how new standards are being set. For example, startups have always been characterized as fast movers, but remote working and the rise of highly collaborative tools have further increased the speed at which startups operate. The whole industry transformed from speedboats into rocket ships. Talent became much more accessible, and through that internal cultures became more diverse and more resilient.</p>
<p>You can always depend on startups adopting new ways of working early on. They need to differentiate in order to survive, and a novel approach can be the one thing that makes them stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>You have to understand that working at a startup often feels like you’re standing on the edge of a cliff. And that’s also the moment you’re at your most creative. I think this is also how growth marketing as a whole came about. In competitive markets, people have to fight for their right to exist. Marketing is often a way to radically differentiate. When people become really good at that, set new standards and raise the bar, the market develops as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>It’s been said many times before, but even today, most startups don’t learn quickly and deeply enough. Founders often have an amazing idea and vision of how things will play out. But how much field experience does this person really have? Enough to be able to foresee the future?</p>
<p>Usually, for startups, short-term growth goes well — they get some initial traction from their network, but then the next phase kicks in. Especially when there’s an investment involved, putting more pressure on the commercial side of things, this next phase will mean encountering a lot of hurdles.</p>
<p>When a company doesn’t find a strong enough product-market fit and doesn&#8217;t apply what its learned early on, things will get extremely tough. In this phase, a lot of research and experimentation is necessary. If the founding team isn&#8217;t up for this and they put their heads in the sand, the startup will deteriorate quickly.</p>
<p><strong>On the other side: What are startups doing better now than ever before?</strong></p>
<p>The best thing a startup can do, and I’m seeing it happen more and more, is investing in community early on. When I was leading growth at MisterGreen, we created a community for the first thousand Tesla Model 3 owners in the Netherlands. Everyone wanted to be a part of this founding tribe, learn from each other, get insights and so on.</p>
<p>This group turned out to be our most effective marketing tool. Word-of-mouth went through the roof. We had all of these people talking about our community at birthday parties, in their office, you name it. This is a great example of investing in marketing you can’t really measure, but which you do strongly believe in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just half a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tokyo-based-soda-which-runs-japans-largest-sneaker-resell-platform-lands-22-million-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/">leading SODA’s Series B</a>, SoftBank Ventures Asia is raising its bet on the Tokyo-based sneaker resell platform. The early-stage venture capital arm of SoftBank Group announced today it has returned to lead <a href="https://soda-inc.jp/">SODA</a>’s Series C, which currently totals $56.4 million.</p>
<p>Other investors include South Korean sneaker reselling platform KREAM (another SoftBank Ventures Asia portfolio company), Altos Ventures and JAFCO.</p>
<p>Launched in 2018, SODA runs <a href="https://snkrdunk.com/">SNKRDUNK</a>, one of Japan’s largest sneaker reselling platforms with about 2.5 million monthly users. Along with its new funding, SODA announced it has acquired rival <a href="https://monokabu.com/">Monokabu</a>. SODA said that the deal means its share of Japan’s sneaker resale industry is now 80%, making it the market leader by far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A SoftBank Ventures Asia spokesperson told TechCrunch the fund decided to invest in SODA again because the company&#8217;s growth has increased rapidly since its previous funding. SODA&#8217;s post-money valuation is now about 24 billion JPY, or about $218 million USD.</p>
<p class="p1">Part of SODA&#8217;s Series C funding will also be used to expand into other Asian markets, starting with Indonesia and the Philippines next year because both countries have growing e-commerce markets and a large percentage of Generation Zs, an ideal combination for SNKRDUNK. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s previous funding, its $22 million Series B, was announced in January. At the time, Uchiyama told TechCrunch demand for sneakers remained high despite the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact and increased adoption of online shopping also helped drive sales.</p>
<p>SODA claims it hit record sales of $34.7 million in May 2021, growing 900% year-over-year. Despite COVID-19, many sneaker C2C marketplaces, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">StockX</a>, have also seen their sales increase.</p>
<p>SNKRDUNK will work closely with KREAM to share knowledge about sneaker authentication, inventory management, logistics and other operations-related areas, with the goal of increasing their share of the Asian sneaker resell market.</p>
<p>In addition to KREAM and SODA, SoftBank Ventures Asia is also an investor in China-based sneaker trading platform Nice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two weeks after reopening its New York and San Francisco offices, social media giant Twitter said Wednesday that it will be closing those offices &#8220;immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision came &#8220;after careful consideration of the CDC&#8217;s updated guidelines, and in light of current conditions,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter has made the decision to close our opened offices in New York and San Francisco as well as pause future office reopenings, effective immediately. We’re continuing to closely monitor local conditions and make necessary changes that prioritize the health and safety of our Tweeps,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company initially just reopened those offices on July 12. It declined to reveal headcount per office.</p>
<p>The CDC this week <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/cdc-to-reverse-indoor-mask-policy-to-recommend-them-for-fully-vaccinated-people-in-covid-hot-spots.html">recommended</a> that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in places with high Covid transmission rates amid concerns about the highly contagious Delta variant.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Brian Heater reported that Google CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/want-to-work-at-a-google-campus-youll-need-to-be-vaccinated/">Sundar Pichai announced</a> that the company will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to work on-site. It was part of a larger letter sent to Google/Alphabet staff that also noted the company will be extending its work-from-home policy through October 18, as the COVID-19 delta variant continues to sweep through the global population.</p>
<p>In a message to TechCrunch, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/facebook-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-campus/">confirmed a similar policy</a> for the social media behemoth.</p>
<p>Amazon also responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry on the matter, noting, “We strongly encourage Amazon employees and contractors to be vaccinated as soon as COVID-19 vaccines are available to them.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;I wanted to discuss this now so that you can see the future that we&#8217;re working towards and how our major initiative across the company are going to map to that,&#8221; Zuckerberg said on the call. &#8220;What is the metaverse? It&#8217;s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. You can kind of think of this as an embodied internet that you&#8217;re inside of rather than just looking at.&#8221;</p>
<p>These comments echoed an interview he gave to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">The Verge</a> last week, detailing some of the company&#8217;s future goals.</p>
<p>The metaverse offers Facebook an opportunity to draw a line between its moonshot efforts and its core business, building a wide-reaching hub that shines on augmented reality and virtual reality platforms but feels just as friendly on mobile and desktop. Zuckerberg&#8217;s definition of metaverse is more broad than some others, but comes down to building a version of the web that feels more like an MMO than a collection of web pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<div class="c-message_kit__gutter__left">
<p>It’s hard to imagine now, but Facebook was late to mobile. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A decade ago, Facebook’s apps were buggy, crash-prone HTML5 experiences, even as smooth native mobile apps were quickly becoming the standard for major software makers. By 2012, Zuckerberg realized that apps were the future — quickly becoming the present — and the Facebook founder scrambled to turn the company’s attention toward mobile at every level. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook doesn’t intend to make the same mistake twice. That philosophy first became abundantly clear when the company bought the industry-leading VR hardware maker Oculus in 2014.</span></p>
</div>
<p>“Mobile is the platform of today, and now we’re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said around the time of the two billion dollar acquisition. “Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate.”</p>
<p>Becoming &#8220;a metaverse company&#8221; is a further evolution of this thinking. For many, Roblox has seemed to be the clearest embodiment of the metaverse today &#8212;  a social world where users can jump between virtual experiences while creating their own experiences inside it. It&#8217;s notably not a virtual reality experience instead thriving largely on mobile and desktop. Roblox&#8217;s vision has resonated with investors, the now-public company is worth more than $45 billion &#8212; a fraction of Facebook&#8217;s value but more than almost any other games company in the West.</p>

<p>Facebook has been signaling its continued interest in this space. In June they bought a Roblox-like platform called Crayta for an undisclosed sum, and they&#8217;ve spent much of the last several years buying up a host of VR-focused game studios.</p>
<p>The company has tried to build its own VR-centric social hubs but most have fallen flat. Facebook&#8217;s metaverse-like Horizon platform garnered major headlines when it was announced nearly two years ago, but the company has had little to say during its exceedingly quiet beta period. This week, Facebook&#8217;s Andrew Bosworth <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/much-of-the-work-weve-been-doing-at-facebook-reality-labs-connects-deeply-to-the/10113772424752191/">detailed</a> that Gaming VP Vivek Sharma would be taking over the effort under a new metaverse-centric product group led by Instagram&#8217;s Vishal Shah.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very particular distinction in Facebook&#8217;s choice of rebranding itself as a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; company as opposed to an AR/VR one. While some might have seen specialized hardware as essential to a spatial internet, it&#8217;s become increasingly clear that users aren&#8217;t clamoring to embrace early headsets even as other new gaming platforms greatly accelerate their growth. While the company&#8217;s Quest 2 headset has sold much better than its previous devices &#8212; according to Facebook which has yet to release any hard sales numbers &#8212; it&#8217;s unclear whether they truly need a world full of users with Facebook glasses and headsets strapped to their faces in order to embrace this metaverse ideal &#8212; or whether that would just be the cherry on top.</p>

<p><a href="https://inkr.com/">INKR</a> is a digital comics platform that crosses cultural and language divides, enabling creators to reach global audiences with its proprietary localization technology. Previously bootstrapped, the company announced today that it has raised $3.1 million in pre-Series A funding led by Monk’s Hill Ventures, with participation from manga distributor TokyoPop founder and chief executive Stu Levy.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Singapore with an office in Ho Chi Minh City, INKR was founded in 2019 by Ken Luong, Khoa Nguyen and Hieu Tran. The company says that since it launched in October 2020, its monthly average users have grown 200%. It currently partners with more than 70 content creators and publishers, including FanFan, Image Comics, Kodansha USA, Kuaikan, Mr. Blue, SB Creative, TokyoPop and Toons Family, and has more than 800 titles so far, including manga, webtoons and graphic novels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Luong, INKR’s CEO, told TechCrunch that the platform will focus first on translated comics from top global publishers, but plans to open to small and indie creators in 2022.</p>
<p>At the heart of INKR’s platform is its localization technology, which the company says reduces the time spent on preparing comics for different markets from days to just hours.</p>
<p>“Comics localization is more than just translation. It is a time-consuming process with many steps involving many people—file handling, transcription, translation, typesetting, sound effects, quality control, etc,” Luong said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182962" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182962" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2182962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png" alt="A screenshot with some of the titles on digital comics platform INKR" width="450" height="974" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182962" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the titles on INKR</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to language, publishers also have to take into account the differences between comic styles around the world, including Japanese manga, Chinese manhua, Korean manhwa, American comics. For example, comics can be laid out page-by-page or use vertical scrolling. Some languages read from left to right, while others go from right to left.</p>
<p>Luong says INKR’s proprietary AI engine, called INKR Comics Vision, is able to recognize different formats and elements on a comic page, including text, dialogue, characters, facial expressions, backgrounds and panels. INKR Localize, its tool for human translators, helps them deliver accurate translations more quickly by automating tasks like text transcription, vocabulary suggestions and typesetting.</p>
<p>Since localization is performed by teams, including people in different locations, INKR provides them with browser-based collaboration software. The platform supports Japanese-English, Korean-English and Chinese-English translations, with plans to add more languages. Some publishers, like Kuaikan Manhua and Mr. Blue, have used INKR to translate thousands of comic chapters from Chinese and Korean into English.</p>
<p>INKR provides content creators with a choice of monetization models, including ad-supported, subscription fees or pay-per-chapter. Luong says the platform analyzes content to tell publishers which model will maximize their earnings, and shares a percentage of the revenue generated.</p>
<p>INKR is vying for attention with other digital comics platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/amazon-acquires-digital-comic-book-service-comixology/">Amazon-owned Comixology </a>and Webtoon, the publishing portal operated by Naver Corporation.</p>

<p>Luong said INKR’s competitive advantages include the diversity of comics it offers and the affordability of its pricing. Before launching, it also invested in data and AI-based technology for both readers and publishers. For example, users get personalized recommendation based on their reading activity, while publishers can access analytics to track title performance based on consumption trends.</p>
<p>In a statement, Monk’s Hill Ventures general partner Justin Nguyen said INKR’s “proprietary AI-driven platform is addressing pain points for creators and publishers who need to go digital and global—localizing for many languages quickly and cost-effectively while also helping them improve reach and readership through analytics and intelligent personalized feeds. We look forward to partnering with them to quench the huge demand for translated comics globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new trend is emerging in the world of startups and, to many, it couldn’t have come too soon. Why are there so few women in senior roles? Women going through menopause are commonly known to drop out of leadership roles, for instance. In the UK, menopause is responsible for about 14 million lost working days and 1 million premature career exits, according to research. Indeed, we only just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/2182193/">reported</a> on the new startup Peppy which is addressing this in employee health.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.vira.health/">Vira Health</a>, has raised a £1.5M seed funding from LocalGlobe and MMC Ventures. The round also included angel investors such as Megumi Ikeda (Hearst Ventures), Andrea Zitna of Elvie, Sofia Bendz, Matt Robinson, and Simon Lambert.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Andrea Berchowitz and Rebecca Love, Vira Health is about personalized menopause care. Its first product, Stella, is an app for menopause relief highlighting 12-week menopause treatment plans, content, and virtual events such as yoga classes or a Q&amp;A with a gynecologist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andrea Berchowitz, co-founder, Vira Health, said: “Female health issues have historically been under-researched and under-invested, and this remains the case today. There is an opportunity to use technology to redress this balance by improving the collection and use of female data in healthcare. This first round of seed funding is a step towards realizing our vision.”</p>
<p>Remus Brett, Investment Partner, LocalGlobe said: “Menopause represents a major phase of a woman’s life and the current healthcare system struggles to provide the multi-faceted and long-term support that women need.”</p>
<p>Alexia Arts, Investor, MMC Ventures, said: “At MMC Ventures, healthcare is a key area of research and investment. We see a huge potential in capturing and harnessing data insights to reshape the way that healthcare is practiced and delivered. This is particularly relevant in female healthcare where there is a well-documented gender data gap that needs to be addressed.”  </p>
<p>Prior to launching Vira Health, Berchowitz was an Associate Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, working in women’s health across the public and private sector, and led Middle East operations for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify&#8217;s recently launched live audio app and Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify Greenroom</a>, has a long road ahead of it if it wants to take on top social audio platforms like Clubhouse, Airtime, Spoon and others, not to mention those from top social networks, like Twitter and Facebook. To date, the new Greenroom app has only been downloaded a total of 141,000 times on iOS, according to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This includes downloads from its earlier iteration, Locker Room &#8212; an app Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquired</a> to make its move into live audio.</p>
<p>On Android, Google Play data <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bettylabs.disco">indicates</a> the app has been installed over 100,000 times, but Sensor Tower cannot yet confirm this figure.</p>
<p>For comparison, Clubhouse today has 30.2 million total installs, 18.7 million of which are on iOS, Sensor Tower says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other top audio apps include Airtime, with 11.4 million iOS installs, out of a total of 14.3 million (including Android); and Spoon, with 7.6 million iOS installs, out of a total of  27.3 million.</p>
<p>International apps like UAE&#8217;s Yalla and China&#8217;s Lizhi are massive, as well, with the former sporting 48.1 total installs, 3.8 million of which are on iOS. The latter has 29.5+ million total installs, but only a handful on iOS.</p>
<p>There are other newcomers that have managed to stake smaller claims in the social audio space, too, including Fishbowl (759,000 total installs), Cappuccino (497,000 installs), Riff (339,000 installs) and Sonar (154,000 installs.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183444" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183444" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="370" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png 1240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-6.37.30-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183444" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower. The firm analyzed 34 social audio apps. The chart shows those with the most installs.  </em></p></div></p>
<p>Spotify Greenroom&#8217;s launch last month, meanwhile, seems to have attracted only a small fraction of Spotify&#8217;s larger user base, which has now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/spotify-stock-dips-after-reporting-weak-total-monthly-user-growth.html">grown to 365 million monthly active users.</a></p>
<p>The majority of Greenroom&#8217;s installs &#8212; around 106,000 &#8212; took place after Greenroom&#8217;s official launch on July 16, 2021 through July 25, 2021, Sensor Tower says. Counting only its Greenroom installs, the app is ranked at No. 12 among social audio apps. It follows Tin Can, which gained 127,000 installs since launching in early March.</p>
<p>Because Greenroom took over Locker Room&#8217;s install base, some portion of Greenroom&#8217;s total iOS installs (141K) included downloads that occurred when the app was still Locker Room. But that number is fairly small. Sensor Tower estimates Locker Room saw only around 35,000 total iOS installs to date. That includes the time frame of October 26, 2020 &#8212; the month when the sports chat app <a href="https://www.axios.com/locker-room-app-sports-discussion-betty-labs-6e8a50c5-112d-41e5-9970-4b70ecb62aca.html">launched to the public</a> &#8212; up until the day before Greenroom&#8217;s debut (July 15, 2021).</p>
<p>We should also point out that downloads are not the same thing as registered users, and are far short of active users. Many people download a new app to try it, but then abandon it shortly after downloading it, or never remember to open it at all.</p>
<p>That means the number of people actively using Greenroom at this time, is likely much smaller that these figures indicate.</p>

<p>While Sensor Tower looked at competition across social audio apps on the app stores, Spotify&#8217;s competition in the live audio market won&#8217;t be limited to standalone apps, of course.</p>
<p>Other large tech platforms have more recently integrated social audio into their apps, too, including Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>), Twitter (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Spaces</a>), Discord (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Stage Channels</a>) and trading app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451481/public-app-trading-stocks-live-audio">Public</a>. A comparison with Greenroom here is not possible, as these companies would have to disclose how many of their active users are engaging with live audio, and they have not yet done so.</p>
<p>Despite what may be a slower uptake, Greenroom shouldn&#8217;t be counted out yet. The app is brand-new, and has time to catch up if all goes well. (And if the market for live audio, in general, continues to grow &#8212; even though the height of Covid lockdowns, which prompted all this live audio socializing in the first place, seems to have passed.)</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s success or failure with live audio will be particularly interesting to watch given the potential for the company to cross-promote live audio shows, events, and artist-produced content through its flagship streaming music application. What sort of programming Greenroom may later include is still unknown, however.</p>

It also launched a <a href="http://greenroomcreatorfund.byspotify.com/">Creator Fund</a> to help fuel the app with new content. </span></p>
<p>But so far, Spotify hasn&#8217;t given its users a huge incentive to visit Greenroom.</p>
<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">during its Q2 2021 earnings</a>, explained why. It said it first needed to get Greenroom stabilized for a &#8220;Spotify-sized audience,&#8221; which it why it only soft-launched the app in June. Going forward, Spotify says there will be &#8220;more tie-ins&#8221; with the main Spotify app, but didn&#8217;t offer any specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we&#8217;ll leverage our existing distribution on Spotify,&#8221; noted Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;But this feels like a great way to learn, experiment and iterate, much faster than if we had to wait for a full on integration into the main app,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite semiconductor shortages peaking during the second quarter of 2021, Ford says it delivered better-than-expected operating results by leveraging strong demand for new vehicles, like its Bronco SUV, according to its <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Ford-2Q2021-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">most recent earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>In April, Ford had expected to lose about 50% of its planned Q2 production, resulting in a profit loss for the period. However, the automaker was able to generate companywide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $1.1 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>With demand for the Mustang Mach-E, which CEO Jim Farley said is already profitable on Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, and other Ford vehicles up 7x from last year, Farley said &#8220;the business is &#8216;spring loaded&#8217; for a rebound when semiconductor supplies stabilize and more closely match demand,&#8221; according to a statement released by Ford.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company said it &#8220;has lifted its target for full-year adjusted free cash flow to between $4 billion and $5 billion, supported by expected favorable second-half working capital as vehicle production increases with anticipated improvement in availability of semiconductors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outwardly, Ford appears to be optimistic, but when pressed during the call, Farley was slightly more cautious and realistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do see the chip issue running through this year and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had discussions with the FAB suppliers. They&#8217;re telling us that they&#8217;re reallocating capital, they&#8217;re increasing supply for automotive, etc. But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the relief coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we&#8217;re out of the woods here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farley said the industry is seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but &#8220;the situation remains fluid.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not wrong. Semiconductor sales in May were up 4.1% over April, which saw sales increase 1.9% over March 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-in-may-up-26-2-year-to-year-4-1-month-to-month/">Semiconductor Industry Association</a>. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.wsts.org/76/Recent-News-Release">World Semiconductor Trade Statistics report</a> released in June forecasts global annual sales to increase 19.7% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2022. Earlier this month, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said it expects the shortage of semiconductors in the manufacturing space to be greatly reduced starting this quarter due to its increased production efforts. The company said it already increased microcontroller unit production by 30% YOY in the first half of the year and intends to bring that up to over 30% pre-pandemic 2018 levels.</p>
<p>Sounds promising, but not everyone is on the same page here.<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04858089-fbe7-44f1-b096-8e705c664f8e"> Singapore-based Flex, a global chip manufacturer, recently warned</a> that the global chip shortage would last into mid-2022, worsened by the increased demand for cars, especially electric ones, as well as pandemic-induced purchases of video game consoles, tablets, laptops and other entertaining electronics.</p>
<p>Just as Ford is trying to reduce battery supply anxiety by becoming the manufacturer via battery cell partnerships with SK Innovation, Farley said Ford is also working closely with semiconductor fabricators and suppliers to help them with future projections of how many chips it expects to need.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/why-were-in-the-midst-of-a-global-semiconductor-shortage"> big reason there&#8217;s a semiconductor shortage</a> is because automakers cut their orders when the pandemic caused a drop in sales last spring. But when Q3 2020 rolled around and demand for passenger vehicles rebounded, chipmakers were already spoken for, filling orders from customers in consumer electronics and IT.</p>
<p>In Ford&#8217;s defense, it&#8217;s not easy to predict a pandemic and how many chips one would need for that. Let&#8217;s hope this doesn&#8217;t lead to a hoarding scenario like the Great Toilet Paper Crisis of 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford and its F-150 pickup, the automaker&#8217;s best-selling vehicle, have consistently inspired brand loyalty from pickup truck owners. According to the <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-automotive-brand-loyalty-study">J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Automotive Brand Loyalty Study,</a> Ford has a 54.3% loyalty rate. Now as the automaker moves to electrify its fleet, it seems to be bringing in fresh buyers.</p>
<p>Ford released Wednesday its second quarter earnings for 2021, which besides containing a surprise profit despite the ongoing chip shortage, revealed that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning</a> electric pickup has generated 120,000 preorders since its unveiling in May. Ford reported revenue of $26.8 billion, slightly below expectations, and net income of $561 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are not orders and don&#8217;t reflect exactly how many of these vehicles Ford will sell. Customers can reserve one of these EVs by placing a refundable $100 deposit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, it does provide some insight into demand.</p>
<p>Importantly, three-quarters of those new orders come from customers that are new to Ford, according to the earnings release. During the call on Wednesday, CEO Jim Farley also said two out of five Lightning preorders are going to trade in an ICE pickup.</p>
<p>Not only does this potentially affect Ford&#8217;s sales, it also validates the company&#8217;s recent forays into battery production. Automakers across the world are engaging in battery joint ventures with cell and chemistry companies, and Ford is no different. The company has a partnership with SK Innovation to manufacture battery cells on American soil and is creating a battery R&amp;D center in Michigan, a part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion investment into electrification</a>.</p>
<p>Increased sales can also help with Ford&#8217;s expensive undertaking to invest in embedded electrical architecture upgrade that allows Ford to more easily update future EVs and enable new connected capabilities, according to Farley.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">&#8220;So</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">when</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">we</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">talk</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">about</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">upgrading</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">our</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">electric</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">vehicles,</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">it&#8217;s much</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">more</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">fundamental</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">than</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">just</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">investment</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">in</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">tooling</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">engineering</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">electric</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">vehicle</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">its</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">components</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">propulsion,&#8221; said Farley during the call.</span> &#8220;<span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">It</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">also</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">includes</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">completely</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">new</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">approach</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">an</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">embedded</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">software</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">hardware</span> <span class="transcript-snippetcontentbodyword">system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning comes with a lot of upgrades that make it attractive to Ford newcomers willing to pay more than the $40,000 base price. It&#8217;s got the same torque and power as its gas counterpart, plus a hands-free ADAS BlueCruise system, a comprehensive infotainment unit and enough battery capacity to power your whole house in the event of an outage.</p>

<p>Farley also said during the call that the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-officially-adds-maverick-a-compact-pickup-truck-to-its-lineup/">Ford Maverick</a>, a compact hybrid pickup which starts at $20,000, already has around 80,000 orders. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ford-unveils-maverick-a-compact-hybrid-pickup-truck-for-under-20000/">hybrid is marketed toward people</a> who aren&#8217;t exactly pickup truck people, but who maybe want to dip their toes into that utility pool.</p>
<p>“The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections,&#8221; said Farley. &#8220;We&#8217;re now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red-hot new battery electric vehicles&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the earnings report, the combined U.S. customer-sold retail order bank for the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/the-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-is-disappointing-in-early-test-drive/">Mustang Mach-E</a> and other Ford vehicles was seven times larger than at the same point last year. With demand increasing, Farley said the business is &#8220;spring loaded&#8221; for a rebound when semiconductor supplies stabilize.</p>

Which makes complete and utter sense. Vaccines are safe, and they keep the people around you safe. Expect to see more of this.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/search-api-startup-algolia-raises-150-million-at-2-25-billion-valuation/"><strong>Algolia raises $150M:</strong></a> The search-as-a-service company is now $150 million richer and worth a whopping $2.25 billion. The company did not share hard revenue numbers (boo), but did disclose that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew by 180% in the last year. The company last raised in 2019, when it added $110 million to its accounts at a valuation north of $500 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/duolingos-ipo-pricing-is-great-news-for-edtech-startups/"><strong>Duolingo goes public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The popular consumer edtech service priced its IPO at $102 last night, a price that we felt was pretty darn good. Now the company is worth a little more than $132 per share, which is quite the first day. Sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">edtech companies in China have taken whacking</a>, but the U.S. market seems rather lucrative at the moment. That’s good news for education startups in general.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/squire-a-barbershop-tech-platform-triples-its-valuation-again-with-tiger-global/"><strong>Squire proves that vertical SaaS can scale:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s Tiger round is Squire, a startup that provides industry-tuned software to barbershops. There are many such businesses, and thus there may be much business available for Squire to command. That appears to be the thesis behind its new $60 million round. The company’s service is “used by over 2,000 shops across three continents,” per TecCrunch reporting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/algramo-aims-to-cut-plastic-waste-with-a-reusable-container-ecosystem-and-8-5m-a-round/"><strong>This startup wants to cut single-use plastic consumption:</strong></a> In all honesty, both you and I are pretty trash for the planet. We use plastics too much, and too often just once. Algramo is out to shake that up by working with brands and providing refill stations for different products. And now it has $8.5 million in capital to keep pursuing its vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/quotapath-raises-21-3m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-help-sales-teams-better-track-commissions/"><strong>Gong.io is not the only sales tech startup doing numbers:</strong></a> QuotaPath is another, and it just put away a $21.3 million round. The startup “has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams,” per TechCrunch. Honestly this makes sense. Sales teams have tooling budgets, and salespeople like to get paid. Bread, meet butter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"><strong>Seven hundred million dollars for battery recycling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Redwood Materials, a company now worth $3.7 billion that wants to recycle scrap from battery production <em>and</em> used consumer batteries. It then takes out the useful bits and feeds those back into production. If the economics work, this rocks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/launch-vehicle-startup-isar-aerospace-lands-an-additional-75m-in-funding/"><strong>Not just a billionaire’s club:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, the Bezos and Branson rocket trips have captured lots of media attention, but building rocket-launch tech is not a thinly populated problem space. Lots of companies are working on it, including Isar Aerospace, which just closed a $75 million round. The capital comes after the company raised $91 million last December. Its new capital is an extension of that round. Isar’s rockets will be able to take up to 1,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit.</li>
<li>Remember that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">$100 million mmhmm round</a>? We got the founder of the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-mmhmm-story-and-how-it-plans-to-spend-its-100m/">on the Equity podcast for a chat</a>. Take a listen!</li>

<h2>Why I make everyone in my company be the CEO for a day</h2>
<p>In the reality TV series &#8220;Undercover Boss,&#8221; high-powered executives disguise themselves so they can work alongside everyday employees, ostensibly to learn from them.</p>
<p>Flipping that script, software company Vincit USA has a “CEO of the Day” program where staffers move into a metaphorical corner office for 24 hours and receive a very real unlimited budget. There&#8217;s just one requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees,&#8221; said Ville Houttu, Vincit&#8217;s founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Since instituting the program, Vincit USA has received multiple awards for its workplace culture and sees reduced staff turnover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it may seem crazy, the initiative has paid off tenfold,&#8221; said Houttu.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Our big technology news rundown today has two parts. The first is our usual collection of individual items. Then we have all that you need from recent earnings reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/walmart-to-sell-its-e-commerce-technologies-to-other-retailers/">Walmart is making its e-commerce tools more generally available:</a> </strong>One competitor to Amazon’s e-commerce might, Walmart, is working with Adobe to “integrate access to Walmart’s Marketplace, as well as its various online and in-store fulfillment and pickup technologies, into the Adobe Commerce Platform.” Walmart, along with Shopify and BigCommerce, are among the companies pushing back against an Amazon-only world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/snapchat-adds-my-places-feature-to-snap-map-connecting-users-to-businesses/"><strong>Snapchat adds personal spaces to its map functionality:</strong></a> Snap’s Snapchat product has been on a roll lately, driving strong revenue for its parent company. Today it announced that it is bringing something called “My Spaces” to its mapping tool. What will that do for users? TechCrunch reports that the feature will let users save their favorite locations, share them with friends and get recommendations for other places to go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"><strong>Twitter digs into e-commerce:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from today’s news that Twitter is launching a pilot of a “Shop Module” that will let folks sell stuff from their profile. Sure, Twitter is also moving into subscriptions and live audio and keeping up its streak of not building DM search, and now it will be a mix of Etsy and Amazon to boot!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, to earnings.</p>
<p>Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/shopifys-q2-results-beat-estimates-as-e-commerce-shines/">crushed earnings expectations</a> this morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">as did Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/iphone-sales-fuel-apples-wall-street-beating-q3/">Apple yesterday</a> afternoon. All of the companies were rewarded by seeing their share prices fall today. Why? It appears that public-market investors had largely priced in earnings beats to their share prices. The good news is that they are mostly retaining previously accumulated value. The bad news is that the two companies could be flashing that we’re near the peak of tech multiples.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Alphabet also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/alphabet-crushes-q2-earnings-estimates-as-google-cloud-cuts-losses-grows-54/">bested estimates and managed</a> to gain &#8212; as I write this to you &#8212; a fraction of a point in value. In other news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">Spotify’s ad business had a huge quarter,</a> notable if you are into the economics of the music and podcasting world.</p>

<p><b>Dear Sophie,</b></p>
<p><b>My startup is desperately recruiting, and we see a lot of engineering candidates on H-1Bs. They’re looking for H-1B transfers and green cards. What should we do?</b></p>
<p><b>— Baffled in the Bay Area</b></p>
<p>Dear Baffled,</p>
<p>Yes, you should absolutely sponsor international talent for green cards! Listen to my podcast in which I discuss <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/081-the-engineers-im-recruiting-want-h-1b-transfers-and-green-cards-what-do-i-do/">how to hire international professionals</a> who are already in the United States by transferring their H-1B visa and using green cards as a benefit to attract and retain them.</p>
<p>The severe shortage of tech talent currently in the U.S. is prompting professionals to negotiate better compensation packages, and companies are increasingly using green card sponsorship as a benefit to attract and retain international talent.</p>
<h2>Green card sponsorship as a benefit</h2>
<p>Companies need to offer green card sponsorship to remain competitive. In fact, <a href="https://resources.envoyglobal.com/reports/2021-immigration-trends-report">Envoy’s 2021 Immigration Trends Report</a> found that 74% of employers said they have sponsored an individual for permanent residence (a green card), which is the highest percentage in the six years Envoy has asked this question in its annual survey. Rather than waiting until the last possible moment to sponsor an H-1B visa holder for a green card, 58% of employers say they are starting the process with the employee’s first year at the company on an H-1B visa. Most employers — 96% — said that sourcing international talent is important to their company’s talent acquisition strategy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?w=680" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Sponsoring international talent for a green card is a way for companies to show they invest in and prioritize their employees and are willing to make a long-term commitment to a prospective employee. Employers can further distinguish themselves by offering to cover expenses for green card applications for a spouse and children, as well as a work permit application for a spouse.</p>
<p>Employers should also consider paying for an employee&#8217;s marriage-based green card as a third-party payor, particularly since marriage-based green cards take about one-third of the time and one-third of the investment compared to employment-based green cards. What’s more, most marriage-based green cards are not subject to annual quotas.</p>
<h2>H-1B transfers are most common right now</h2>
<p>Because most U.S. embassies and consulates abroad remain closed for routine visa processing due to COVID-19, most employers are hiring international talent who are already in the United States on an H-1B sponsored by another employer. In these situations, an employer must file for an H-1B transfer for the prospective employee. Take a look at a previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/dear-sophie/dear-sophie-how-can-we-sponsor-h-1b-transfers-and-extensions/">Dear Sophie column</a> for more details on the H-1B transfer process.</p>
<p>The questions that employers ask me most often about the H-1B transfer process include:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, Google CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/want-to-work-at-a-google-campus-youll-need-to-be-vaccinated/">Sundar Pichai announced</a> that the company will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to work on-site. It was part of a larger letter sent to Google/Alphabet staff that also noted the company will be extending its work-from-home policy through October 18, as the COVID-19 delta variant continues to sweep through the global population.</p>
<p>In a message to TechCrunch, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, confirmed a similar policy for the social media giant.</p>
<p>“As our offices reopen, we will be requiring anyone coming to work at any of our U.S. campuses to be vaccinated,” Goler writes. “How we implement this policy will depend on local conditions and regulations. We will have a process for those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons and will be evaluating our approach in other regions as the situation evolves. We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone&#8217;s health and safety.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The statement is worded similarly to the long letter penned by Pichai, which carved out an exception for “medical or other protected reasons.” The comment doesn’t offer an adjusted timeline for the return, which had initially planned to go half-capacity in September and full by October.</p>
<p>Last week, a spokesperson<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-office-is-back-what-if-covid-has-other-plans-11627099214"> told The Wall Street Journal<em>,</em></a> “Expert guidelines state that vaccines are highly effective at preventing variants of COVID-19, including the delta variant. Our timelines to reopen our offices haven’t changed.”</p>
<p>Both statements offer some wiggle room for the company, based on things like local and state regulations, medical or personal concerns and, presumably, access to the vaccine, which can vary greatly based on region.</p>
<p>Amazon also responded to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiry on the matter, noting, &#8220;We strongly encourage Amazon employees and contractors to be vaccinated as soon as COVID-19 vaccines are available to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"> company&#8217;s current guidelines</a> don&#8217;t appear to require vaccination in order to return to its offices, though unvaccinated employees are required to wear masks. Face coverings are optional for those who have verification of being fully vaccinated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook posted its second quarter earnings Wednesday, beating expectations with $29 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s biggest social media company was expected to report $27.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 50% increase from the same period in 2020. Facebook reported earnings per share of $3.61, which also bested <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/28/facebook-earnings/?sh=5ecfc92b4dbc">expectations</a>. The company&#8217;s revenue was $18.6 billion in the same quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In the first financial period to really reflect a return to quasi-economic normalcy after a very online pandemic year, Facebook met user growth expectations. At the end of March, Facebook boasted 2.85 billion monthly active users across its network of apps. At the end of its second quarter, Facebook reported 2.9 billion monthly active users, roughly what was expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s shares opened at $375 on Wednesday morning and were down to $360 in a dip following the earnings report.</p>
<p>In spite of a strong quarter, Facebook is warning of change ahead — namely impacts to its massive ad business, which generated $28.5 billion out of the company&#8217;s $29 billion this quarter. The company specifically named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">privacy-focused updates</a> to Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system as a threat to its business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a greater impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter,&#8221; the company stated its investor report outlook.</p>

<p>On the company&#8217;s investor call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed to Facebook&#8217;s plans to reduce its reliance on ad revenue, noting the company&#8217;s expanded efforts to attract and support content creators and its e-commerce plans in particular. &#8220;We want our platforms to be the best place for creators to make a living,&#8221; Zuckerberg said, adding that the company plans to monetize creator tools starting in 2023.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook&#8217;s grand aspirations for social experiences in VR. &#8220;Virtual reality will be a social platform, which is why we&#8217;re so focused on building it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>In the call, Zuckerberg also noted Facebook&#8217;s prospects for monetizing digital goods like clothing and avatars in virtual-reality-based social networks. Facebook refers to its conception of an interconnected web of virtual social networks as the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; — a corporate nod to Neal Stephenson&#8217;s 1992 futurist sci-fi novel &#8220;Snow Crash.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter what Facebook planned to report Wednesday, the company is a financial beast. Bad press and user mistrust in the West haven’t done much to hurt its bottom line and the company’s ad business is looking as dominant as ever. Short of meaningful antitrust reform in the U.S. or a surging competitor, there&#8217;s little to stand in Facebook&#8217;s way. The former might still be a long shot given partisan gridlock in Congress, even with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">White House</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/biden-jonathan-kanter-doj/">involved</a>, but Facebook is finally facing a threat from the latter.</p>
<p>For years, it&#8217;s been difficult to imagine a social media platform emerging as a proper rival to the company, given Facebook&#8217;s market dominance and nasty habit of acquiring competitors or brazenly copying their innovations, but it&#8217;s clear that TikTok is turning into just that. YouTube is huge, but the platforms matured in parallel and coexist, offering complementary experiences.</p>

<p>TikTok hit 700 million monthly active users in July 2020 and surpassed three billion global downloads earlier this month, becoming the only non-Facebook owned app to do so, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">data from Sensor Tower</a>. If the famously addictive short form video app can successfully siphon off some of the long hours that young users spend on Instagram and Facebook&#8217;s other platforms and make itself a cozy home for brands in the process, the big blue giant out of Menlo Park might finally have something to lose sleep over.</p>
