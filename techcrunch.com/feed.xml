										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just about every company is sitting on vast amounts of data, which they can use to their advantage if they can just learn how to harness it. Data is actually the fuel for machine learning models, and with the proper tools, businesses can learn to process this data and build models to help them compete in a rapidly changing marketplace, to react more quickly to shifting customer requirements and to find insights faster than any human ever possibly could.</p>
<p>Boston-based <a href="http://datarobot.com">DataRobot</a>, a late-stage startup that has built a platform to help companies navigate the machine learning model lifecycle, has been raising money by the bushel over the last several years, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/boston-based-datarobot-raises-206m-series-e-to-bring-ai-to-enterprise/">$206 million in September 2019</a> and another <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/datarobot-raises-300-million-in-new-funding-11627392058">$300 million in July</a>. DataRobot CEO Dan Wright will be joining us on a panel to discuss the role of data in business at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datarobotpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datarobotpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS on October 27th</a>.</p>
<p>The company covers the gamut of the machine learning lifecycle, including preparing data, operationalizing it and finally building APIs to make it useful for the organization as it attempts to build a soup-to-nuts platform. DataRobot&#8217;s broad platform approach has appealed to investors.</p>
<p>As we wrote at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/boston-based-datarobot-raises-206m-series-e-to-bring-ai-to-enterprise/">the $206 million round</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company has been catching the attention of these investors by offering a machine learning platform aimed at analysts, developers and data scientists to help build predictive models much more quickly than it typically takes using traditional methodologies. Once built, the company provides a way to deliver the model in the form of an API, simplifying deployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>DataRobot has raised a total of $1 billion on $6.3 billion post valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/57523-60/company/profile">PitchBook data</a>, and it&#8217;s been putting that money to work to add to its platform of services. Most recently the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/datarobot-raises-300-million-in-new-funding-11627392058">acquired Algorithmia</a>, which helps manage machine learning models.</p>
<p>As the pandemic has pushed more business online, companies are always looking for an edge, and one way to achieve that is by taking advantage of AI and machine learning. Wright will be joined on the data panel by Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO Barr Moses and AgentSync co-founder and CTO Jenn Knight to discuss the growing role of data in business operations</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Wright, the conference will also include Microsoft&#8217;s Jared Spataro, Amplitude&#8217;s Olivia Rose, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Laela Sturdy, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A judge this morning <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-epic-games/judge-in-epic-suit-says-apple-restrictions-anti-competitive-idUSKBN2G61IK">issued</a> a ruling in California’s Epic v. Apple case, siding with the Fortnite maker on the topic of third-party payments. Effectively, the judge has ruled that Apple cannot prohibit developers from adding links for alternative payments beyond Apple’s App Store-based monetization.</p>
<p>The mobile giant’s control over fees on iOS has long been a sticking point for Epic and the veritable cash cow of its in-gaming micro-transactions.</p>
<p>The ruling notes, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision is the result of a fight that&#8217;s been brewing for years between Apple and larger developers, particularly in gaming, whose businesses account for a hefty majority &#8212; 70%, the judge noted &#8212; of App Store revenue.</p>
<p>After Apple banned Epic Games&#8217; Fortnite app for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">implementation</a> of a new payment mechanism that allowed it to bypass Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase framework last August, the game maker sued Apple, alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use Apple&#8217;s payment systems. Epic Games also sued Google and joined up with other app developers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">form the Coalification for App Fairness</a>, a group that actively lobbied for app store reform, including by involving itself in individual efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/05/technology-202-state-legislatures-across-country-are-targeting-app-stores/">generate legislation</a> at the state level in the U.S.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Apple has made a few minor tweaks to its App Store rules as the result of concessions related to other lawsuits and legislation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">which included a settlement with a Japanese regulator</a> that saw the tech giant change its policies for “reader apps”&#8211; apps that provide access to purchased content &#8212; that would allow them to point users to their own website where users could sign up and manage their accounts.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/"> Another settlement gave developers permission</a> to use customer contact information collected inside their app to tell customers about other payment options. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">South Korea, a new law forced</a> Apple and Google to allow developers to use their own third-party payment systems. After the passing of that law, Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-asks-apple-to-reinstate-fortnite-in-south-korea-after-new-law/">asked</a> to reinstate Fortnite to the App Store in that market, but Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/epic-games-asks-apple-allow-fortnite-return-south-korea-2021-09-10/">rebuffed that request</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s ongoing refusal to adapt its App Store rules to the changing environment, it has historically argued, is about consumer protections. In prior statements, allowing alternative means of in-app purchases could put users at risk of fraud and undermine their privacy, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">said</a>.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s ruling will force Apple to now accommodate developers by allowing them the choice to include buttons or links to other places where they can pay, it still won in the sense that it was not deemed a monopoly. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had disagreed with how both Apple and Epic Games have framed the relevant market, saying that in digital mobile gaming transactions, Apple did not have a monopoly.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,&#8221; Rogers wrote. &#8220;Success is not illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said. &#8220;As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal.’ Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s ruling may have longer-term implications for the developer community, as Apple will have to adjust its rules to accommodate apps that point to other payment options. It could choose to require apps to include Apple&#8217;s own in-app payments option as an option, for example. It could also decide that qualifying &#8220;reader apps&#8221; as a separate category no longer makes sense, given this new requirement. But those sorts of decisions will roll out in the days ahead.</p>
<p>What Epic Games didn&#8217;t win is getting Apple dubbed a monopolist, which is ultimately a much bigger deal with ramifications that could have led to U.S. government regulations. And Apple will not have to allow third-party app stores or sideloading, which could have been far more disruptive to the long-term prospects of its App Store business as a whole. For consumers, however, it means the App Store could get more complicated as they&#8217;re forced to exit apps to make purchases or to get better pricing. And when consumers use outside payment systems, they&#8217;ll lose the ability to manage all their subscriptions in one place, potentially making cancellations more difficult.</p>
<p>As a result of the lawsuit, Rogers ruled that Epic Games will have to pay Apple the 30% of the $12 million it earned when it introduced its alternative payment system in Fortnite, which was then in breach of its legal contract with Apple.</p>
<p>Following the decision, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370846545809410?s=20">tweeted</a> that Fortnite will return to the App Store when and where it can offer in-app payment in &#8220;fair competition with Apple in-app payment,&#8221; and would pass along the savings to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to everyone who put so much time and effort into the battle over fair competition on digital platforms, and thanks especially to the court for managing a very complex case on a speedy timeline,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;We will fight on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.crowberrycapital.com">Crowberry Capital</a>, operating in Reykjavik and Copenhagen, has launched Crowberry II: a $90 million seed and early-stage fund aimed at startups in the Nordic region. A second close &#8212; bringing in an additional $40 million &#8212; is planned for July 2022.</p>
<p>The EIF (European Investment Fund) is the lead LP on the fund, after putting in €20 million from the EU’s “InnovFin Equity” program. This is InnovFin Equity’s first VC fund in Iceland.</p>
<p>Other investors include Icelandic Pension funds, several family offices and angels, including David Helgason, founder of Unity Technologies.</p>
<p>Crowberry II, which claims to be the largest VC fund operating out of Iceland, is headed up by three women founders: Hekla Arnardottir, Helga Valfells and Jenny Ruth Hrafnsdottir.</p>
<p>The Crowberry I fund (a $40 million fund launched in 2017), invested in startups in the areas of gaming, SaaS, health tech and fintech.</p>
<p>Hekla Arnardottir said: “An incorrect assumption is that because we are women, we are only interested in supporting female founders. As our investment record shows, we support companies because they are game changers, irrespective of the gender of their senior team members. However, we also benefit, as an all-female team, from a circumspection which means that we can see potential in businesses and sectors which are typically overlooked by others in our space.”</p>
<p>She added: “Inclusivity is good for business, and through being open and approachable, your deal-flow multiplies in parallel to your talent pool, and businesses are built with a broader potential user base. It’s crazy that in 2020, female-led startups received just 2.3% of VC funding, yet Crowberry considers this to be an opportunity: where the Nordics lead in gender equality on a societal level, we want to show that the region can also show the way in terms of inventive venture support.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crowberry’s previous fund (Crowberry I) featured 15 companies, of which 33% had female CEOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said on Friday it will give its two billion users the option to encrypt their chat backups to the cloud, taking a significant step to put a lid on one of the tricky ways private communication between individuals on the app can be compromised.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned service has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">end-to-end encrypted chats</a> between users for more than a decade. But users have had no option but to store their chat backup to their cloud — iCloud on iPhones and Google Drive on Android — in an unencrypted format.</p>
<p>Tapping these unencrypted WhatsApp chat backups on Google and Apple servers is one of the widely known ways law enforcement agencies across the globe have for years been able to access WhatsApp chats of suspect individuals.</p>

<p>“WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups, and getting there was a really hard technical challenge that required an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage across operating systems,” said Facebook&#8217;s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113891830147821">in a post</a> announcing the new feature.</p>
<h2>Store your own encryption keys</h2>
<p>The company said it has devised a system to enable WhatsApp users on Android and iOS to lock their chat backups with encryption keys. WhatsApp says it will offer users two ways to encrypt their cloud backups, and the feature is optional.</p>
<p>In the “coming weeks,” users on WhatsApp will see an option to generate a 64-digit encryption key to lock their chat backups in the cloud. Users can store the encryption key offline or in a password manager of their choice, or they can create a password that backs up their encryption key in a cloud-based &#8220;backup key vault&#8221; that WhatsApp has developed. The cloud-stored encryption key can&#8217;t be used without the user&#8217;s password, which isn&#8217;t known by WhatsApp.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200868" style="width: 1320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200868" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200868 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg" alt="" width="1310" height="1006" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=768,590 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200868" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp/supplied</p></div></p>
<p>“We know that some will prefer the 64-digit encryption key whereas others want something they can easily remember, so we will be including both options. Once a user sets their backup password, it is not known to us. They can reset it on their original device if they forget it,” WhatsApp said.</p>
<p>“For the 64-digit key, we will notify users multiple times when they sign up for end-to-end encrypted backups that if they lose their 64-digit key, we will not be able to restore their backup and that they should write it down. Before the setup is complete, we’ll ask users to affirm that they’ve saved their password or 64-digit encryption key.”</p>
<p>A WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch that once an encrypted backup is created, previous copies of the backup will be deleted. &#8220;This will happen automatically and there is no action that a user will need to take,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<h2>Potential regulatory pushback?</h2>
<p>The move to introduce this added layer of privacy is significant and one that could have far-reaching implications.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption remains a thorny topic of discussion as governments continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/encryption-backdoor-bill-dangerous-lofgren/">lobby for backdoors</a>. Apple was reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">pressured</a> to not add encryption to iCloud Backups after the FBI complained, and while Google has offered users the ability to encrypt their data stored in Google Drive, the company allegedly didn&#8217;t tell governments before it rolled out the feature.</p>
<p>When asked by TechCrunch whether WhatsApp, or its parent firm Facebook, had consulted with government bodies — or if it had received their support — during the development process of this feature, the company declined to discuss any such conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;People’s messages are deeply personal and as we live more of our lives online, we believe companies should enhance the security they provide their users. By releasing this feature, we are providing our users with the option to add this additional layer of security for their backups if they’d like to, and we’re excited to give our users a meaningful advancement in the safety of their personal messages,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>WhatsApp also confirmed that it will be rolling out this optional feature in every market where its app is operational. It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to withhold privacy features for legal and regulatory reasons. Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">upcoming encrypted browsing feature</a>, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-private-relay-unavailable-in-china/">won&#8217;t be made available to users in certain authoritarian regimes</a>, such as China, Belarus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.</p>
<p>At any rate, Friday&#8217;s announcement comes days after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">ProPublica reported</a> that private end-to-end encrypted conversations between two users can be read by human contractors when messages are reported by users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making backups fully encrypted is really hard and it’s particularly hard to make it reliable and simple enough for people to use. No other messaging service at this scale has done this and provided this level of security for people’s messages,&#8221; Uzma Barlaskar, product lead for privacy at WhatsApp, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been working on this problem for many years, and to build this, we had to develop an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage that can be used across the world’s largest operating systems and that took time.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a parent of teenagers, I’m used to having tough, sometimes even awkward, conversations about topics that are complex but important. Most parents will likely agree with me when I say those types of conversations never get easier, but over time, you tend to develop a roadmap of how to approach the subject, how to make sure you’re being clear and how to answer hard questions.</p>
<p>And like many parents, I quickly learned that my children have just as much to teach me as I can teach them. I’ve learned that tough conversations build trust.</p>
<p>I’ve applied this lesson about trust-building conversations to an extremely important aspect of my role as the chief legal officer at Foursquare: Conducting “The Privacy Talk.”</p>

			The discussion should convey an understanding of how the legislative and regulatory environment are going to affect product offerings, including what’s being done to get ahead of that change.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<h2>What exactly is The Privacy Talk?</h2>
<p>It’s the conversation that goes beyond the written, publicly posted privacy policy and dives deep into a customer, vendor, supplier or partner’s approach to ethics. This conversation seeks to convey and align the expectations that two companies must have at the beginning of a new engagement.</p>
<p>RFIs may ask a lot of questions about privacy compliance, information security and data ethics. But it’s no match for asking your prospective partner to hop on a Zoom to walk you through their broader approach. Unless you hear it firsthand, it can be hard to discern whether a partner is thinking strategically about privacy, if they are truly committed to data ethics and how compliance is woven into their organization’s culture.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft said in January this year that Teams, its online collaboration platform, was being used by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-education-google-chromebooks-teams-2021-1?op=1&amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 million students</a> &#8212; boosted in no small part by the COVID-19 pandemic and many schools going partly or fully remote. Now, it&#8217;s made another acquisition to continue expanding its position in the education market.</p>
<p>The company has acquired <a href="https://takelessons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TakeLessons</a>, a platform for students to connect with individual tutors in areas like music lessons, language learning, academic subjects and professional training or hobbies, and for tutors to book and organize the lessons they give, both online and in person.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but we are trying to find out. San Diego-based TakeLessons had raised at least $20 million from a <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52618-87/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of VCs and individuals</a> that included LightBank, Uncork Capital, Crosslink Capital and others. TakeLessons <a href="https://takelessons.com/microsoft-student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a short note</a> in the form of a Q&amp;A confirming the deal on its site. The note said that it will continue operating, business as usual, for the time being, with the intention of taking its platform to a wider global audience.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="exEunDIXov"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/">The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/embed/#?secret=exEunDIXov" data-secret="exEunDIXov" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how many active students and tutors TakeLessons had on its platform at the time of acquisition, but for some context, another big player in the area of online one-to-one tutoring, <a href="http://gostudent.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoStudent</a> out of Europe, raised <a href="https://takelessons.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$244 million in funding earlier this year</a> that valued it at $1.7 billion. Others in online tutoring like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/brainly-raises-80m-as-its-platform-for-crowdsourced-homework-help-balloons-to-350m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a> are also seeing valuations in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Given the relatively modest amount raised by TakeLessons, it&#8217;s likely this was a much lower valuation. Yet the acquisition is still one that gives Microsoft the infrastructure and beginnings of setting up a much more aggressive play in mass-market online education, potentially to go head-to-head with these and other big platforms.</p>
<p>TakeLessons today offers instruction in a wide variety of areas, including music lessons (which was where it had gotten its start) through to languages, academic subjects and test prep, computer skills, crafts and more. It has been around since 2006 and got its start as a platform for people to connect with tutors local to them for in-person lessons, before progressing into online lessons to complement that business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic has precipitated a shift to a much bigger wave of the latter, with online tutoring apparently the majority of what is offered on the TakeLessons platform today. These lessons continue to be offered on a one-on-one basis, but additionally students can take part in group lessons online via the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://takelessons.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live</a> platform.</p>
<p>The shift to online education that we&#8217;ve seen take hold around the world is likely why Microsoft sees a big opportunity here.</p>
<p>On the heels of many schools around the world scrambling for better online learning platforms to manage remote learning during lockdowns and quarantines, educators, families and students have been using (and paying for) a variety of different tools. Within that, Microsoft has been pushing hard to make Teams a leader in that area.</p>
<p>That was built on years of traction already in the market (and a number of other investments and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/microsoft-acquires-datasense-management-from-brightbytes-to-step-up-its-education-play-in-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisitions</a> that Microsoft has made over the years).</p>
<p>But it also comes amid a new insurgence of competition arising from the current state of affairs. That includes adoption of Google Classroom, as well as a wide variety of more targeted point solutions for specific purposes like video lessons (Zoom figures big here); apps for lesson planning and homework planning; online on-demand tutorials in specific areas like math or languages or science to bolster in-class learning experiences; and more.</p>
<p>The Microsoft way is to bring as many features into a platform as possible to make it more sticky and less likely that users will turn to other apps, providing more value for money around the Microsoft offer. In other words, I&#8217;d expect to see Microsoft do more deals and launch more features to cover all of the services that it doesn&#8217;t already provide through its educational tools.</p>
<p>(Case in point: My children&#8217;s school uses Teams for online lessons, in part because it already uses Outlook for its email system. Now, the school has announced that it will no longer be using a different third-party app for homework planning; instead, teachers will be assigning homework and managing it via Teams. For a cash-strapped state school like ours, it makes sense that it would opt out of paying for two apps when it can get the same features in just one of them. The kids are not happy about this! This is what Microsoft leverages with its platform play.)</p>
<p>NextLessons is somewhat adjacent to that school-focused education strategy. Yes, there will be a big audience of students and their families who might represent a good cross-selling opportunity for tutoring, but NextLessons represents also a more mass-market offering, open to anyone who might want to learn something, not just those already using Microsoft Education products.</p>
<p>So the interest here is likely not just students who want to supplement their online learning &#8212; there is a big audience for online tutoring &#8212; but any lifelong learner, as well as the many consumers or professionals out there who have gotten interested in learning something new, especially in the last 1.5 years of spending more time alone and/or at home.</p>
<p>And with that, there are other potential opportunities for NextLessons in the Microsoft universe.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ryan Roslansky, the CEO of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, held an online presentation about what work will look like in the future. Education &#8212; specifically professional development &#8212; figured strongly in that discussion, with the conversation coinciding with LinkedIn launching a new Learning Hub.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ODkIVeabYA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/">LinkedIn doubles down on development with new learning hub, free courses and new search fields for hybrid working</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LinkedIn doubles down on development with new learning hub, free courses and new search fields for hybrid working&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/embed/#?secret=ODkIVeabYA" data-secret="ODkIVeabYA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>LinkedIn has not only been working for years on building out its education business, but it has also long been looking for a more sticky inroad into doing more with video on its platform.</p>
<p>Something like NextLessons could, interestingly, kill those two birds with one stone. While LinkedIn&#8217;s education content up to now has not been something specifically tied to &#8220;live&#8221; online lessons, you could imagine a bridge between Microsoft&#8217;s latest acquisition and what LinkedIn might consider next, too.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>took over this week&#8217;s show with <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace, </a>which meant that our overdeveloped senses of curiosity filled up the script just fine (even on a somewhat short week). Unintentionally, today&#8217;s episode was built around a theme of inclusion &#8212; from auto-insurance to women&#8217;s health, and from payments to knowledge.</p>
<p>But here are some more specifics on what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>For our funding round section, we discussed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.’s Marshmallow getting unicorn status for its </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more inclusive, big-data take on car insurance, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/womens-health-tech-brand-elvie-tops-up-series-c-to-97m/">women’s health tech brand Elvie topping up its Series C to $97 million,</a> and an ambitious fintech play from Leap, which wants to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/"> give gig workers access to financial products</a> by partnering directly to marketplaces. </span></span></li>
<li> After getting past the dollars and deals, I indulged by bringing up my latest piece: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Edtech leans into the creator economy with cohort-based classes.</a> The core of the story gets into a ton of tensions, the biggest of which I&#8217;d pose as a question to you: should anyone be allowed to be a teacher?</li>
<li>Then we headed into Mary Ann&#8217;s world of fintech to understand what I dubbed feels like national BNPL week. If I may, I&#8217;d argue that this is the &#8220;can&#8217;t miss&#8221; segment of the entire show, as we made sense of why it&#8217;s a global phenomenon, which markets are popping off and what this means for the credit card industry. Below is a smattering of headlines we walked through:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal acquires Japan’s Paidy for $2.7B to crack the buy now, pay later market in Asia </span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip acquisition of Payflex means Africa is ripe for BNPL disruption</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi raises $75M to advance ‘buy now, pay later’ in LatAm, nearly triples valuation</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then we ended by talking about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/">an adorable, but potentially dangerous robot unicorn.</a> Yep. You read that right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember when we were all thinking about what &#8220;the new normal&#8221; would look like? Well, I guess it&#8217;s here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vouch.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of business insurance to startups and high-growth companies, announced today it has raised $90 million in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $90 million figure was raised across two rounds: a $60 million Series C co-led by SVB Capital (a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank) and Ribbit Capital that values the company at $550 million, and a previously unannounced $30 million Series B1 led by Redpoint Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, San Francisco-based Vouch has now raised a total of $160 million since its 2018 inception. Other investors include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allegis Group, Sound Ventures and SiriusPoint.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=6bp936ZVeJ" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many insurance technology companies out there that serve consumers, there are far fewer that offer it to companies, much less startups. Vouch describes itself as “a new kind of insurance platform” for startups that offers fully digital, “tailored coverage that takes minutes to activate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Vouch has seen impressive growth. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, but said it saw “7x” increase in its customer base year over year and currently protects over $5.7 billion in risk across thousands of policies. Today, Vouch has more than 1,600 clients, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/middesk/">Middesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/neighbor-raises-53m-series-b-for-self-storage-marketplace-after-5x-revenue-growth/">Neighbor</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/altman-brothers-lead-b2b-payment-startup-routables-30m-series-b/">Routable</a>. It is also the “preferred” business insurance provider to the customers of Silicon Valley Bank, Brex, Carta and WeWork. Y Combinator too also refers Vouch to its portfolio companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Vouch co-founder and CEO Sam Hodges, the ability to attract some of the highest-profile businesses in the startup world speaks to the company’s understanding of the startup ecosystem. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s our responsibility to meet startup founders where they are, and give startups flexibility as they navigate changing laws, regulations and the virtual and physical locations of their businesses,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, Vouch had to shift its model during the pandemic to adapt to the different types of emerging risks businesses have faced. For example, last year, Vouch saw a change in where its startup clients’ teams were distributed. Before the pandemic, nearly 30% of the teams were remote. During the pandemic, that figure has shifted to over 53%. As a result, Vouch developed a broader range of insurance coverages to adapt to the “new normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in its new line of proprietary products and services aimed at startups are: work from anywhere coverage, broader cyber coverages and embedded insurance. It also expanded its underwriting capabilities to serve early-stage to growth-market startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the work from anywhere coverage is in direct response to the pandemic-related shift in remote work and can insure up to $500,000 per occurrence and can include a specified property owned by a startup regardless of the location of that property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major differentiator for Vouch, said Hodges,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it is now the only business insurance provider for startups that has its own insurance carrier, which means the company backs its own policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This capability means we have a lot of control over how we build and underwrite our policies — which translates into superior coverage and a better experience for our clients,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hodges co-founded Vouch with Travis Hedge three years ago after seeing how challenging it could be for a company to get the business insurance it needs to start and then scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to make it as easy as possible to onboard new customers and personalize the coverage as much as possible based on each company’s needs based on what they do, their customer base, stage of growth and the founder’s threshold for risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical client can get a quote and bind their coverage online in under 10 minutes, without any phone calls or paperwork,” he told TechCrunch. “Vouch also has many coverage features that are uniquely geared for startups. For example, our directors and officers coverage includes a cap table coverage feature meant specifically to protect startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch looks at startups that need business insurance on a case by case basis, Hodges added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it asks questions like, “Does an e-commerce company handle a very limited amount of client-sensitive information?” If so, it could make sense that it has a lower cyber insurance coverage limit and pay less for its policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if a startup is trying to raise money, it might need to invest more in Vouch’s directors and officers insurance to make sure it is covered should disputes arise in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hodges said the new capital would go toward continued investment in technical capabilities, an expansion of its product offerings, more hiring and building embedded insurance for its partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the embedded capabilities, within the next 12 months, all of the company’s partners’ customers will be able to purchase Vouch insurance directly from those partners’ websites. Vouch’s headcount has more than doubled, from 55 employees in September 2020 to 125 full-time employees presently, and Hodges expects that will continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Becker, president and CEO of SVB Financial Group, said that Vouch’s mission aligns with SVB’s in that they both aim to “empower the innovation economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what Vouch is doing today, helping startups and tech innovators mitigate their risks as they grow,” he wrote via email. “We are proud to co-lead Vouch’s latest funding round to give startups access to the insurance they need as they add headcount, increase their customer base, or raise funding rounds of their own.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[MaxRewards is a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Anik Khan graduated from college, his first job was working on credit cards and business expenses at Accenture. There, he found that someone could bring in a couple of thousand dollars just by having the right credit cards and following the rewards and promotions.</p>
<p>It was back in 2017 when he and David Gao got the idea for his company <a href="http://maxrewards.com/">MaxRewards</a>, a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits. It also makes recommendations at the point of purchase on which card would yield the best reward for that purchase.</p>
<p>Going after the some <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2021-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2020-banking-and-credit.htm">83% of Americans that have a credit card</a>, the app version was officially launched in 2019, and now the Atlanta-based company is announcing a $3 million seed round co-led by Dundee Venture Capital and Calano Ventures. Also backing the company are Techstars, Fintech Ventures Fund, Service Provider Capital and Fleetcor president Nick Izquierdo.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/embed/#?secret=1EJaFBLKvf" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tracking his own credit cards manually prior to MaxRewards, Khan recalled in one year, getting $16,000 in rewards. However, utilizing those benefits was time-consuming and difficult, because the rewards and savings aren’t always made evident by the credit card companies.</p>
<p>“Other companies have tried to do something similar, but the issue is you don’t have the reward information or the offers,” Khan told TechCrunch. “If you were to aggregate this information, you still would have to activate all of these things and use them before they expired.”</p>
<p>Users connect their accounts and when they make a purchase, their location is cross-referenced with the merchant and an algorithm is applied to tell the user which card to use. The average app user has six credit cards.</p>
<p>MaxRewards is free to download and use, and the majority of the app&#8217;s functionalities are free. Users who want additional features, like the auto activation or rewards, can join MaxRewards Gold and are given the opportunity to choose their own monthly price — the average is over $25 per month — based on the value they expect to gain, Khan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200610" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200610" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200610" class="wp-caption-text">MaxRewards offers and benefits. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MaxRewards</p></div></p>
<p>Ron Watson, partner at Dundee, said his firm invests in seed-stage companies between the coasts and is interested in consumer and e-commerce companies. Watson said he was impressed with what MaxRewards has been able to do with a team of three. He also relates to the company’s mission, having grown up in a lower, middle-class family that did not frequently go on vacations.</p>
<p>When he got his first job and was suddenly flying everywhere, he recalls building up so many rewards to the point where he was able to go on a vacation to Hawaii and only spend maybe $100, he said.</p>
<p>“I used to put my points into a spreadsheet, but as I got older and had kids, I realized how hard it was for the average person to do that and how important it is to have automation,” Watson said. “I downloaded the app, and on the first day, saved $20.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is often compared to NerdWallet or Mint, but in terms of functionality, Khan said he feels MaxRewards is unique due to its credit card system connectors. Rather than rely on third-party aggregators to discover the rewards, MaxRewards leverages its own proprietary connectors to card systems.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of offers to be discovered, and consumers are asking for even more features, so Khan decided it was time to go after seed funding. He had raised a small seed, about $200,000, from his time at Techstars, but the new funding will enable him to add to his team of three people. He expects to be at 20 by the end of the year. Khan also wants to accelerate its user acquisition, product improvement and compliance.</p>
<p>Next up, the company is going to automate rewards and savings across additional platforms like debit cards, payment apps and cashback apps, as well as create browser extensions and a web app. Khan also wants to do more on the education side with regard to using credit cards in a smart manner.</p>
<p>Arron Solano, managing partner at Calano, met Khan through Techstars and said he is an advocate for using credit cards in the right way. His firm was looking for a company like MaxRewards.</p>
<p>“During our first call, I remember telling my partner that Anik was a bulldog who knew what he was talking about, especially at that stage,” Solano added. “He had strong team members, his vision lined up well and that checked off a massive box for us. He energized us and showed he could find a market with insanely high ‘super users.’ ”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Media technology company <a href="https://www.amagi.com/">Amagi</a> announced Friday $100 million to further develop its cloud-based SaaS technology for broadcast and connected televisions.</p>
<p>Accel, Avataar Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners joined existing investor Premji Invest in the funding round, which included buying out stakes held by Emerald Media and Mayfield Fund. Nadathur Holdings continues as an existing investor. The latest round gives Amagi total funding raised to date of $150 million, Baskar Subramanian, co-founder and CEO of Amagi, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms like The Roku Channel, Samsung TV Plus and Pluto TV. The company already supports more than 2,000 channels on its platform across over 40 countries.</p>
<p>“Video is a complex technology to manage — there are large files and a lot of computing,” Subramanian said. “What Amagi does is enable a content owner with zero technology knowledge to simplify that complex workflow and scalable infrastructure. We want to make it easy to plug in and start targeting and monetizing advertising.”</p>
<p>As a result, Amagi customers see operational cost savings on average of up to 40% compared to traditional delivery models and their ad impressions grow between five and 10 times.</p>

<p>The new funding comes at a time when the company is experiencing rapid growth. For example, Amagi grew 30 times in the United States alone over the past few years, Subramanian said. Amagi commands an audience of over 2 billion people, and the U.S. is its largest market. The company also sees growth potential in both Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, in the last year, revenue grew 136%, while new customer year over year growth was 44%, including NBCUniversal — Subramanian said the Tokyo Olympics were run on Amagi’s platform for NBC, USA Today and ABS-CBN.</p>
<p>As more of a shift happens with video content being developed for connected television experiences, which he said is a $50 billion market, the company plans to use the new funding for sales expansion, R&amp;D to invest in the company’s product pipeline and potential M&amp;A opportunities. The company has not made any acquisitions yet, Subramanian added.</p>
<p>In addition to the broadcast operations in New Delhi, Amagi also has an innovation center in Bangalore and offices in New York, Los Angeles and London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumer behavior and infrastructure needs have reached a critical mass and new companies are bringing in the next generation of media, and we are a large part of that growth,” Subramanian said. “Sports will come on quicker, while live news and events are going to be one of the biggest growth areas.”</p>
<p>Shekhar Kirani, partner at Accel, said Amagi is taking a unique approach to enterprise SaaS due to that $50 billion industry shift happening in video content, where he sees half of the spend moving to connected television platforms quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the legacy players like Viacom and NBCUniversal created their own streaming platforms, where Netflix and Amazon have also been leading, but not many SaaS companies are enabling the transition, he said.</p>
<p>When Kirani met Subramanian five years ago, Amagi was already well funded, but Kirani was excited about the platform and wanted to help the company scale. He believes the company has a long tailwind because it is saving people time and enabling new content providers to move faster to get their content distributed.</p>
<p>“Amagi is creating a new category and will grow fast,” Kirani added. “They are already growing and doubling each year with phenomenal SaaS metrics because they are helping content providers to connect to any audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ten days after Apollo Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly Verizon Media) from Verizon for $5 billion, it has appointed a new CEO for the group. Jim Lanzone, who is currently the CEO of dating app Tinder, is coming on to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210910005121/en/Jim-Lanzone-to-Join-Yahoo-as-Chief-Executive-Officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead the company</a> (which, disclaimer, also owns TechCrunch). Renate Nyborg, who had been running Tinder&#8217;s business in EMEA, is taking on the role of CEO at Tinder.</p>
<p>Guru Gowrappan, who had led the division for three years under Verizon, is stepping down and taking on a role as &#8220;advisor&#8221; to Apollo.</p>
<p>The major changing of the guard had been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored for weeks</a> leading up to the Apollo sale closing, something that our sources were saying was not inaccurate, so this should not come as a huge surprise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YtCYcxfct2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">Apollo completes its $5B acquisition of Verizon Media, now known as Yahoo</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apollo completes its $5B acquisition of Verizon Media, now known as Yahoo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/embed/#?secret=YtCYcxfct2" data-secret="YtCYcxfct2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lanzone&#8217;s tenure at Tinder was just 14 months, short-lived but perhaps in keeping with an app optimised for speed and casually meeting people? Before that, he spent years running CBS Interactive, among other roles in media, and specifically digital media, including dabbling in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-backstage-is-jim-lanzone-a-jerk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founding digital media startups</a>, such as this online video guide that launched at TechCrunch Disrupt many years ago (that company, Clicker, was acquired by CBS, which is how he came eventually to run CBS Interactive). Prior to that he worked at IAC, the company that originally incubated and launched Tinder.</p>
<p>“Jim has a remarkable track record of leading and growing innovative businesses in our industry, and we are thrilled to welcome him on board. With his experience and proven management skills, we are confident Jim is the right leader to steward Yahoo through a transformational new phase that can leverage the best of Yahoo’s platform and performance to reach new heights,” said Yahoo Chairman and Apollo Partner Reed Rayman, in a statement. “We also want to thank Guru for his significant contributions to the company, passing the baton following three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity as an advisor to Apollo.”</p>
<p>Nyborg is young but has a very long track record in tech &#8212; and another disclaimer, she&#8217;s a friend of mine &#8212; which includes time at Headspace, working at Apple across different roles in subscriptions and developer relations, building her own startups and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Her connection to Tinder is a professional and personal one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swiped right on my husband and it changed my life,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;Being CEO of this company is a truly humbling and extraordinary opportunity; to make that happen for the next generation of singles around the world. The Tinder team is – hands down – the most innovative and inspiring group I&#8217;ve ever worked with. We are building the most fun, inclusive, safest place for singles to connect. And you can see this evolution on our app. We&#8217;re building the technology and raising the bar for the industry along with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two big changes leave a lot of question marks in the air for both companies. For Yahoo, many will be wondering how and if Apollo longer-term plans to try to continue running the organization as a cohesive whole, or whether it will sell it for parts, as is sometimes the tendency with private equity houses. The appointment of Lanzone implies that there could be a bigger view to building the business into a more profitable operation as-is with a media and content face at the front of it. Or at least tighten it up to make it more attractive to other digital media conglomerates.</p>
<p>For Tinder, appointing a woman to the top job is a major move to give the app a more human face after years of controversy behind it and one of its co-founders, Whitney Wolfe-Herd, who eventually left and built Bumble &#8212; a more female-friendly dating app &#8212; to take Tinder head-on.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The uproar that arose after Dolly Parton <a href="https://timesofe.com/friday-roundup-side-hustle-collision-open-season-on-the-vaccine-and-future-of-digital-banking/">rewrote the lyrics to &#8220;9 to 5&#8221;</a> for a Squarespace Super Bowl commercial revealed a problem with the English language: A worker is no longer a worker.</p>
<p>As she sang in celebration of entrepreneurs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Working 5 to 9<br />
you’ve got passion and a vision<br />
&#8216;Cause it’s hustlin’ time<br />
a whole new way to makе a livin’<br />
Gonna change your life<br />
do something that givеs it meaning …</p></blockquote>
<p>Some criticized it, saying it celebrated an “empty promise” of capitalism, as if people aiming to establish their own businesses were “workers” who needed to be protected from powerful corporations. Others grasped that there is more nuance in our economy than ever before and that, perhaps, Parton was on to something.</p>
<p>In fact, her updated lyrics represent a shift in the primacy between capital and labor in the 40 years since she penned the original. Gone is the idea that getting ahead is only a “rich man’s game … puttin’ money in his wallet.” Workers today have a different potential than they did in 1980 when she first sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a better life<br />
And you think about it, don&#8217;t you?<br />
It&#8217;s a rich man&#8217;s game<br />
No matter what they call it,<br />
And you spend your life<br />
Puttin&#8217; money in his wallet.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are abusive corporations, and we do need a better social safety net so that people aren’t at the mercy of the doctrine of shareholder primacy, but that truth disguises a more complicated reality. The divide between capital and labor increasingly looks like an anachronism, a throwback to the language and illusory simplicity of another time. Yet still, the media persists in pushing this false dichotomy; this mistaken idea that labor and capital are two separate and oppositional forces in our economy. Perhaps doing so is human nature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or perhaps it simply sells more newspapers or generates more clicks. The media certainly thrives on conflict (real or imaginary) and, along with human nature to try to group things into black and white, the continued framing of our economy as somehow consisting of individual actors who exist solely on one side of the capital/labor line makes for easier narratives.</p>
<p>The truth of this aspect of our economy, as with most things, exists in the gray areas. In the nuance and the movement between groups. The U.S. economy has always been uniquely entrepreneurial, from the discovery of the “new land” to the formation of our government to the expansion of our country and eventually its industrialization. Entrepreneurs have long led the way. Today, nearly 60 million people are entrepreneurial in some way.</p>
<p>The vast majority inhabit the frontlines of the economy. They are freelancers or the late-night business starters that Parton sang about. They are freelancing on the side to earn money to support some other dream, or are stitching together lives for themselves by being their own boss. They’re driving Ubers, delivering meals for GrubHub and selling their crafts on Etsy. Never have more people had more access to expand their horizons through pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams than right now. And they exist in the world of technology, where a single person at a kitchen table has the same power to bring an innovation to market as giant corporations did four decades ago.</p>
<p>Victor Hwang, CEO of Right to Start and a former vice president of entrepreneurship for the Kauffman Foundation, described the capital-versus-labor debate as “the biggest false narrative out there. It’s an artificial narrative that we’ve created: employer versus employee; big versus small; corporation versus worker. All are false narratives and contribute to the incorrect notion that the most important fight in our economy exists between these supposedly oppositional forces.”</p>
<p>But our economic and government funding debates are framed, often by the media, around the idea of capitalism versus socialism, corporations versus workers. That increasingly divisive conversation has some of the hallmarks of a deliberately engineered division, like the ones over climate change or gun rights. Right-wing groups with an interest in freezing the government into inaction figured out how to divide the country into two groups and get them fighting.</p>
<p>Why don’t we have universal health care, parental leave, working infrastructure — all things that would, not incidentally, boost entrepreneurship and small business? We’ve been too busy fighting about a socialist takeover and the evils of capitalism.</p>
<p>The conflict thrives in part because we don’t have the right language to describe what’s happening now: “These debates should be viewed as part of a larger discussion,” Hwang said. “We should be striving to encourage highly innovative people and companies. What are the categories we need to develop? How do you classify someone’s role in the economy?”</p>
<p>What we need as an economy is a system that empowers more people to be producers and entrepreneurs. To solve problems and look for opportunities to create change in their communities. Instead, we’ve built a system that supports incumbents; that thrives on the status quo; that stifles innovation and uses the tactics of division to do so. It’s a tension that stems from our neoliberal worldview that achieved an almost consensus in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
<p>Beyond just arguing that free markets and open trade make it easier and better to do business (which we generally agree with), it also implied that the only thing that mattered in our economy was making big companies bigger (while, perhaps, allowing for the occasional upstart &#8212; but only those that had the potential to grow quickly and become big companies themselves). Lost was the value of smaller businesses, operating in the in-between spaces in our economy. We don’t even effectively measure their impact.</p>
<p>Wanting to know how the “economy” is doing, we look no further than the fate of the 500 largest publicly traded companies (the S&amp;P 500) or the 30 massive businesses that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average. No wonder people across Main Streets are scratching their heads as pundits describe the economy as thriving by citing the continued rise of the Dow when they can see the millions of small businesses closing all around them.</p>
<p>In our book, &#8220;<a href="https://thenewbuilders.com/"><u>The New Builders</u></a>,&#8221; we describe entrepreneurs as “builders.” Builder is a word with Old English roots in the ideas “to be, exist, grow,” according to the Online Dictionary of Etymology. In a century where change is the lingua franca, builders own the value of their own labor as a mechanism to build independence and, eventually, capital.</p>
<p>We often forget that the majority of these builders &#8212; the small business owners of America &#8212; create opportunities with the most limited resources. According to the Kauffman Foundation, 83% of businesses are formed without the help of either bank financing or venture capital. Yet small businesses are responsible for nearly 40% of U.S. GDP and nearly half of employment. Perhaps that’s why International Economy publisher David Smick termed them “the great equalizer” in his book of the same name.</p>
<p>Technology has fundamentally changed the landscape for businesses of all sizes and has the potential to enable a resurgence of our small business economy. Rather than pushing a false narrative that individuals need to choose between being a part of the labor or capital economies, we should be encouraging fluidity between the two. The more capital ownership we encourage &#8212; through savings, investment in their own businesses, and by allowing more and more people to become investors of all kinds &#8212; the more we drive wealth creation and open economic activity for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to buy things online ranging from e-commerce stores to subscription-based sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no one enjoys the hassle when you have to always re-log into different sites and stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, shopping can be a whole lot more fun if a fast logging and checkout system existed across all your favorite online stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., high-flying startup Fast already caters to this need. Although the company is building a global product, it is limited in Africa, and <a href="https://www.ourpass.co/">OurPass</a> has taken an interest to build one for the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nigeria-based startup, which describes itself as the &#8220;Fast for Africa&#8221;, has also closed a $1 million pre-seed round to scale across the country. The round was led by Tekedia Capital and angel investors from Fortune 500 companies, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce checkout problem is one founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-chukwunonso-eze-4279a1107">Samuel Eze</a> is familiar with, but through a second-hand experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I watched my mother struggle to shop online where I saw her set up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounts on different platforms while going through a rigorous checkout process,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she ended up dropping the card and moving on to a different online store. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the same pattern happen with other friends and family, I had to dive into it and found that it was actually a major headache for consumers and online retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s e-commerce market is still </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reliant on cash on delivery. In fact, as of 2019, 70% of Nigerians <a href="https://techeconomy.ng/2018/03/ecommerce-report-shows-70-of-nigerians-prefer-cash-on-delivery/">in a survey</a> said they prefer cash on delivery options to making online payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the narrative is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slowly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing with the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave, making it easier for merchants to collect online payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1172940/distribution-of-online-payment-methods-in-nigeria/">Statista</a>, 27% of online payments made on e-commerce sites a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re now carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out with cards, topping cash and bank transfers as the most common payment method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heckout still remains a major issue for merchants. Yearly, about 75% of shopping carts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are abandoned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to how cumbersome the checkout experience can be with long forms and re-log ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempting to tackle this challenge, OurPass provides a mobile application that enables consumers to shop with one click. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time consumers sign up on the OurPass platform, they enter their names, email and shipping addresses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OurPass then creates an identity for each customer, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is passed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across every online store they shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We built an identity layer across the web to enable consumer identity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be sent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across to every single online store they go to check out from,&#8221; said Eze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, OurPass customers would not need to fill out any form anymore and do not have to deal with re-logging issues. But here&#8217;s the thing: they can only shop with merchants that have OurPass API linked to their platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s a big ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why has OurPass decided to go this route of creating its own ecosystem of merchants and consumers? For instance, in Fast&#8217;s case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only the merchants need to install Fast Checkout, while users can access the service via an e-commerce or merchant&#8217;s website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for OurPass, users need to download an application and shop with merchants using the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OurPass allowed users to fill in their payment card details when completing their forms for the first time without the need to download an application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after several instances of payment gateways flagging many cards used by OurPass consumers and failed card transactions, the company chose to adopt a wallet strategy and created an application for consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We did not want to defeat our USP of one-click checkout by allowing consumers to try to check out in one-click only for them to see their cards flagged as fraudulent,&#8221; Eze said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Hence the reason why we had to build our system on a wallet system to enable that one-click checkout.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means consumers and merchants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are assigned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtual account numbers to be used in a wallet. For consumers to check out from a store, they&#8217;ll need to fund their wallets, and once they check out, the money moves into the merchants&#8217; wallets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eze says this helps OurPass capture value end to end and offers instant settlement of payments which, according to him, was not the case with payment gateways</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OurPass has gathered a few merchants on its platform. Most of its clients are small businesses that use <a href="http://storemia.ourpass.co/">Storemia</a>, an online storefront provider OurPass acquired recently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to work with merchants on e-commerce platforms, including WooCommerce, Magento, Squarespace and Shopify in the future and social commerce platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside its one-click checkout, OurPass also offers free delivery on all orders for customers. The company partnered with logistics companies like MAX.ng and Gokada to execute on this front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year-old company charges 0.8% per transaction, capped at N1,000 (~$2) for merchants and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commission of 5% on every product sold — Eze also hints at a plan for the company to introduce subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since beta launching in May this year, OurPass claims to have done $500,000 in transaction value and hopes continuous growth will see it become the go-to platform for consumer checkout in Nigeria by 2023</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per use of funds, Eze says OurPass will develop its technology and grow its team to up to 200 people before the end of next year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Music announced today that it&#8217;s created a process to properly identify and compensate all of the individual creators involved in making a DJ mix. Using technology from the audio-recognition app Shazam, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">Apple acquired in 2018 for $400 million</a>, Apple Music is working with major and independent labels to devise a fair way to divide streaming royalties among DJs, labels and artists who appear in the mixes. This is intended to help DJ mixes retain long-term monetary value for all creators involved, making sure that musicians get paid for their work even when other artists iterate on it. And, as one of Apple&#8217;s first major integrations of Shazam&#8217;s technology, it appears that the company saw value in it.</p>
<p>Historically, it&#8217;s been difficult for DJs to stream mixes online, since livestreaming platforms like YouTube or Twitch might flag the use of other artists&#8217; songs as copyright infringement. Artists are entitled to royalties when their song is played by a DJ during a live set, but dance music further complicates this, since small samples from various songs can be edited and mixed together into something unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Apple Music already hosts <a href="https://music.apple.com/curator/apple-music-dj-mixes-live-sets/1441811365">thousands of mixes</a>, including sets from Tomorrowland&#8217;s digital festivals from 2020 and 2021, but only now is it formally announcing the tech that enables it to do this, even though <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9581667/apple-music-clearing-dj-sets-twitch-track/">Billboard noted it in June</a>. As part of this announcement, Studio K7!&#8217;s DJ Kicks archive of mixes will begin to roll out on the service, giving fans access to mixes that haven&#8217;t been on the market in over 15 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Music is the first platform that offers continuous mixes where there’s a fair fee involved for the artists whose tracks are included in the mixes and for the artist making those mixes. It’s a step in the right direction where everyone gets treated fairly,&#8221; DJ Charlotte de Witte said in a statement on behalf of Apple. &#8220;I’m beyond excited to have the chance to provide online mixes again.&#8221;</p>

<p>For dance music fans, the ability to stream DJ mixes is groundbreaking, and it can help Apple Music compete with Spotify, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">leads the industry</a> in paid subscribers as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">surpasses Apple&#8217;s hold on podcasting</a>. Even as Apple Music has introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">lossless audio, spatial audio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">classical music</a> acquisitions, the company hasn&#8217;t yet outpaced Spotify, though the addition of DJ mixes adds yet another unique music feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, Apple Music&#8217;s dive into the DJ royalties conundrum doesn&#8217;t necessarily address the broader crises at play among live musicians and DJs surviving through a pandemic.</p>
<p>Though platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/mixcloud-select/">Mixcloud</a> allow DJs to stream sets and monetize using pre-licensed music, Apple Music&#8217;s DJ mixes will not include user-generated content. MIDiA Research, in partnership with Audible Magic, found that user-generated content (UGC) &#8212; online content that uses music, whether it&#8217;s a lipsync TikTok or a Soundcloud DJ mix &#8212; could be a music industry goldmine worth <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/ugc-is-the-next-music-industry-growth-driver-and-the-short-term-opportunity-is-worth-6-billion">over $6 billion</a> in the next two years. But Apple is not yet investing in UGC, as individuals cannot yet upload their personal mixes to stream on the platform like they might on Soundcloud. According to a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9581667/apple-music-clearing-dj-sets-twitch-track/">Billboard report</a> from June, Apple Music will only host mixes after the streamer has identified 70% of the combined tracks.</p>
<p>Apple Music didn&#8217;t respond to questions about how exactly royalties will be divided, but this is only a small step in reimagining how musicians will make a living in a digital landscape.</p>
<p>While these innovations help get artists compensated, streaming royalties only account for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-musicians-make-money-2018-10">small percentage</a> of how musicians make money &#8212; Apple pays musicians <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800">one cent per stream</a>, while competitors like Spotify pay only fractions of cents. This led the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">a campaign</a> in March called <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">Justice at Spotify</a>, which demands a one-cent-per-stream payout that matches Apple&#8217;s. But live events remain a musician&#8217;s bread and butter, especially given platforms&#8217; paltry streaming payouts &#8212; of course, the pandemic hasn&#8217;t been conducive to touring. To add insult to injury, the Association for Electronic Music estimated in 2016 that dance music producers missed out on <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9332838/music-recognition-technology-royalties-dj-producers-2020-dance-issue/">$120 million in royalties</a> from their work being used without attribution in live performances.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games has asked Apple to rejoin its Fortnite developer account in South Korea as the U.S. game maker plans to re-release Fortnite on iOS in South Korea, offering both Epic and Apple payments side-by-side, it <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832">said in a tweet.</a></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Epic has asked Apple to restore our Fortnite developer account. Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.</p>
<p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This request comes after South Korea passed a bill, the updated Telecommunications Business Act, in late August that will force Apple and other tech giants to let developers use their third-party payment systems.</p>
<p>“Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korea law,” according to the official Fortnite Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else. Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account,&#8221; Apple said in its statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Epic would also have to agree to comply with Apple&#8217;s App Store Review Guidelines regarding all apps, but Epic has not consistently abided by the Guidelines, and their request of Apple does not indicate any change in Epic&#8217;s position, added Apple&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>Even if the South Korean legislation, which is not yet effective, were to become law in the country, it would impose no obligation on Apple to approve any developer program account application, based on Apple&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Apple kicked Fortnite off the App Store after Epic introduced a direct payment system in Fortnite that violated Apple’s in-app purchase requirement. The two companies have been embroiled in a legal dispute over the Apple Store’s payment system.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">Apple is changing its app policy to allow developers to link to external websites</a> and it also has reached a settlement with Japan for allowing developers of “reader” apps to link to their own websites.</p>
<p>An Epic Games spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food ordering and delivery platforms DoorDash, Caviar, Grubhub, Seamless, Postmates and Uber Eats have banded together to sue the City of New York over a law that would permanently limit the amount of commissions the apps can charge restaurants to use their services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-doordash-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-over-fee-caps-11631237227">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported the news that the companies filed suit in federal court on Thursday evening and are seeking an injunction that would prevent the city from enforcing the legislation, unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.</p>
<p>Last year, the city council introduced temporary legislation that would prohibit third-party food delivery services from charging restaurants more than 15% per delivery order and more than 5% for marketing and other nondelivery fees in an effort to help ease the strain on an industry struggling from pandemic lockdowns. The companies filing suit against the city claim the limit on fees, which was made permanent last month under <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/permanent-cap-on-delivery-app-fees-proposed-for-new-york-city-11624549165?mod=article_inline">a bill sponsored in June by Queens Councilman Francisco Moya</a>, has already cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Google&#8217;s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=cVg1rLPjE2" data-secret="cVg1rLPjE2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, third-party platforms like Plaintiffs have been instrumental in keeping restaurants afloat and food industry workers employed, including by investing millions of dollars in COVID-relief efforts specifically for local restaurants,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. &#8220;Yet, the City of New York has taken the extraordinary measure of imposing permanent price controls on a private and highly competitive industry—the facilitation of food ordering and delivery through third-party platforms. Those permanent price controls will harm not only Plaintiffs, but also the revitalization of the very local restaurants that the City claims to serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other cities also instituted similar caps during the pandemic, but most have fizzled out as the pandemic has eased and restaurants have been able to open their dining rooms. San Francisco is among of handful of cities that has also decided to enact a permanent 15% cap, and the app-based companies are suing there, as well. They argue that extending the limits on fees, which can be as high as 30% per order, &#8220;bears no relationship to any public-health emergency,&#8221; and are unconstitutional because they interfere with negotiated contracts and dictate &#8220;the economic terms on which a dynamic industry operates.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with the temporary law, any violators of the permanent cap would face up to $1,000 per day in fines per restaurant. The companies said the new law would not only cause them to have to rewrite their contracts with restaurants, but also raise fees for consumers and hurt delivery workers&#8217; ability to make money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The companies also argue that if the city wants to improve profitability of local restaurants, it could provide tax breaks or grants out of its own pocket instead of hurting the commissions of the delivery services.</p>
<p>&#8220;But rather than exercise one of those lawful options, the City chose instead to adopt an irrational law, driven by naked animosity towards third-party platforms,&#8221; the companies said, citing a tweet from Moya after he introduced a 10% commission cap bill that said, &#8220;NYC local restaurants needed a 10 percent cap on delivery fees from third party services like GrubHub long before #COVID19 hit us. They damn sure need it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This legislation also comes amid increasing scrutiny over app-based delivery companies that have a reputation for harming both restaurants and gig workers in an effort to keep costs low for consumers. Recently, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">California superior court ruled Proposition 22</a>, which would allow these companies to continue classifying its workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, as unconstitutional. This ruling prompted DoorDash workers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">protest last week outside the home of CEO Tony Xu</a> demanding better pay and more tip transparency. Meanwhile in Massachusetts, a similar law to Prop 22 has just gotten the green light to go ahead on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">November 2022 ballot</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Restaurants pay app-based delivery companies for a variety of services through commissions, one of these being delivery services,&#8221; said an unnamed courier in the lawsuit against the city. &#8220;Capping these commissions means less earnings for people like me. A commission cap could also mean delivery services get more expensive for the customers I deliver to, which ultimately means less orders for me.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://snyk.io">Snyk</a>, the Boston-based late-stage startup that is trying to help developers deliver more secure code, announced another mega-round today. This one was for $530 million on an $8.5 billion valuation, with $300 million in new money and $230 million in secondary funding, the latter of which is to help employees and early investors cash in some of their stock options. The $8.5 billion valuation was up from $4.7 billion in March when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/snyk-raises-300-million-at-a-4-7-billion-valuation-as-employees-cash-in-and-the-security-company-beefs-up/">the company raised $300 million</a>.</p>
<p>The long list of investors includes an interesting mix of public investors, VC firms and strategics. Sands Capital and Tiger Global led the round, with participation from new investors Baillie Gifford, Koch Strategic Platforms, Lone Pine Capital, T. Rowe Price and Whale Rock Capital Management. Existing investors also came along for the ride, including Accel, Addition, Alkeon, Atlassian Ventures, BlackRock, Boldstart Ventures, Canaan Partners, Coatue, Franklin Templeton, Geodesic Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Temasek.</p>
<p>This round brings the total raised in funding to $775 million, excluding secondary rounds, according to the company. With secondary rounds, it&#8217;s up to $1.3 billion, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snyk">data</a>. The company has been raising funds at a rapid clip (note that the last three rounds include the Snyk money plus secondary rounds):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2200722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Snyk's last four rounds" width="680" height="176" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,39 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,78 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,199 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,176 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>While the company wouldn&#8217;t share specific revenue figures, it did say that ARR has grown 158% YoY; given the confidence of this list of investors and the valuation, it would suggest the company is making decent money.</p>
<p>Snyk CEO Peter McKay says that the additional money gives him flexibility to make some acquisitions if the right opportunity comes along, what companies often refer to as &#8220;inorganic&#8221; growth. &#8220;We do believe that a portion of this money will be for inorganic expansion. We&#8217;ve made three acquisitions at this point and all three have been very, very successful for us. So it&#8217;s definitely a muscle that we&#8217;ve been developing,&#8221; McKay told me.</p>
<p>The company started this year with 400 people and McKay says they expect to double that number by the end of this year. He says that when it comes to diversity, the work is never really done, but it&#8217;s something he is working hard at.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to build a lot of good programs around the world to increase that diversity and our culture has always been inclusive by nature because we&#8217;re highly distributed.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I&#8217;m not by any means saying we&#8217;re even remotely close to where we want to be. So I want to make that clear. There&#8217;s a lot we still have to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McKay says that today&#8217;s investment gives him added flexibility to decide when to take the company public because whenever that happens it won&#8217;t have to be because they need another fundraising event. &#8220;This raise has allowed us to set up with strong, highly reputable public investors, and it gives us the financial resources to pick the timing. We are in control of when we do it and we will do it when it&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has reportedly appointed a new executive to lead the development of its secretive self-driving car division. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has tapped Kevin Lynch to oversee Project Titan following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hires-doug-field-204511159.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><ins>departure of executive Doug Field</ins></a>, who left the iPhone maker for Ford earlier this week.</p>
<p>The name may not be familiar, but if you’ve watched any Apple event in recent years, you’ve seen Lynch on stage. After a stint at Adobe, he joined Apple in 2013 to oversee the company’s wearable and health unit and has frequently been the one to present whatever new features Apple is working on for watchOS.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports Lynch joined the division earlier in the year but is now overseeing the entire unit. The outlet notes Lynch’s appointment suggests Apple is likely focusing on underlying software that a self-driving car would need to navigate the road, instead of a vehicle that we could see the company release anytime soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/grg">Greg</a> here again for this edition of the Daily Crunch on Thursday, September 9, 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> is still out on vacation for a few more days … even though he&#8217;s still tweeting a lot, which leads me to think he&#8217;s either bad at vacation or dislikes Twitter less than I do. Whatever the case, I&#8217;ll keep that daily recap goodness flowing to give you a glimpse into the biggest stories to cross our front page.</p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/"><strong>Facebook&#8217;s smart Ray-Bans:</strong></a> Five years after Snap shipped its Spectacle sunglasses, Facebook is taking a swing at the concept. But you won&#8217;t find the Facebook logo anywhere on these things (presumably because nobody on the planet wants the Facebook logo on their face). Built in partnership with Ray-Ban&#8217;s parent company, they look just like a classic pair of Wayfarers with an added bit of heft … and cameras. A white LED lights up when you&#8217;re shooting photos or videos, and near-ear speakers pipe in your tunes and phone calls. You can&#8217;t get them wet, which is great because no one wears sunglasses around places with water, like pools or beaches. Lucas Matney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebooks-first-smart-glasses-make-the-case-for-face-worn-wearables/">reviewed them here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/the-newest-roomba-gets-smarter-as-it-vacuums/"><strong>Roomba gets smarter:</strong></a> New Roomba incoming! The big new feature? It&#8217;ll try to detect and avoid poop your pets might have left in its path. Past models would just blast right through that mess and drag it around, leaving owners quite the horror show to come home to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/notion-acquires-indias-automate-io-in-push-to-accelerate-product-expansion/">Notion acquires Automate.io:</a></strong> Notion is buying Automate.io, a startup out of India that lets you easily hook into services like Mailchimp or Gmail or Salesforce (or Notion!) and create complex automated workflows. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sizable acquisition,&#8221; Notion&#8217;s COO said without disclosing exactly how much it spent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/solar-powered-aircraft-developer-skydweller-aero-adds-8m-to-series-a-partners-with-palantir/">Skydweller Aero raises $8M for solar-powered planes:</a></strong> &#8220;Airplanes and drones today, regardless of size or fuel type, all face the same limitation: eventually they have to land.&#8221; writes Aria Alamalhodaei. &#8220;Skydweller Aero, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, wants to break free from that constraint … &#8220;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/varo-bank-raises-510m-at-a-2-5b-valuation/">The $510M Series E:</a></strong> Varo Bank just won&#8217;t stop raising money. In June 2020, it raised $241 million, tacking on another $63 million in February 2021 because why not. Now it&#8217;s raised a staggering $510 million in a Series E round that values the company at $2.5 billion. “We didn’t set out to raise this much money. It was coming in fast and furious and we were at like $510 [million] and I finally said, ‘OK, enough,’” says Varo CEO Colin Walsh in a statement we can all totally relate to. Right? Anyone?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">Affinity raises $80M to use machine learning to close deals:</a></strong> Who in your organization is best suited to close that deal? Can machine learning algorithms chew through your company&#8217;s data (past email interactions, calendar availability, etc.) and recommend the right person? That&#8217;s part of what Affinity is working on, and they&#8217;ve raised another $80 million to keep the ball moving and the company growing. Affinity currently has 125 employees, with plans to balloon to over 200 in the next year.</li>

<h2>Anatomy of a SPAC: Inside Better.com’s ambitious plans</h2>
<p>Online mortgage company Better.com isn&#8217;t waiting to complete its SPAC merger before making big moves: Today, Ryan Lawler reported that it purchased Property Partners, a U.K.-based startup that offers fractional property ownership.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second company Better bought in recent months: In July, it snapped up digital mortgage brokerage Trussle.</p>
<p>“We aren’t so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg, who told Ryan that the company plans to soon expand into traditional financial services like auto loans and insurance.</p>
<p>Said CFO Kevin Ryan, “A lot of people have their niches in the way they’re attacking this, but we feel like we’re on a path to being full stack where everything’s embedded in the same flow.&#8221;</p>

The latest experiment: Communities, or moderated social hubs, in which you can tweet with others around a shared interest. Twitter is limiting the categories, for now, to topics like dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare and astrology, and presumably hoping to stay way, way, way far away from politics for as long as possible.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/microsoft-acquires-video-creation-and-editing-software-maker-clipchamp/">Microsoft is buying Clipchamp:</a></strong> Ever wished Microsoft&#8217;s 365 tool suite included a video editor? Seems it&#8217;s on the way. Microsoft announced that it&#8217;s buying up Clipchamp, a web-based tool for creating/editing videos. As for when it might be integrated into 365? TBD.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/quicken-one-of-the-first-fintechs-resold-to-another-private-equity-firm/">Quicken gets sold again:</a></strong> Well that was quick(en).

Quicken CEO Eric Dunn shared his thoughts on the deal (plus some insights on the company&#8217;s growth as of late) with TC&#8217;s Mary Ann Azevedo.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM unveiled Thursday the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, a full-sized pickup truck that received a major technology upgrade, including its hands-free Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system and an infotainment system with embedded Google services, as well as an overhauled interior. A new flagship trim, the off-road ZR2 truck with a factory-installed suspension lift, has also joined the Silverado lineup.</p>
<p>The Silverado refresh comes ahead of GM&#8217;s electric vehicle offensive, which will include Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">GM aims to deliver</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 30 new electric vehicles to the global market by 2025 and to transition to all zero-emission vehicles by 2035. GM said the new Silverado trims will arrive at dealerships in spring 2022.</span></p>
<p>The exterior of the Chevy Silverado also received a refresh, including new front fascia and daytime running lights that animate when the driver walks up or away from the vehicle. But the real change can be found in the cabin — and the hardware and software guts — of the truck.</p>

<p>Chevy offers the Silverado in the LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country trims, all of which come standard with a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine — now with 420 pound-feet of torque (up 20% over the previous model). The maximum tow rating on 2WD models is 9,600 pounds. GM also made changes to smooth out shifting and give drivers more power on demand.</p>
<p>The automaker also improved its 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel engine to enable a max tow rating of 13,300 pounds (2WD models). Two other powertrains, the 5.3-liter V8 and the 6.2-liter V8, are also offered.</p>
<p>The interior cabin has been revamped to make it feel more spacious and includes a 13.4-inch touchscreen and a new 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument cluster standard. Owners will also be able to add a rear camera mirror and a head-up display.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2200602" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200602" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200602 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg" alt="Chevrolet Silverado" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2200602" class="wp-caption-text">The first-ever 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: GM</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the Silverado interior will be offered in new colors, seat designs and premium materials. For model trims with bucket seats, the new center console incorporates an electronic shift controller.</p>
<p>Alexandre Scartezini, Chevrolet Truck&#8217;s lead interior designer, has described it as more contemporary and refined &#8220;with a hint of Corvette influence in its design DNA.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Everything Google</h2>
<p>Moving in deeper inside the vehicle, aka the infotainment, users will find Google, or more specifically Android Automotive, at the heart of the operating system. This means that Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play are all integrated into the infotainment screen.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn&#8217;t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system. Android Auto is an app that runs on the user&#8217;s phone and wirelessly communicates with the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Both Android Auto and its Apple CarPlay counterpart will be offered in the new Silverado. GM said the system also works with Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so automakers could use it in their cars. Google has offered an open source version of this OS to automakers for some time. In recent years, automakers have worked with the tech company to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services.</p>
<h2>Hands-free driving</h2>
<p>All of the Silverado trims come standard with six active safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and forward collision alerts, a warning if the vehicle leaves its lane, a following distance indicator, automatic high beams and front pedestrian braking.</p>
<p>The big change is the addition of the automaker&#8217;s Super Cruise hands-free driver-assistance technology, which will be an available option on the High Country trim. Importantly, the system can be used even while trailering. Certain features of Super Cruise like automatic lane changing and lane change on demand will be restricted if the truck is towing.</p>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>While GM has steadily improved Super Cruise since its introduction in 2017, for years it was limited to its luxury Cadillac brand and restricted to certain divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand it to more models and use cases. The system can be activated on more than 200,000 miles of roads in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The Silverado will offer other trailer assistance features, including one that will alert drivers to vehicles in their blind spot.</p>
