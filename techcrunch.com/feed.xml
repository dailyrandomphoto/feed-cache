										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has hired Roy Austin to become its first-ever VP of Civil Rights and Deputy General Counsel to create a new civil rights organization within the company, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/roy-austin-facebook-vp-civil-rights/">Facebook announced today</a>. Austin is set to start on January 19 and will be based in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Austin most recently served as a civil rights lawyer at Harris, Wiltshire &amp; Grannis LLP. Prior to that, Austin co-authored a report on big data and civil rights and worked with President Barack Obama&#8217;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights,&#8221; Austin said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2094669" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094669" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094669 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Roy-Austin-headshot-1-e1610389889326.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="226" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094669" class="wp-caption-text">Roy Austin, Facebook&#8217;s new VP of Civil Rights</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Technology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it’s important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it. I could not pass up the opportunity to join a company whose products are used by so many and which impacts the civil rights and liberties of billions of people, in order to help steer a better way forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what the goals or responsibilities of the civil rights organization within Facebook will be, but we&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for more information. In the meantime, here&#8217;s what Facebook&#8217;s Chief General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said on the company blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am delighted to welcome Roy to Facebook as our VP of Civil Rights. Roy has proved throughout his career that he is a passionate and principled advocate for civil rights — whether it is in the courtroom or the White House. I know he will bring the same wisdom, integrity and dedication to Facebook. It’s hard to imagine anyone better qualified to help us strengthen and advance civil rights on our platform and in our company.</p></blockquote>
<p>In July, former ACLU director Laura W. Murphy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/facebook-civil-rights-audit/">released the results of the multiyear investigation and civil rights audit of Facebook</a>. The report highlights some progress, such as Facebook changing its policy on discriminatory housing and employment ads, expanding its voter suppression policies and having more frequent meetings with civil rights leaders. But the auditors still raised a number of concerns, many of which pertained to the 2020 U.S. election and President Trump.</p>
<p>In light of a pro-Trump mob storming the U.S. Capitol last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg blocked Trump</a> from both Facebook and Instagram at least through the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before the pandemic, edtech companies went decades without raising financing due to lack of interest from generalist venture capitalists. Now, more than a year since COVID-19 began, the sector is showing signs of maturation, from first profits to unicorns, potential IPOs and a rush of talent.</p>
<p>Momentum in mind, cross-border venture capital firm <a href="https://www.superchargerventures.com/">SuperCharger Ventures</a> is launching a debut accelerator exclusively for early-stage edtech founders. The 12-week accelerator, which kicks off today, is being held virtually, with six startups in the debut cohort.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this isn’t the firms’ first time doing an accelerator. SuperCharger has led three cohorts of startups through a fintech-focused accelerator. The pivot from one booming category to another boils down to a simple dynamic, says SuperCharger Ventures co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbarberis/">Janos Barberis</a>: banks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Banks just don’t have the space or the bandwidth to start dealing with innovation right now,” Barberis said. The co-founder thinks that COVID-19 created a supply and demand unevenness between fintech services and banks, and as many branches struggle to stay open, “the first thing banks cut is innovation.”</p>
<p>So, the firm is hopping to edtech, and taking a key lesson with it from its fintech experience: the importance of B2B and recurring revenue streams.</p>
<p>“The corporate angle? It’s sticky, healthy and revenue driven,” Barberis said. “It’s healthy income, and I think right now investors are willing to pay for that healthy income.”</p>
<p>Financially, Barberis&#8217; argument is hard to disagree with. But when you look at some of the biggest edtech unicorns in this current moment, many are B2C, including Quizlet, Course Hero and ApplyBoard. It’s because in education, it sometimes can be easier to sell to the end-user than dealing with highly fragmented institutions &#8212; at least in the United States.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5cSXb5VGVm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/">4 edtech CEOs peer into the industry&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 edtech CEOs peer into the industry&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/embed/#?secret=5cSXb5VGVm" data-secret="5cSXb5VGVm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, B2B businesses have the biggest potential for reach, and we’re seeing consumer businesses turn COVID-19 demand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">into enterprise deals</a>. There’s also hope to be found internationally, which can sometimes have a less fragmented market of institutions, says Barberis.</p>
<p>Beyond B2B sales, cohort startups must be focused on expanding into European and Asian markets.</p>
<p>Barberis sees opportunity in those markets, minus China, because both appear to have gaps in edtech. In Europe, he says there’s a high demand for corporate digital learning from universities, and in Asia, he thinks that investor education is necessary so bets can be placed in countries beyond simply China. On one end there is demand, and on the other end there is opportunity to generate demand.</p>
<p>He leaves out China from the Asian market expansion because he thinks that the country, like the United States, is too saturated with companies right now.</p>
<p>The programming fits the normal accelerator model, with information tailored explicitly to the world of education, such as how to partner with an education institution or shorten sales cycles (as so much of edtech B2B sales happens during the summer months).</p>
<p>The firm doesn’t give any capital, but takes between 1-2% of equity in return for its services, which it estimates cost between $75,000 and $100,000 in “value.” SuperCharger culminates with a Demo Day, and companies in aggregate plan to raise between $15 to $20 million in venture capital.</p>
<p>Other firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/what-the-new-vc-show-and-tell-means-for-signaling-risk/">similarly created accelerator programs</a> during the pandemic to help with deal flow and stay competitive in the always-hot seed space, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">NextView Ventures.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>This isn’t SuperCharger Ventures’ first time doing an accelerator. The firm held three fintech-focused accelerators in the past, graduating 49 companies. The pivot from one booming sector to another comes from fintech saturation, says Barberis.</p>
<p>Out of 208 applications, SuperCharger landed on six companies in its <a href="https://www.superchargerventures.com/accelerator">debut cohort: </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been covering <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/infivention" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="infivention">Square Off <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for a couple of years now — ever since the connected chess startup competed in one of our pitch offs. The Mumbai-based startup has been rapidly iterating on technology that lets users play a physical chess game with opponents across the globe, including the arrival of the new modular gaming system, Swap.</p>
<p>Today at CES, it announced the upcoming arrival of a new rollable system, adding a level of portability to its offering. Obviously you lose some of the magic here — the self-moving pieces have been sacrificed in order to bring a board that can be rolled up and stashed in a backpack for easier transport. That effect was a big part of what made the tech so eye-catching in the first place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094651" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094651" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094651" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Square Off</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system will still take advantage of Square Off’s existing AI and connected technologies, allowing people to play globally against competitors. Between the continued inability to congregate in-person and the rise in interest in chess in the wake of Netflix’s wildly popular &#8220;The Queen’s Gambit,&#8221; this seems like an opportune time for the startup to launch a new product.</p>
<p>Unlike past offerings, the company won’t be going through a crowdfunding site to launch this one. Square Off expects to bring the product to market around March, priced at $199.</p>

Today&#8217;s announcement mostly focuses on the past, with a look back at the history of BMW&#8217;s infotainment platform, but the company did provide a bit more context and images of the new system that will make its official debut on the sizable displays in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">upcoming iX</a> soon.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re looking at a refreshed and more colorful design here. Based on what we can glance from the materials that BMW did make available, current BMW drivers shouldn&#8217;t have too high a learning curve as the overall layout still looks familiar.</p>
<p>Despite the addition of BMW&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/bmw-launches-a-personal-voice-assistant-for-its-cars/#:~:text=At%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20SF%202018,it%20any%20name%20you%20want.">personal voice assistant</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/bmws-magical-gesture-control-finally-makes-sense-as-touchscreens-take-over-cars/">gestures</a> in recent updates, the iDrive knob in the center console isn&#8217;t going away, though it looks like it will be getting some design tweaks, too. Clearly, though, BMW isn&#8217;t planning to do away with physical controls anytime soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The overall philosophy behind the update, BMW says, is to offer a system that is better able to utilize the potential of a connected car in order to &#8220;make the mobility experience even safer, even more comfortable and convenient, and even richer in variety.&#8221;</p>
<p>The argument here is that the car, thanks to its myriad of sensors and connectivity, now often has access to far more information than the driver. That, BMW says, has influenced the new iDrive&#8217;s design, but the company isn&#8217;t quite ready to delve into any details yet, it seems. Based on what we can glance from the materials that BMW did make available, though, current BMW drivers won&#8217;t have too high a learning curve as the overall layout still looks somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next generation of BMW iDrive takes the burgeoning relationship between a BMW and its driver to a new level,&#8221; the company writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The new system neatly bridges the gap between analogue and digital technology. And this, in turn, heralds another paradigm shift, as the number of available functions in a car and their complexity continue along a constant upward curve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pollen-robotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pollen-robotics">Pollen Robotics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> turned heads at last year’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. After all, a humanoid robot will do that on the show floor (even if it’s only half of one). The French startup is back for this year’s show (insofar as anyone is really back for the show), with some key updates to its robot, Reachy.</p>
<p>The biggest news this time out is the addition of teleoperation functionality using a virtual reality setup. Using a VR headset, a remote operator is capable of viewing video through the robot’s two face cameras. VR controllers are used to manipulate the robot’s arms for pick and place operations. The functionality can be used for, among other things, training the robot to perform tasks.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRWna6mEMv0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reachy is notable for being an open-source robotics platform. The $17,000 bot is potentially suitable for robotics research, including prototyping one’s own technology. As evidenced by last year’s event, it’s also a fun presentation robot, fulfilling a similar function as, say, Softbank’s Pepper. It’s not, however, going to be taking over any manufacturing jobs any time soon.</p>

<p>The robot’s software is built on the popular open-source robotics operating system, ROS 2. The on-board computer and cameras have both been upgraded since the company first showed off the robot roughly this time last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After rallying to record-setting prices, recapturing the attention of the public and becoming once-again the topic du jour, cryptocurrencies are losing ground today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, peaked at more than $41,000 apiece on January 8. Today after shedding a little over 23% in the last 24 hours, one bitcoin is now worth around $31,800.</p>
<p>Similarly, ether, the token associated with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ethereum-0ded" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ethereum-0ded">Ethereum <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> blockchain, peaked at a little over $1,300 on January 10. Today, after losing an even sharper 29% in the last 24 hours, ether tokens are worth around $960 apiece.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coins remain far above recent prices, with bitcoin setting new all-time highs this month and ether nearly reaching its early 2018 all-time highs. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, a data platform tracking the cryptocurrency market that was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binances-coinmarketcap-acquisition-is-a-bet-that-crypto-really-is-for-the-masses">purchased by the Binance exchange in 2020</a>, reports that the value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen by just over 22% in the last day to $832.4 billion.</p>
<p>Whether the recent declines, or the fact that cryptos were very recently worth north of $1 trillion in aggregate is bigger news will be determined by your perspective on the asset class.</p>
<p>For startups focused on the digital token market, however, it&#8217;s been a heady start to the year. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an American cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">filed to go public in late 2020</a>. The recent rally in the price of bitcoin, for example, has led to record trading volumes for the coin. That could translate into lucrative incomes for Coinbase and its rivals.</p>
<p>If so, the venture capital market could warm to companies in the space, opening wallets to crypto projects that may have been closed since 2017.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embattled social media platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is offline</a> after Apple, Google and Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">pulled the plug</a> on the site after the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol last week that left five people dead.</p>
<p>But while the site is gone (for now), millions of posts published to the site since the riot are not.</p>
<p>A lone hacker scraped millions of posts, videos and photos published to the site after the riot but before the site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">went offline on Monday</a>, preserving a huge trove of potential evidence for law enforcement investigating the attempted insurrection, many of which allegedly <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/">used the platform to plan and coordinate</a> the breach of the Capitol.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hacker and internet archivist, who goes by the online handle <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby">@donk_enby</a>, scraped the social network and uploaded <a href="https://archive.org/details/parler-com?sort=-addeddate">copies to the Internet Archive</a>, which hosts old and historical versions of web pages.</p>
<p>In a tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348281461435207680">@donk_enby</a> said she scraped data from Parler that included deleted and private posts, and the videos contained &#8220;all associated metadata.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">metadata such as <a href="https://t.co/f5y6AzZ3km">https://t.co/f5y6AzZ3km</a> <a href="https://t.co/95cXeCbZo6">pic.twitter.com/95cXeCbZo6</a></p>
<p>&mdash; crash override (@donk_enby) <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348294151712944128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Metadata is information about a file — such as when it was made and on what device. This information is usually embedded in the file itself. The scraped videos from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> appear to also include the precise location data of where the videos were taken. That metadata could be a goldmine of evidence for authorities investigating the Capitol riot, which may tie some rioters to their Parler accounts or help police to unmask rioters based on their location data.</p>
<p>Most web services remove metadata <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/slack-strips-location-data/">when you upload your photos and videos</a>, but Parler apparently wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Parler quickly became the social network of choice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">after President Trump was deplatformed</a> from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the riot on January 6. But the tech giants said Parler violated their rules by not having a content moderation policy – which is what drew many users to the site.</p>
<p>Many of the posts made calls to &#8220;burn down [Washington] D.C.,&#8221; while others called for violence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">and the execution</a> of Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>Already several rioters have been arrested and charged with breaking into the Capitol building. Many of the rioters weren&#8217;t wearing masks (the pandemic notwithstanding), making it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/trump-mob-tech-arrests/">easier for them</a> to be identified. But thanks to Parler&#8217;s own security blunder, many more could soon face an unwelcome knock at the door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The president of the United States is supposedly the most powerful man in the world. He also can’t post to Twitter. Or Facebook. Or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">a bunch of other social networks</a> as we discovered over the course of the past week (He still has access to the nuclear launch codes though, so that’s an interesting dynamic to chew on).</p>
<p>The bans last week were exceptional — but so is Trump. There may not be another president this century who pushes the line of public discourse quite like the current occupant of the White House (at least, one can only hope). If the whole Trump crisis was truly exceptional though, it could simply be ignored. Rules, even rules around free speech, have always had exceptions to handle exceptional circumstances. The president provokes a violent protest, he gets banned. A unique moment in American executive leadership, for sure. Yet, apart from the actor, it’s hardly an unusual response from the tech industry or any publisher where violent threats have been banned for decades under Supreme Court precedent.</p>
<p>Why then aren’t we ignoring it? I think we can all feel that something greater is underfoot. The entire information architecture of our world has changed, and that has completely upended the structure of rules around free speech that have governed America in the modern era.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Freedom of speech is deeply entwined with human progressivism, with science and rationality and positivism. The purpose of a marketplace of ideas is for arguments to be in dialogue with each other, to have their own facts and deductions checked, and for bad ideas to be washed out by better, more proven ones. Contentious at times yes, but a positive contention, one that ultimately is meant to elucidate more than provoke.</p>
<p>I’m a free speech “absolutist” because I believe in that human progress, and I believe that the concept of a marketplace of ideas is the best mechanism historically we have ever built as a species for exploring our world and introspecting ourselves. Yet, I also can’t witness the events that transpired last week and just pretend that our information commons is working well.</p>
<p>I get it — that seems contradictory. I understand the argument that I’m supporting free speech but not <i>really</i> supporting it. Yet, there is a reasonable pause to be taken in this moment to ask some deeper, more foundational questions, for something is wrong with the system. I’m struggling with the same context that the ACLU in its official statement is struggling with:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ACLU struggling here on this one&#8230;.this is American Civil Liberties Union after all. <a href="https://t.co/mWFOWJPwon">pic.twitter.com/mWFOWJPwon</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricLiptonNYT/status/1347734217371873280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It’s a milquetoast response, a “we condemn but we are also concerned” sort of lukewarm mélange. It’s also a reasonable response to a rapidly changing environment around speech. In the same vein, I’m a staunch defender of the marketplace of ideas, well, <i>a</i> marketplace of ideas, one that unfortunately no longer exists today. Just think about everything that isn’t working:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s too much information, and it’s impossible for any reasonable human to process it all</li>
<li>Much of that flood is garbage and outright fraud, or worse, brilliant pieces of psychological propaganda designed to distract and undermine the very information system it is distributed on</li>
<li>We’ve never allowed so many people to gain access to the public square to distribute their missives, drivel and invective with such limited constraints</li>
<li>Few ideas are in dialogue anymore. Collegiality is mostly dead, as is constructivist thought. There is no marketplace anymore since the “stores” are no longer in the same public squares but in each of our own individual feeds</li>
<li>Coercive incentives from a handful of dominant, monopoly platforms drive wildly damaging communication practices, encouraging the proverbial “clickbait” over any form of careful discussion or debate</li>
<li>The vast majority of people seem to love this, given the extremely high user engagement numbers seen on tech platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve known this event was coming for decades. Alvin Toffler’s <i>Future Shock</i>, about the inability of humans to process the complexity of the modern, industrialized world, came out in 1970. Cyberpunk literature and sci-fi more generally in the 1980s and 1990s has extensively grappled with this coming onslaught. As the internet expanded rapidly, books like Nicholas Carr’s <i>The Shallows</i> interrogated how the internet prevents us from thinking deeply. It was published a decade ago. Today, in your local bookstore (assuming you still have one and can actually still read texts longer than 1,000 words), you can find a whole wing analyzing the future of media and communications and what the internet is cognitively doing to us.</p>
<p>My absolute belief in “free speech” was predicated on some pretty clear assumptions about how free speech was supposed to work in the United States. Those assumptions, unfortunately, no longer apply.</p>
<p>We can no longer assume that there is a proverbial public square where citizens debate, perhaps even angrily, the issues that confront them. We can no longer assume that information dreck gets filtered by editors, or by publishers, or by readers themselves. We can no longer assume that the people who reach us with their messages are somewhat vetted, and speaking from truth or facts.</p>
<p>We can no longer assume that any part of the marketplace is frankly working at all.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this era so challenging for those of us who rely every day on the right to free speech in our work and in our lives. Without those underlying assumptions, the right to free speech isn’t the bastion of human progressivism and rationality that we expect it to be. Our information commons won’t ensure that the best and highest-quality ideas are going to rise to the top and propel our collective discussion.</p>
<p>I truly believe in free speech in its extensive, American sense. So do many friends who are similarly concerned for the perilous state of our marketplace of ideas. Yet, we all need to confront the reality that is before us: the system is really, truly broken and just screaming “Free Speech!” is not going to change that.</p>
<p>The way forward is to pivot the conversation around free speech to a broader question about how we improve the information architecture of our world. How do we ensure that creators and the people who generate ideas and analyze them can do so with the right economics? That means empowering writers and filmmakers and novelists and researchers and everyone else to be able to do quality work, over perhaps extended periods of time, without having to upload a new photo or insight every ten minutes to stay “top of mind” lest their income tumbles.</p>
<p>How can we align incentives at every layer of our communications to ensure that facts and “truth” will eventually win the day in the asymptote, if not always right away? How do you ensure that the power that comes with mass distribution of information is held by those who embody at least some notion of a public duty to accuracy and reasonableness?</p>
<p>Most importantly, how do we improve the ability of every reader and viewer to process the information they see, and through their independent actions drive the discussion toward rationality? No marketplace can survive without smart and diligent customers, and the market for information is no exception. If people demand lies, the world is going to supply it to them, and in spades as we have already seen.</p>
<p>Tech can’t solve this alone, but it absolutely can and is obligated to be part of the solution. Platform alternatives with the right incentives in place can completely change the way humanity understands our world and what is happening. That’s an extremely important and intellectually interesting problem that should be enticing to any ambitious engineer and founder to tackle.</p>
<p>I’ll always defend free speech, but I can’t defend the system in the state that we see it today. The only defense then is to work to rebuild this system, to buttress the components that are continuing to work and to repair or replace the ones that aren’t. I don’t believe the descent into rational hell has to be paved by misinformation. We all have the tools and power to make this system what it needs to be — what it should be.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">“A new law to follow” seems unlikely to have featured on many business wishlists this holiday season, particularly if that law concerned data privacy. Digital privacy management is an area that takes considerable resources to whip into shape, and most SMBs just aren’t equipped for it.</p>
<p>But for 2021, I believe startups in the United States should be demanding that legislators deliver a federal privacy law. Yes, they should demand to be regulated.</p>
<p>For every day that goes by without agreed-upon federal standards for data, these companies lose competitive edge to the rest of the world. Soon there may be no coming back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For every day that goes by without agreed-upon federal standards for data, these companies lose competitive edge to the rest of the world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Businesses should not view privacy and trust infrastructure requirements as burdensome. They should view them as keys that can unlock the full power of the data they possess. They should stop thinking about privacy as compliance and begin thinking of it as a harmonization of the customer relationship. The rewards flowing to each party from such harmonization are bountiful. The U.S. federal government is in a unique position to help realize those rewards.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean, cast your eyes to Europe, where it’s become clear that the GDPR was nowhere near the final destination of EU data policy. Indeed it was just the launchpad. Europe’s data regime can frustrate (endless cookie banners anyone?), but it has set an agreed-upon standard of protection for citizens and elevated their trust in internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>For example, a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/risk/deloitte-uk-risk-gdpr-six-months-on.pdf">Deloitte survey</a> found that 44% of consumers felt that organizations cared more about their privacy after GDPR came into force. With a baseline standard established — seatbelts in every car — Europe is now squarely focused on raising the speed limit.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers recently unveiled plans for &#8220;A Europe fit for the Digital Age.&#8221; in the words of Internal Market Commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/europes-data-strategy-aims-to-tip-the-scales-away-from-big-tech/">Thierry Breton</a>, it’s a plan to make Europe “the most data-empowered continent in the world.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ia4xHgXN1f"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/europes-data-strategy-aims-to-tip-the-scales-away-from-big-tech/">Europe&#8217;s data strategy aims to tip the scales away from big tech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s data strategy aims to tip the scales away from big tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/europes-data-strategy-aims-to-tip-the-scales-away-from-big-tech/embed/#?secret=Ia4xHgXN1f" data-secret="Ia4xHgXN1f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here are some pillars of the plan. While reading, imagine that you are a U.S.-based health tech startup. Imagine the disadvantage you would face against a similar, European-based company, if these initiatives came to fruition:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regulatory framework covering data governance, access and reuse between businesses, between businesses and government, and within administrations to create incentives for data sharing.</li>
<li>A push to make public-sector data more widely available by opening up “high-value datasets” to enable their reuse to foster innovation.</li>
<li>Support for cloud infrastructure, platforms and systems to support the data reuse goals, with investments in European high-impact projects on European data spaces and trustworthy, energy-efficient cloud infrastructures.</li>
<li>Sector-specific actions to build European data spaces that focus on specific areas such as industrial manufacturing, the Green New Deal, mobility or health.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many ways governments can help businesses maximize their data leverage in ways that improve society. But the American public currently has no appetite for that. They don’t trust the internet.</p>
<p>They want to see Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos sweating it out under Senate Committee questioning. Until we trust our leaders to protect basic online rights, widespread data empowerment initiatives will not be politically viable.</p>
<p>In Europe, the equation is totally different. GDPR was the foundation of a European data strategy, not the capstone.</p>
<p>While the EU powers forward, America’s ability to enact federal privacy reform is stymied by two quintessentially American privacy sticking points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I personally sue a business that violates my privacy rights?</li>
<li>Can individual states build additional privacy protections on top of a federal law, or will it act as a nationwide “ceiling”?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are important questions that must be answered as a function of our country’s unique cultural and political history. But currently they’re the roadblocks that stall American industry while the EU, seatbelts secure, begins speeding down the data autobahn.</p>
<p>If you want a visceral example of how this gap is already impacting American businesses, look no further than the fallout of the ECJ’s Schrems II decision in the middle of last summer. Europe’s highest court invalidated a key agreement used to transfer EU data back to the U.S., essentially because there’s no federal law to ensure EU citizens’ data would be protected once it lands in America.</p>
<p>The legal wrangling continues, but the impact of this decision was so considerable that Facebook legitimately threatened to quit operating Europe if the Schrems II ruling was enforced.</p>
<p>While issues generated for smaller businesses don’t grab as many headlines, rest assured that on the front lines of this issue, I’ve seen many SMB’s data operations thrown into total chaos. In other words, the geopolitical battle for a data-driven business edge is already well underway. We are losing.</p>
<p>To sum it up, the United States increasingly finds itself in a position that’s unprecedented since the dawn of the internet era: laggard. American tech companies still innovate at a fantastic rate, but America’s inability to marshal private sector practices to reflect evolving public sentiment threatens to become a yoke around the economy’s neck.</p>
<p>The catastrophic response to the COVID-19 pandemic fell far short of other nations’ efforts. Our handling of data privacy protection costs far less in human terms, but it grows astronomically more expensive in dollar terms with every passing day.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ethyca.com/data-mapping/">technology exists</a> to treat users respectfully in a cost-effective manner. The public will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/tech/data-privacy-pew-study/index.html">is there</a>.</p>
<p>The business will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/americas-largest-companies-push-for-federal-online-privacy-laws-to-circumvent-state-regulatory-efforts/">is there</a>. The legislative capability <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/10/26/how-the-2020-elections-will-shape-the-federal-privacy-debate/">is there</a>.</p>
<p>That’s why I believe America’s startup community should demand federal lawmakers follow the recent example of Europe, India, New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa and Canada. They need to introduce federally guaranteed modern data privacy protections as soon as possible.</p>

But this is about to change, as the company has applied for a banking license in the U.K. Up next, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are going to look at the application.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already has a banking license in the European Union. The Bank of Lithuania has granted a license and the company is taking advantage of European <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-36630606">passporting rules</a> to operate in other European countries.</p>
<p>It is slowly starting to offer its own banking products in Europe. Revolut is testing a credit offer in two European markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Revolut dubs itself as a financial super app. After you create an account, you get an e-wallet and a debit card. You can send and receive money, hold money in your account and use your card for in-store and online purchases.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Revolut has greatly expanded beyond that simple premise. You can buy cryptocurrencies, stocks and commodities. You can set money aside in a vault. You can get travel and mobile phone insurance products.</p>
<p>Some of these features have been developed in-house. Other features have required partnerships with other fintech companies. While you can do a lot of things with your Revolut account, it’s still not technically a bank in the U.K.</p>
<p>It has been great when it comes to growth, but it can be limiting when it comes to revenue opportunities and product offering. If Revolut gets a banking license, the company will be able to offer full-service current accounts with overdrafts and loans in the U.K. Revolut could also offer credit cards.</p>
<p>Customers will also be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). If Revolut becomes a bank and disappears, customers are protected up to £85,000 per person.</p>
<p>Revolut currently has 13 million customers and a valuation of $5.5 billion. While the company doesn’t break down its user base based on markets, the U.K. represents one of the most important markets for the company.</p>

<p>The students will gain access to the same version of Hulu&#8217;s streaming service, which includes its library of thousands of on-demand movies and TV, including Hulu Originals. They&#8217;ll also be able to use the recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Watch Party feature</a> that allows users to co-watch with friends and family in different locations as well as use group chat in a sidebar as the content plays.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Hulu has offered a variety of deals and discounts aimed at growing its user base. In fall 2017, for example, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/spotify-and-hulu-partner-on-a-discounted-entertainment-bundle-first-aimed-at-students/">partnered with Spotify</a> on a combo deal, also aimed at students. It later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/spotify-expands-its-4-99-per-month-student-bundle-with-hulu-to-include-showtime/">expanded</a> this deal to include Showtime and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/spotify-and-hulu-launch-a-discounted-entertainment-bundle-for-12-99-per-month/">opened</a> it to a broader audience. In 2019, Hulu also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/hulu-drops-the-price-for-its-streaming-service-to-6-per-month-but-raises-prices-for-live-tv/">again dropped</a> the standard price for its streaming service while raising the cost of its Live TV add-on and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/hulu-and-spotify-launch-an-even-more-steeply-discounted-bundle-of-9-99-per-month/">rolled out</a> an even more discounted Spotify-Hulu combo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4AbDSxki5e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu officially launches its co-viewing feature, Watch Party</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These promotions help to boost Hulu&#8217;s subscriber base to its entry-level service in the hopes that users will later choose to upgrade to Hulu&#8217;s more expensive plans. For students, in particular, the goal is to capture the market while users are young and paying for subscriptions possibly for the first time. When the students graduate, Hulu believes they&#8217;ll continue to still see the value in its service and convert to fully paid customers.</p>
<p>This new student deal arrives a couple of months after Hulu once again <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">raised the price of its Hulu with Live TV plan</a> &#8212; this time to help fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/hulus-live-tv-service-gains-14-new-channels-as-result-of-viacomcbs-deal/">the addition</a> of 14 new ViacomCBS channels. As Hulu&#8217;s Live TV service becomes to look more like traditional pay TV in terms of its pricing, it becomes even more important to attract users to Hulu&#8217;s on-demand plan as the first step toward later upsells.</p>
<p>Hulu says the new student deal is &#8220;evergreen&#8221; and begins to roll out today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the world of annual refresh cycles, there’s always been a big question mark around what to do with all of the old tech we too readily abandon. There are a number of options for disposing and recycling these objects that often contain rare earth and sometimes harmful material. The concept of upcycling has also become an increasingly popular option &#8212; offering a new lease on life for old technology. After all, your three-year-old smartphone may not be the latest and greatest, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily worthless.</p>
<p>During this morning’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> kickoff press conference, Samsung outlined its new Galaxy Upcycling at Home program. For now, we got some pretty broad strokes about the program &#8212; and we’ll likely get more information at this Friday’s Galaxy Unpacked event. Here’s what the company had to say: “The new program reimagines the lifecycle of an older Galaxy phone and offers consumers options on how they might be able to repurpose their device to create a variety of convenient IoT tools.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Examples from the presser include a baby monitor, pet-care sensor for turning on lights remotely and a more abstract “digitally safe home” using Samsung Knox. It will be interesting to see what else the company’s got in store on that front &#8212; and certainly there’s something to be said for keeping old tech relevant even after its planned obsolescence.</p>
<p>The other piece of the puzzle is one of the more fun initiatives the company has introduced in recent years, with boxes that can be converted into household objects. The company announced this morning that all of its QLED, UHD TV and audio projects will feature the packaging.</p>
<p>Per Samsung:</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of an ongoing commitment to eco-consciousness, Samsung is creating products and solutions with sustainability at the core. For example, Samsung’s new Solar Cell Remote Control—made in part with recycled plastic—can be charged via solar or indoor lighting, reducing battery waste.</p></blockquote>

The service suspension went into effect overnight after a 24-hour warning from AWS, which means that if you now go to Parler&#8217;s web address you&#8217;re greeted with a message saying the requested domain can&#8217;t be reached.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s community had been surging after the permanent<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/"> suspension of Trump&#8217;s official accounts from Twitter and Facebook last week</a>, which also saw removed from those platforms a number of accounts tweeting similar invectives and encouragement of violence aligned with Trump&#8217;s sentiments. Apple and Google then removed Parler from their respective app stores for violations of their own terms of service, and AWS follows suit with its own suspension notice.</p>

<p>The company has suggested that it will rebuild its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-cuts-off-parler-ceo-aims-to-rebuild-infrastructure/">own infrastructure</a> from scratch in order to contend with the various suspensions, but meanwhile other alternative social media sites that continue to exist, and that have typically catered to a more right-wing audience, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">like Gab</a>, are seeing the benefits of Parler&#8217;s deplatforming. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gab-online" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gab-online">Gab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has previously seen its hosting revoked, and been removed from Google Play for issues around hate-speech dissemination.</p>

<p>With this new corporate structure, Orange could attract third-party investors in its fund. Other telecom companies have made some headlines with their venture funds in the past, such as SoftBank’s Vision Fund and Reliance Jio.</p>
<p>Separating <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orange-digital-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orange-digital-ventures">Orange Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from Orange is also going to boost confidence when it comes to confidentiality and conflicts of interest between a startup and the telecom company. There’s a more visible firewall between Orange and Orange Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But if you want to partner with Orange, there are some opportunities on the table — the company says those synergies are “flexible and optional”.</p>
<p>Orange Ventures focuses on investments in companies that operate more or less in the same space as Orange. It includes many verticals, such as connectivity, cybersecurity, fintech and e-health. Previous investments <a href="https://ventures.orange.com/portfolio/">include</a> Monzo, Luko, Raisin, YouVerify and WeaveWorks.</p>
<p>Orange Ventures currently has offices in Paris and Dakar and tends to invest in startups from seed stage up to Series A or B. The firm says it can invest as much as €20 million in a single round. It is screening startups in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the U.S. There are around 20 people working for Orange Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your startup&#8217;s pitch deck could be the difference between getting funded or getting ignored. It&#8217;s often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but it&#8217;s also a bit of a black box.</p>
<p>How do these investors consume this content? Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we&#8217;re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We&#8217;ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we&#8217;re cranking it up a notch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a part of Extra Crunch Live, our weekly event series that connects investors and founders, we&#8217;ll be offering EC members the chance to get live feedback on their pitch decks from our guests. You heard that right. Every single week, VCs and big-name tech founders will look through pitch decks from the Extra Crunch community and offer their two cents.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where you come in. We&#8217;re asking EC members to <strong><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit their pitch decks right here!</a></strong></p>
<p>Only EC members will have the chance to get their pitch deck looked at, so please use the same email attached to your Extra Crunch account when you submit.</p>
<p>Last week, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">shared what you can expect from Extra Crunch Live in 2021</a>. Here&#8217;s a refresher:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/redwood-materials-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="redwood-materials-3">Redwood Materials, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has quietly opened up its enterprise to everyday consumers and all of the old electronics sitting in their junk drawers.</p>
<p>The move expands upon the Carson City, Nevada-based company&#8217;s existing and primary strategy to recycle scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics for corporate customers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/panasonic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="panasonic">Panasonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon.</p>
<p>The startup has posted a <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/recyclewithus">&#8220;recycle with us&#8221;</a> tab on its website, which states &#8220;Have lithium ion batteries or e-waste? We’ll recycle your phones, tablets, power tools and any other device with a lithium-ion battery.&#8221; There isn&#8217;t any more information on the website beyond an address, where consumers can send their e-waste, and a &#8220;contact us&#8221; button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Straubel told TechCrunch in October that its business model could someday evolve to include consumers because they had received so many inquiries from people. It seems that Redwood has decided to take the leap.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials isn&#8217;t setting strict parameters on what consumers can send, a spokesperson said, who confirmed the company is even taking cables. Redwood told TechCrunch it wants to hear from consumers and will determine over time how it might expand the program. For instance, the company said it might formalize the consumer program and add shipping boxes and labels to make the process easier.</p>
<p>For now, Redwood is going to open it up and see what happens.</p>
<p>The majority of lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other consumer electronics are not recycled and instead either sit forgotten in the owner’s junk drawer or enter the waste stream and end up in a landfill.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Redwood Material is aiming to change that by creating a circular supply chain. Redwood collects scrap from Panasonic&#8217;s battery cell production as well as consumer electronics such as cell phone batteries, laptop computers and power tools from other corporations. The company then processes the discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers.</span></p>
<p>Eventually, Straubel wants Redwood to be part of the end-of-life solution for electric vehicle batteries as well. The CEO has aspirations to set up facilities in strategic regional locations around the world to meet this need. For now, most of the items recycled and processed at Redwood&#8217;s two facilities in Carson City are for Panasonic and other unnamed consumer electronics-related companies.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s on the docket for today? A great host of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">broadly deplatformed</a>, which is controversial not only amongst his political allies and acolytes, but also amongst those worried that fringe-yet-not-wrong views could suffer in the future.</li>
<li>Parler, a Twitter clone that tried to claim the mantle of free speech &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">despite having posting rules</a> &#8212; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">cut off by major tech companies</a> over its inability to censor calls for violence. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">It had recently hit No. 1 in the App Store</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and other cryptos are in correction, as the stock market preps to give back some recent gains. All this while the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">electric car market keeps getting hotter and hotter</a> as Chinese tech companies link up with auto makers to get their own vehicles into the market.</li>
<li>On the funding round front, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/indonesian-investment-platform-ajaib-gets-25-million-series-a-led-by-horizons-venture-and-alpha-jwc/">Ajaib Group raised $25 million</a> as the low-cost trading boom grows around the world. And, Keep, a Chinese fitness app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/vision-fund-keep-360-million-funding/">raised a megaround</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing, I am befuddled by how dissonant the global economy feels, with seemingly two different eras going on at once. It&#8217;s not clear if I have finally become the softy I have always threatened to become, or merely that the inequality of outcomes in the 2020-2021 economy are merely as heartbreaking as I imagine them to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the last couple of years, Samsung’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> press conferences have featured a parade of futuristic home robots. They are smart, dexterous and impressive (and reasonably adorable). But home robots are hard. Like, really, really hard. There’s a reason the robotic vacuum continues to be one real viable home robot nearly 20 years after the Roomba&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>It’s the same reason the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum seems to be the one really viable bit of home robotics from the event. The company also showed off updates to the Bot Handy it introduced at last year&#8217;s show. That, coupled with the new Bot Care, is far more in line with the kind of humanoid designs science fiction has led us believe we’ll be getting in the next few years.</p>
<p>And science fiction seems to still be an operative descriptor here. At last year&#8217;s show, the robots put on a kind of Chuck E. Cheese-style presentation, running through choreographed tasks on stage, with limited human interaction. Understandably &#8212; there’s a lot that goes into this sort of thing, and for the moment, the technology feels like proof of concept more than anything.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2094451" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094451" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Recording-2021-01-11-at-9.50.06-AM.2021-01-11-09_51_21.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="547" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094451" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>The company mentioned the “not too distant future” in reference to the tech, while the small print at the corner of the screen said “This robot is undergoing research and development, and is not yet for sale.” That seems to be putting it mildly, as the wheeled Bot Care reminds its owner of a meeting and pops up a screen for a conference call.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone has an illusions that we’ll be seeing any of this tech during the current pandemic, though I suppose there’s an argument to be made that this is the “new normal” the company is prepping us for. The Bot Handy moving dishes from the sink to dishwasher seems roughly as realistic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094455" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094455" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg 2416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>I’m happy to be wrong, but I don’t think any of us are holding our breath for a viable version of this tech in the near term. We can, however, appreciate the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum. That, after all, has a rough date, arriving in the U.S. at some point in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The robot vacuum features an on-board lidar sensor, coupled with an object detection algorithm that helps it build an ideal path around the user’s home. Interestingly, the camera can also be viewed remotely by the user, doubling as a kind of security cam (though Samsung seems to avoid actually using the word) and a pet monitor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">National Cancer Institute</a>, some 1.8 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year in the U.S. alone. Factor in the friends, family and loved ones of those patients, and the number of people affected by this disease can boggle the mind.</p>
<p>Liya Shuster-Bier understands this struggle all too well. After her mother was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, she herself was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, transitioning from caregiver to patient to survivor. Her experience led her to start <a href="https://myalula.com/">Alula</a>, a platform for those fighting cancer, that launches officially today.</p>
<p>Alongside its launch, Alula is also announcing that it closed a $2.2 million seed round from BBG Ventures, Andy Dunn, Metrodora Ventures, Thrive Capital, Village Global, Homebrew, Shrug Capital, Basement Ventures, Company Ventures, K5 Global, K50 Ventures, and several angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the sheer number of people affected by cancer and cancer treatment, there aren&#8217;t many resources out there to help them understand what to expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are researching scattered parts of the internet for various elements of product recommendations, ways to communicate ways to raise money for your treatment, ways to understand how to tell people or to announce to your boss that you have treatment,&#8221; said Shuster-Bier. &#8220;It is not in a singular place, it is not organized in a radically honest way. It&#8217;s hard to understand who to trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alula is a multi-pillared platform that, in the words of Shuster-Bier, takes a radically honest approach to preparing its users for everything they&#8217;ll go through during their treatment. That includes products they&#8217;ll need to deal with the treatment process, communication tools to help coordinate support, and content to encourage and support patients on their journey.</p>
<p>Shuster-Bier explained that her oncologists and doctors prepared her for some of the after effects of her treatment, like losing her hair, but couldn&#8217;t recommend a good place to purchase a wig, for example. So Alula has built out a marketplace with products that have been recommended by patients, and guided by an advisory board of medical experts. It includes personalized registries and &#8216;cancer survival kits&#8217; that are categorized by the type of treatment a patient is going through.</p>
<p>Alula also provides communication tools to users. Many people use email to share the news of their cancer diagnosis with their friends and family. It&#8217;s often the most difficult email a person has ever had to write, says the company, and Alula guides them through that process with customizable templates. Alula also provides shareable treatment calendars to help coordinate a ride to treatment or organizing people to sit with patients at treatment, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094447" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094447" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="638" class="size-large wp-image-2094447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=768,721 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=680,638 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094447" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alula</p></div></p>
<p>The truth is that the cancer journey is never really over. There is always something new to be prepared for and understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am continuously surprised how the after effects persist and are new,&#8221; explained Shuster-Bier. &#8220;I&#8217;m currently struggling with medically induced menopause, at the tender age of 32. I just recently got diagnosed with radiation fibrosis in my chest and back, which is the stiffening of my muscles from my radiation, and I am seeing a cardiologist because one of the chemo drugs that I needed was cardiotoxic.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address this, the company is also building out a library of content to help patients and caregivers navigate the difficult process. This type of information is usually only found through conversations with other cancer patients during treatment, and Alula is looking to centralize and organize that content for its users.</p>
<p>Right now, the business model is focused on affiliate fees that come from the marketplace, but Shuster-Bier explained that Alula is looking to start buying products wholesale that it can retail.</p>
<p>Today, Shuster-Bier is not only celebrating the launch of Alula, but of her three-year cancerversary and nearly two years of being in remission.</p>

You can expect bigger, slimmer and brighter TVs. I’m not going to list the specifications of new models. But there are a few new features that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>LG doesn’t use Android TV for the operating system. Instead, the company has its own operating system called webOS. App developers have to release specific versions of their apps for LG’s smart TVs. And the company announced that Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now are coming to LG 2021 TVs.</p>
<p>Google’s cloud gaming service will arrive first in the coming months. It won’t be available everywhere, as Stadia is only available in a handful of countries. But if you live in a country where Stadia is available, you will be able to unplug your Chromecast to access Stadia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stadia works a bit like a console that runs in the cloud. You can buy games and run them in a data center near you. The video feed is streamed directly to your screen and your gamepad controls are relayed to the server.</p>
<p>As for Nvidia’s cloud gaming service, it is coming later this year. This service is a bit different as you can take advantage of your Steam, Epic Games, GOG or Ubisoft Connect libraries.</p>
<p>Nvidia has favored its own set-top box in the past with a GeForce Now app on the Nvidia Shield TV. Recently, the Android app has been updated with support for more devices, and it looks like it’s expanding beyond Android TV with webOS support.</p>
<p>LG also announced that it is updating webOS with a brand new interface this year. The overlay menu at the bottom of the screen has been replaced with a full-screen menu. You’ll be able to find your favorite apps, access live TV and get some content recommendations — and, yes, there will be ads.</p>
<p>If you’re playing games, there will be a new game menu to access the most relevant settings. For instance, you’ll be able to switch from one TV profile to another from that menu depending on the type of games that you’re playing (FPS, racing games, etc.). It sounds pretty useless to me, as you mostly want to reduce latency as much as possible with <em>any</em> genre. You’ll also be able to turn on G-Sync and FreeSync if you’re using a compatible device.</p>
<p>When it comes to new OLED TVs, there are the entry-line A1 models with old processors, and the C1 models with support for modern game consoles thanks to variable refresh rate, low latency, etc. At the top of the lineup, the G1 models come in three different sizes (77 inches, 65 inches and 55 inches).</p>
