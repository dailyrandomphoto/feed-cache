										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $19.7BN acquisition of speech-to-text specialist Nuance by Microsoft, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">earlier this year</a>, has attracted the attention of the UK&#8217;s active antitrust watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-corporation-slash-nuance-communications-inc-merger-inquiry">said today</a> it&#8217;s taking a first look to assess whether there are reasons to be concerned about the proposed deal.</p>
<p>A decision on whether the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will open a phase 1 investigation will follow in due course.</p>
<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no stated timeframe for the regulator to take a decision on that &#8212; but a consultation period in which the CMA is inviting interested parties to comment runs until January 10, 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antitrust oversight of proposed acquisitions can stretch to many months &#8212; and can, at the least, lead to major delays to clearing transactions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WTxn7wgXmR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/embed/#?secret=WTxn7wgXmR" data-secret="WTxn7wgXmR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement on the development, the CMA said it is &#8220;considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time Microsoft announced the Nuance acquisition, back in April, the software giant said it was buying the speech-to-text firm in order to strengthen its presence in the healthcare vertical &#8212; where Nuance has developed a number of clinician-support products (such as tech for documenting telehealth visits; a speech recognition tool for clinical documentation; and AI-powered radiology reporting, among other software tools).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK&#8217;s antitrust regulator may decide the planned acquisition merits further scrutiny &#8212; at which point it would open a phase 1 investigation. If after that it decides there is still reason to be concerned it may open a deeper, phase 2 probe.</p>
<p>It may also decide during one of the stages of its process that there are no competition issues of concern and clear the acquisition.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the flip side, if it has concerns it could decide remedies are required before it can go ahead or even order the transition blocked.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been contacted for comment on the CMA&#8217;s preliminary probe of its planned purchase of Nuance.</p>
<p>Healthcare has been a vertical of growing interest to tech giants for a number of years &#8212; with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/amazon-will-expand-its-amazon-care-on-demand-healthcare-offering-u-s-wide-this-summer/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-takes-wraps-off-40m-ai-for-health-initiative/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/facebook-unveils-its-first-foray-into-personal-digital-healthcare-tools/">even Facebook</a> all taking an interest in building tools for tracking, monitoring or otherwise supporting health &#8212; raising concerns that their ambitions in such a sensitive area will further entrench their dominance and market power as a vital sector steps up digitization.</p>
<p>The UK, meanwhile, is in the process of retooling domestic competition law to take account of platform power &#8212; and has said it will be bringing in a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition&#8221; regime which it wants to protect smaller innovators from the market muscle of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of legislation to empower a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a>, which sits inside the CMA, to oversee big tech the competition watchdog continues to scrutinize M&amp;A activity and other major moves (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">Google&#8217;s strategic &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; plan</a>).</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">recently, the regulator ordered Meta (aka Facebook) to undo a completed acquisition</a> of animated GIF platform Giphy &#8212; a notable development in competition oversight given how few big tech M&amp;As have been challenged, historically &#8212; underscoring how the CMA is at the forefront of challenging platform power and ambition (even when &#8212; in that instance &#8212; the order requires a messy transaction reversal).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">the SenseTime IPO is on hold</a> leaves the stock market with just one major tech listing on the horizon: Samsara&#8217;s public debut, which is <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo-calendar/">currently anticipated</a> to price Tuesday and trade Wednesday. That makes it the perfect moment to sit back and chat through a few of the year&#8217;s biggest offerings and how they performed post-debut.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Two things are on my mind. First, what happened to some of the most famous IPO pops from the last year? With rising retail trading around the world thanks to companies like Robinhood and WeBull, some recent tech offerings have had simply massive early trading sessions. Did those initial gains persist? Or did they evaporate, leaving the IPO mispricing conversation somewhat overblown?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, second, what happened to the handful of SPACs that we felt made some reasonable sense before their combination was completed? How is Latch doing? And SoFi?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us.</p>
<h2>So, what about those insane IPO pops?</h2>
<p>If you turn the clock back to one year ago, DoorDash and C3.ai had just gone public, and both racked up simply excellent early returns. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">TechCrunch noted on December 9</a>, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="speakable-summary">Haters gonna hate, IPOs gonna pop. That’s the story today as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">richly valued DoorDash and C3.ai</a>, two American technology unicorns, saw their values skyrocket after they began trading today.</p>
<p>DoorDash shares are up just under 83% to $186.51. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">priced its IPO at $102 per share</a> last night, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raised IPO range of $90 to $95 per share</a>. &#8230; [S]hares of C3.ai are up an even sharper 151% to $105.58, after pricing at $42 per share earlier today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>discourse</em> at the time was that those IPOs were bad in that they were priced incorrectly. That, essentially, bankers had sold their IPO share too cheaply, effectively rewarding their own client base while undercutting the fundraising results of both DoorDash and C3. Well, how have things gone since?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe today launched <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/">Creative Cloud Express</a>, a new mobile and web app that brings some of the best features of the company&#8217;s sprawling Creative Cloud Suite and Acrobat PDF tools into a single application to help users quickly create anything from social media posts to promotional posters and videos.</p>
<p>Using a template-first approach with built-in access to stock images and other assets, Creative Cloud Express is meant to be far more accessible than the individual Creative Cloud apps. The app will come in both a free version and a paid $9.99/month edition with additional capabilities and a library of more complex templates. Access to the new application will also be includes in Adobe&#8217;s Creative Cloud All Apps and flagship single-app <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html">plans</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246376" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246376" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Besides the web app, a free app is now also available in Apple&#8217;s app store, Google Play and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>The general idea behind Creative Cloud Express is to give non-professionals the tools they need to bring their vision to life. As Adobe&#8217;s Ashley Still noted, the company has seen a lot of growth from non-professional users in recent years. But while a lot of these users may initially think they want the precision and control of a full Creative Cloud app, the reality is that what they often really want is a fast and easy way to accomplish the same tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing with Creative Cloud Express is we&#8217;re taking all the learnings from our breadth of web and mobile apps, as well as our core Creative Cloud technology &#8212; whether it&#8217;s Photoshop and imaging or video &#8212; and we&#8217;re bringing it into a unified offering called Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; Still said. &#8220;This is really for people who are focused on outcome and not process. They don&#8217;t want to start with a blank page, they want to start with an image from the 175 million strong Adobe Stock library. They don&#8217;t want to create a font, they want to get access to one of our 20,000 amazing fonts from the Adobe Font library. They don&#8217;t want to go to multiple applications to create a flyer and then create a PDF so they can print it. They want to be able to do it all in one place.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246377" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246377" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246377" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In practice, this means you get access to a vast library of templates to get started, but also tools to quickly remove the background from an image or apply Photoshop-style filters and effects to these images. Thanks to an integration with Creative Cloud Libraries, users will also be able to take assets from Photoshop and Illustrator that maybe a colleague created for them and then re-use them in the Creative Cloud Express app.</p>
<p>There are also tools to convert videos to GIFs, convert documents to PDFs and more. One interesting aspect here is the integration of <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/">Adobe Stock</a>, which doesn&#8217;t feature a free plan but which is integrated (with some limitations) into the free version of Creative Cloud Express. Free users will get access to about 1 million images and other assets. Premium plan users will get access to 175 million Adobe Stock photos, 20,000 fonts and access to Photoshop Express and Premiere Rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less is more in Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be able to do everything in Photoshop. Like you don&#8217;t need neural filters, but you do need to be able to do a few simple things like remove a background or make simple edits to an image. With Acrobat, you don&#8217;t need to password protect a PDF, you need to be able to create a PDF, edit a PDF. A lot of the simplicity comes with our own editing of what are the few most important things that that people need to achieve? What are their intentions?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246379" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246379" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246379" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>In some ways, Creative Cloud Express feels a bit like Spark, its tools for building social graphics, short videos and web sites, on steroids. Adobe wouldn&#8217;t say so, but if you think of this as Spark on steroids, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re very far off as Creative Cloud Express shares a lot of the user interface design and overall philosophy. Indeed, if you went to <a href="http://adobe.com/express">adobe.com/express</a> before the launch, it would redirect you to the Spark homepage.</p>
<p>But as Still noted, the company isn&#8217;t seeing this as a replacement for applications like Spark, Photoshop Express or Premiere Rush, all of which are also meant to take some of Adobe&#8217;s core features and AI tools and make them more accessible.</p>
<p>The target audience is also a bit wider for Creative Cloud Express. Adobe wants it to become the go-to content creation tool for anybody from students to small business owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has a story to tell and it’s our mission to empower everyone to express their ideas,&#8221; said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud, Adobe. &#8220;In this unique time, where millions of people are building a personal and professional brand, we’re excited to launch Creative Cloud Express as a simple, template-based tool that unifies the creation, collaboration and sharing process so anyone can create with ease.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has rolled out a new &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515">Reels Visual Replies</a>&#8221; feature that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they&#8217;ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply. The social media giant notes that the video reply will appear as a sticker.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love the communities that creators have built on Instagram,&#8221; Instagram said in a tweet announcing the new feature. &#8220;That’s why we’re excited to launch Reels Visual Replies, a new feature to interact with your audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s newest feature further integrates Reels into its wider social media platform. It&#8217;s worth noting that the new feature is similar to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video">TikTok&#8217;s video replies</a>, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of the feature, it&#8217;s no surprise that Instagram has launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone.</p>
<p>The launch of Reels Visual Replies comes as Instagram has been rolling out several new features. Most recently, the company introduced a new end-of-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/">&#8220;Playback&#8221; IG Stories</a> time capsule feature. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for &#8220;several weeks.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram has also rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/">“Rage Shake”</a> feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. The social media giant also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/"> introduced the ability</a> to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this update, you can delete items from an existing carousel.</p>
<p>The company is also testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">“Take a Break,”</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. There&#8217;s also a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">“Add Yours” sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “last mile” in the supply chain has gotten lots of attention during the pandemic. Even ecommerce giants like Amazon have struggled to surmount the challenges of distributing product fast enough to keep up with demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Factor, a startup created in 2018 by manufacturing industry veterans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Shultz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Szewczyk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just raised a seed round to streamline a different part of the supply chain process, which it calls the “first mile.” For Factor’s 250+ customers, mostly manufacturing companies, the “first mile” consists of processes like ordering raw materials, choosing the ideal supplier for each order, and paying them on time, Factor CEO Shultz told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people look at the supply chain and they think about the shipping containers stuck in LA or the boats outside the port of Long Beach. The exciting thing for us is the problems that we&#8217;re solving more upstream in the chain can really help companies avoid getting in those types of bottlenecks in the first place,” Shultz said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ventilator shortage at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from inefficiencies in the “first mile” of manufacturing, Shultz said. It took six months for supply to meet demand in that scenario because of “manual and tedious” standard practices across the industry, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What caused it to take six months, even with Elon Musk and Tim Cook personally involved, was that inside of that process, there are 700 components that are coming from 200 first-tier suppliers, and then hundreds more underneath that first tier. If you think about how companies order stuff and pay each of these suppliers when there are literally thousands of different moving parts, that’s what takes six months,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246393" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?w=300" alt="Factor cofounders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk" width="450" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg 4475w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246393" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor cofounders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor’s product helps companies manage transaction infrastructure throughout the “first mile” by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate core supply chain processes. It provides payment tools, data to aid in supplier selection, and order tracking and execution features to its customers, who tend to make complex products for industrial use in areas like robotics, medical devices, and aerospace and defense, Shultz said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies using Factor bring their own suppliers onto the platform, and Factor helps them measure data about each supplier’s outcomes – for example, how many times a supplier has delivered goods to them on time. Factor is “less so a marketplace, more so an infrastructure to help you make decisions,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that don’t use Factor typically use manual tools like spreadsheets to manage their “first mile” processes. Others use enterprise resource planning (ERP) software through providers like Oracle and SAP, which is more easily customizable but oftentimes prohibitively expensive for mid-size and small companies to use, Shultz continued.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246394" style="width: 3781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246394" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246394 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png" alt="Factor's parts status tracking feature" width="3771" height="2620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png 3771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=1536,1067 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=2048,1423 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3771px) 100vw, 3771px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246394" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor&#8217;s parts status tracking feature<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor hopes to provide a more reasonably priced supplier management service for these sorts of companies, but it also sees its payment features as key differentiators from other ERPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manufacturing industry accounts for over 20% of B2B payments globally, Shultz said, but many of the largest companies in the industry are still transferring vast amounts of money through paper checks. Factor’s platform offers automated payment features built on top of infrastructure from payment processors like Stripe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re layering on top of that infrastructure applications that can essentially coordinate where the payments are going, and also provide additional value. We have all this data about your order history or suppliers, and we can now pull in the financial services on top of that,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has seen customer order volume grow 10x in the past nine months, announced today it had raised $6 million in seed funding to grow its platform. Google’s AI-focused fund, Gradient Ventures, led the round alongside other investors Xfund, Afore, and South Park Commons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the capital to further develop its financial services capabilities by adding new banking partners and offering financing products, Shultz said. It is currently working with a credit provider to develop a credit functionality for companies to fund their short-term working capital needs, he added, though he declined to name the credit provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shultz, who hired Factor’s first head of sales a few weeks ago, said he was excited to receive backing from Darian Shirazi at Gradient Ventures because of Shirazi’s big-picture view of the company’s growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirazi understood that “buyers are always suppliers, suppliers are our buyers, and we can turn on this viral engine to [become] the base transaction layer for all of manufacturing,” Shultz said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/">Sirius XM</a>, home to the satellite radio business and streaming music app Pandora, is bringing on a new head of product and technology, as the company plans to expand its focus beyond the car to better compete with streaming rivals, like Spotify. The company this morning announced its hiring of former MLB and Disney exec Joseph Inzerillo as its new Chief Product and Technology Officer. He will begin his new role on Jan. 10, 2022.</p>
<p>Jim Cady, Sirius XM&#8217;s Chief Innovation Officer, who has been serving as Interim Head of Product Development, will be retiring after eight years with the company. He will work with Inzerillo through Feb. 2022 during the transition.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the audio entertainment company, Inzerillo was an Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for Disney&#8217;s streaming arm, where he helped to oversee all aspects of that business, including the streaming, commerce, platform development, and globalization plans for Disney+, ESPN+. Star+ and Hulu. Inzerillo had first joined Disney in 2017 with its acquisition of BAMTech Media, where he had served as EVP and Chief Technology Officer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://press.hulu.com/?hulupress_executive=joe-inzerillo">Previously</a>, Inzerillo had been CTO for Major League Baseball, including its flagship media companies MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network. In this role, he launched MLB.tv, the first over-the-top sports offering, &#8220;instant replay,&#8221; wireless connectivity in all 30 ballparks, and shaped MLB&#8217;s digital business. This ultimately led to the spinoff of its streaming technology platform, BAMTech Media, which he helped found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246547" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246547" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2246547" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?w=411" alt="" width="300" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=104,150 104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=208,300 208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246547" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Images </p></div></p>
<p>While not necessarily a household name, the BAMTech platform has powered big names in streaming, including HBO Now, WWE Network, Eurosport Player, Fox Sports, and the NHL.</p>
<p>At Sirius XM, the exec will be tasked with helping oversee the company&#8217;s Information Technology and Broadcast Infrasture and the team that builds and operates those platforms. In total, he will lead a team of 1,500+ engineers and product professionals across Sirius XM, Pandora, and Stitcher. He will also be in charge of Sirius XM&#8217;s product roadmap, satellite infrastructure, and its overall technology vision and innovation and will report directly to Sirius XM CEO Jennifer Witz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hire is a big win for Sirius XM which has been struggling to compete with Spotify and others in terms of consumer interest. Though the company delivered on its last earnings, its stock <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/sirius-xm-performed-investors-earnings/">has lost 3% of its value</a> over the last five years vs a 120% gain in Spotify during the same time, for example. In its most <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/">recent quarter,</a> Sirius XM reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9% to reach $2.2 billion in its third quarter and a record 616,000 net new self-pay Sirius XM subscribers to its satellite radio business. At the end of Q3, Sirius XM had 34.1 million total subscribers, down from 34.3 million in the same quarter last year, but projected that by Q4, this year will be its biggest yet on subscriber growth since 2018.</p>
<p>Still, much of Sirius XM&#8217;s business is reliant on automaker partnerships and preinstalls, and catered to a workforce that spent a lot of time commuting to and from the office. The pandemic has reshaped how people work &#8212; now often from home &#8212; and autos come equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrations that allow customers to easily use their own preferred streaming apps. Combined, these factors could make satellite radio a harder sell long-term, as its cross-platform experience &#8212; particularly on the mobile app side &#8212; is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s 2018<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/"> $3.5 billion acquisition</a> of Pandora hasn&#8217;t gone that well, either. The streaming app continues to lose traction with consumers, <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/">dropping</a> to 52.6 million monthly active users in Q3 down from 55.1 million in Q2 and 58.6 million a year ago. Meanwhile, Sirius XM has invested in podcasting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">another for Simplecast</a> for analytics and distribution tools. And it&#8217;s pursued other initiatives to try to connect with consumers, like Pandora&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">new SoundCloud station</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/siriusxm-partners-with-tiktok-on-a-new-music-channel-pandora-playlists-and-more/">TikTok partnership</a>.</p>
<p>Inzerillo&#8217;s hire could shake things up at the company allowing it to better capitalize on the products and services it offers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a long-time listener and huge fan of SiriusXM, and I could not be more excited to join this team,&#8221; said Inzerillo, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-names-joseph-inzerillo-chief-product--technology-officer-301443050.html">statement</a>. &#8220;Streaming and over-the-top offerings have revolutionized the entertainment industry – and audio is no exception. This opportunity is the culmination of all of my professional experiences over the last 30 years, and one I simply could not pass up. From the moment I accepted the role, my mind has been racing with ideas for how we can expand digital capabilities across SiriusXM&#8217;s business. Together, our team will develop a product and technology roadmap that will further differentiate SiriusXM and bring creative new entertainment options to consumers at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>CEO Jennifer Witz also praised Inzerillo&#8217;s 30 years of digital media experience and hinted towards forthcoming product changes in a staff memo, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With Joe’s wide breadth of experience in building and leading innovative digital platforms, I am confident that he will be instrumental in the development and evolution of our growth strategies across our entire suite of products. As a long-time listener, Joe is eager to come on board and work collaboratively with all of the top-notch talent we have at our Company. His excitement about our products and what the future holds is energizing, and I look forward to all that we will accomplish under Joe’s leadership of this expanded Product and Technology organization.</em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart’s had its ups and downs in the robotics world, looking for any advantage in a bid to stay competitive with Amazon’s online domination. In July, the mega-retailer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/walmart-will-be-bringing-symbotic-robots-to-25-distribution-centers/"> inked a deal with Symbotics</a>, further cementing its commitment to the Massachusetts-based automation firm. The new deal expanded a partnership first piloted in 2017 that’s set to bring robotics to 25 regional Walmart distribution centers.</p>
<p>The rollout, which will take “several years” to complete, joins partnerships with Albertsons and C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Symbotic says its current implementation “touch[es] over 1,400 stores in 16 states and 8 Canadian provinces,” likely a reference to those locations directly impacted by distribution centers. The company&#8217;s autonomous robotic systems augment existing warehouse structures. Not surprisingly, the company is also leaning in heavily in the ways in which it can impact on-going supply chain concerns.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.symbotic.com/news/symbotic-to-become-a-public-company-in-partnership-with-softbank">Symbotic announced plans to go public via SPAC</a>, courtesy of a merger with Softbank Investment Advisers’ SVF Investment Corp. 3. The deal gives the company a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion, while raising upwards of $725 million in gross proceeds, including $200 million from Softbank. It also comes on the tail-end of what has been a very fruitful robotic investment year for Softbank.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Now is the time to take Symbotic to the next level,” CEO Rick Cohen said in a release. “SoftBank has tremendous experience investing in leading-edge artificial intelligence and robotics innovators, and our partnership with them will provide us with new insights, relationships and capital that will help us realize our full potential. Together, I’m confident Symbotic will be a powerful, long-term force in modernizing the supply chain to the benefit of all.”</p>
<p>If the deal closes in the first-half of 2022 as expected, Walmart will own 9% of the robotics/A.I. firm. It’s not quite the all-in acquisitions of companies like Kiva Systems that have formed the foundation of Amazon Robotics, but it’s clear now that Walmart has determined commitments to robotic fulfillment centers to be a necessary step toward its future.</p>

<p>Welcome to the final Equity Monday of the year. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian PM&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/indian-prime-minister-modis-twitter-account-was-briefly-compromised/">was hacked</a>, and used to promote bitcoin. Not a great look for the crypto world.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies for possible M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harry’s Labs, the in-house incubator started by razor brand <a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Inc.</a>, announced Monday it agreed to acquire <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumē</a>, the direct-to-consumer brand created to help control all-over body odor.</p>
<p>Harry’s created the innovation group in 2018 that has backed or launched several consumer product companies, including cat products startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/backed-by-harrys-labs-cat-person-launches-its-lineup-of-cat-care-products/">Cat Person</a>, body care line Flamingo and hair care line Headquarters.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows Harry’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2021/03/31/exclusive-harrys-raises-a-155-million-series-e--at-17-billion-a-year-after-the-ftc-blocked-its-billion-dollar-sale-to-edgewell/?sh=5cbd3dcb9759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 million Series E round of funding</a> that gave the company a $1.7 billion valuation and over $650 million in total funding raised since it was founded in 2013. Harry&#8217;s itself was at one time in the position of being acquired. In May 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">Edgewell Personal Care announced it intended to buy Harry’s</a>, but in February 2020, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">filed a lawsuit to block the deal</a> from happening, citing how the deal would limit competition and innovation in the razor market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tehmina Haider, Harry’s chief growth officer, told TechCrunch that financial transactions were not disclosed, but that when the company thinks about a business it will acquire, it is looking for demonstrated product fit and consumer love in the market.</p>
<p>“The idea about M&amp;A for Harry’s is we want to be a multi-category CPG company and build a family of CPG brands,” she said. “We want to create more and better things for consumers, and we are looking for brands aligned with that mission, are positioned in a way we can be helpful and are brands serving unmet needs.”</p>
<p>Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Haider said Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies, and “Lumē checks every one of those boxes, which makes it exciting.”</p>
<p>The company was created by Dr. Shannon Klingman, a board-certified OB-GYN, in 2017 to develop a line of aluminum-free deodorants to help patients dealing with below-the-belt body odor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klingman told TechCrunch that unlike other products claiming to inhibit bacterial growth, Lumē is “the only brand on the market clinically tested to block the ability for bacteria to consume fluids like sweat, semen, urine, and blood that lead to odor.”</p>
<p>Lumē, which was bootstrapped since its founding, is part of the <a href="https://drugstorenews.com/keeping-deodorant-category-fresh-key-driving-sales-profits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.2 billion all-purpose deodorant market</a>, and over the next year, Harry’s Labs will work with Klingman, who is staying on with Lumē, to scale the business and accelerate D2C growth. In addition, the entire Lumē team will stay on.</p>
<p>“As soon as I met them, I could see we were aligned,” Klingman said. “As a self-funded brand, you can reach capacity to front-load inventory, but Harry’s has the track record to help us do that. I love that they were interested in Lumē for all of the good things and saw the value of what I am building.”</p>
<p>Haider expects the acquisition to close by the end of this year.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghuravinutala/">Raghu Ravinutala</a> is CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.yellow.ai/">Yellow.ai</a>, a platform that brings AI and human intelligence together to automate customer experience for large brands and enterprises.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If given a choice between being on hold with customer service and having a query resolved by a few taps of a smartphone keyboard, most of us would pick the second option. It’s easy, quick and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-12-gartner-predicts-80--of-customer-service-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gartner</a>, 80% of companies will switch from native mobile applications to messaging by 2025.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, many of the chatbots we encounter on a daily basis just don’t cut it. They lag, misunderstand simple questions and above all, don’t meet the standard of intuitive design that consumers expect.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the chatbot industry hasn’t evolved since its conception. We’ve come a long way from the clunky, barely functional chatbots of the late &#8217;90s and early aughts. However, there’s room for improvement and innovation. The missing pillar? Conversational UX.</p>
<h2>What is conversational UX?</h2>
<p>Conversational UX has largely been ignored in the bot-building process. It’s an entirely new paradigm in this space, but it’s not a new hurdle altogether. Every new advancement in tech is accompanied by a discussion on how humans can interact with the the tech for better results. Technologists aren’t just tasked with making sure the products work, they must also devise ways to make the experience functional.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Conversational UX is an emerging field, but despite the need for more intuitive chatbots, the industry as a whole is not spending the necessary time and effort into perfecting the experience.</p>
<p>Chatbots often function as glorified web forms, without any of the intuition or seamless integrations that consumers expect to see when interacting with “smart” platforms. But the industry has improved dramatically in recent years: Modern chatbot platforms have hundreds of pre-built integrations, which enable companies to connect their existing systems and tools to provide a secure, unified customer experience.</p>
<p>With every new interface, the goal is to make human-machine interactions better and result in a more intuitive experience for the user. Conversational UX presents a greater challenge because of the nuances involved with human language. It requires careful thought, empathy for the user and significant design considerations to carefully craft elegant experiences.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a few ways we can make the experience better for the average end user.</p>
<h2>Omnichannel capabilities</h2>
<p>According to a recent study, the average American household has <a href="https://www.itpro.com/mobile/mobile-phones/359826/smart-devices-more-than-doubled-in-us-homes-amid-covid-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 connected devices</a>, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets and laptops. This means we’re more connected than ever, with endless opportunities for companies to engage with their customers. But often, chatbots are fragmented across different touch points and can&#8217;t carry the historical data of past interactions with customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A not-for-profit set up by a former Uber driver who successfully challenged the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s misclassification of drivers&#8217; employment status in the UK, has published a timely <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots">report</a> pressing the case for proper oversight of the algorithms and data used to remotely surveil and control the labor of platform workers.</p>
<p>Timely &#8212; given the European Union has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">proposed legislation</a> to enhance algorithm transparency on digital labor platforms as a lever to tackle problematic working conditions.</p>

<p>At the same time, lawmakers in the UK &#8212; which now sits outside the bloc &#8212; are consulting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">lowering domestic data protection standards</a>. Including, potentially, stripping out existing rights associated with automated decision-making; and removing the requirement to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to processing sensitive personal data &#8212; which the not-for-profit warns would amount to &#8220;a hammer-blow for precarious workers who already have long been denied basic employment rights who could now be robbed of the means to hold rogue employers to proper account&#8221;, as the report puts it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots">report</a>, co-authored by researcher Cansu Safak and former Uber driver James Farrer, who founded the <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/">Worker Information Exchange</a> (WIF), is entitled <em>Managed by Bots: Data-Driven Exploitation in the Gig Economy.</em></p>
<p>It contains a number of case studies which illustrate the obstacles and obfuscation faced by regional gig workers seeking to obtain data access rights to try to assess the fairness of platforms&#8217; data-driven decisions about them and their labor (up to and including termination of their ability to work on the platform).</p>
<p>Examples discussed include &#8216;antifraud&#8217; facial recognition checks that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/uber-faces-legal-action-over-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-id-checks/">appear racially biased</a>; drivers notified of fraud strikes on their accounts without being given clear, immediate information about what is triggering warnings that can also lead to account termination; and numerous instances of drivers not being provided with all their requested data while platforms work hard to frustrate their requests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WIF&#8217;s report goes on to argue that &#8220;woefully inadequate levels of transparency about the extent of algorithmic management and automated decision making&#8221; is enabling exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>Litigation is one (extant) route for regional gig workers to try to obtain their rights &#8212; including employment protections and data rights &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen plenty of both already in Europe.</p>
<p>Most notably, Farrer&#8217;s own employment classification litigation against Uber which forced the platform to finally recognize UK drivers as workers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>However Uber&#8217;s self-serving interpretation still avoids paying drivers for the time they spend waiting for the next trip. (Aka: &#8220;Failure to pay for waiting time as working time enables platforms to take advantage of the immediacy of availability to drive up customer response time while driving down worker earnings,&#8221; as the report neatly sumarizes it.)</p>
<p>While &#8212; even in the UK &#8212; such workers are not protected against instant dismissal by (unfair) algorithm.</p>
<p>So the report makes the point that worker status is not itself a panacea against opaque algorithmic management &#8212; with the co-authors warning that &#8220;the recent gains in the courts do not fully protect workers against its harms&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/embed/#?secret=1sT9Ee9t8s" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WIF is also supporting a number of challenges to gig platforms&#8217; algorithmic control of workers, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">we&#8217;ve</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">reported</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">before</a> &#8212; but that&#8217;s also an expensive and time-consuming process for precarious workers who typically lack resources to fight platform giants through the courts.</p>
<p>So its overarching point is that current protections for individuals subject to algorithmic decision-making, such as those contained in Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, do not go far enough &#8212; allowing platforms to concoct convoluted justifications for withholding the workings of algorithms from those subject to opaque management and control by AI.</p>
<p>Here the report calls out platforms&#8217; conflation of fraud management with performance management, as one example.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that such ‘fraud’ indicators are used as variables for work allocation and that the behaviours generating them are allowed to continue on the platform demonstrates that these are not instances of criminal fraud, but mechanisms of control, which assess how well workers are performing against the opaque metrics set by companies,&#8221; the report notes in a section subtitled &#8220;Surveillance Arms Race&#8221; &#8212; which discusses a variety of systems used by ride-hailing platforms Uber, Bolt and Free Now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suggest that any ‘fraud’ terminology used in these contexts also function as part of the misclassification game, designed to conceal the employment relationship,&#8221; it adds, further arguing there has been &#8220;widespread proliferation and a disproportionate use of worker surveillance in the name of fraud prevention'&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report makes the case for increased digital rights protections to steer the industry in a better direction &#8212; allowing gig workers to gain &#8220;equality in digitally mediated work&#8221; vs today&#8217;s abuse-enabling power imbalance where platforms pull all the strings, and deploy denial and/or dark patterns to frustrate workers&#8217; attempts to leverage existing (weak) legal protections.</p>
<p>Categories of data that platforms process about workers &#8212; which WIF&#8217;s report notes are typically made explicit in platform <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/uber-guidance-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance documents</a> and <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/ola-guidance-document)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policies</a> &#8212; are often not shared with drivers when they download their data or make subject access requests under GDPR, underlining the discrepancy between existing levels of data processing by platforms vs transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our experience, when workers seek out this information, gig platforms aim to make the process difficult and burdensome by engaging in a variety of non-compliant behaviour,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Workers seeking comprehensive data have to navigate exceedingly complex and obstructive website architectures and need to circumvent further frustration efforts by support agents, who unnecessarily prolong simple administrative processes or provide automated responses that fail to adequately answer queries.</p>
<p>&#8220;These procedures can be described as ‘dark patterns’ designed to guide workers away from exercising their rights as data subjects. On the occasions where workers are able to obtain their data, it is often either missing considerable segments or presented in inconsistent and non-machine readable formats, making analysis effectively impossible. These acts of obstruction force workers to make repeated requests which companies ultimately use as a reason for discrediting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of the DSAR [data subject access request] returns we have seen, no employer has given a full and proper account of automated personal data processing,&#8221; the report adds. &#8220;This is particularly important in areas that can determine security of employment such as work allocation, performance management, safety and security, as discussed through this report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, platforms have sought to shield their algorithms from litigation seeking data on the AIs&#8217; logic, inputs and outputs by claiming the &#8220;safety and security&#8221; of their services could be compromised if such information was disclosed to workers.</p>
<p>(And &#8212; in London at least &#8212; platforms such as Uber appear to have been pushed toward even tighter algorithmic surveillance of drivers (and use of flawed facial recognition technology) as a result of a safety-focused intervention by the transport regulator, TfL, which has, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">since 2017</a>, has denied Uber a full licence to operate, citing safety concerns&#8230; )</p>
<p>But the report argues it&#8217;s the opposite that&#8217;s true, writing: &#8220;In our view, safety and security can only be enhanced when platforms transparently set rules and performance standards rather than relying on covert surveillance and summary dismissals, which are some of the key motivators of DSARs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the report&#8217;s lead author, Safak, added: “The many worker cases we document in this report make it undeniably clear that the harms of algorithmic management are real and affect the most vulnerable. Gig platforms are collecting an unprecedented amount of data from workers through invasive surveillance technologies. Every day, companies make allegations of ‘algorithmic wrongdoing’ which they do not offer any evidence for. They block and frustrate workers’ efforts to obtain their personal data when they try to defend themselves. This is how gig platforms maintain exploitative power.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Farrer said: “As gig economy platforms mature and regulatory pressure builds, we are seeing employers roll out intensive surveillance and opaque automated management decision making systems to exercise ever more hidden forms of control over workers. This report shows how the latest wave of employment misclassification tactics involves employers telling workers they are truly independent in their jobs while at the same time management control is wielded as forcefully as ever but from behind the digital curtain.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">WIF, along with the digital rights campaign group Privacy International and the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union is seeking to raise public awareness over the issue as regional lawmakers consider their next steps &#8212; launching a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/managed-by-bots">public campaign</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://action.privacyinternational.org/campaign/24">petition</a> that calls<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for greater algorithmic transparency and accountability from platform employers.</span></p>
<p>As part of the petition the groups say they will be writing to a number of gig platforms &#8212; including Uber, Just Eat, Amazon Flex, Free Now, Bolt, Ola and Deliveroo &#8212; to &#8220;demand answers&#8221; and &#8220;ensure that the unprecedented surveillance that gig-economy workers are facing from their employers ends&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As they near the end of a blockbuster year for NFTs that saw more than $10 billion in transaction volume, today&#8217;s NFT project developers are finding themselves facing a dilemma &#8212; whether to chase today&#8217;s dollars or tomorrow&#8217;s users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, maker of one of the year&#8217;s more mainstream breakout NFT hits NBA Top Shot, has been looking to convince investors that it can court developers to bet on the latter. Today, the startup recently valued at $7.6 billion is showcasing some of the fruits of this pursuit, debuting the product of its partnership with avatars-for-the-stars startup <a href="https://genies.com/">Genies</a> &#8212; an ambitious NFT storefront which the startups hope will serve as a hub for Web3 digital identity allowing users to create animated avatars and outfit them with crypto accessories.</p>
<p>The new platform, called <em>The Warehouse</em>, is launching today to a small network of invite-only users before gradually out to a wider audience in the coming months, both startups tell TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new platform will allow users to outfit 3D cartoon avatars that they create inside the Genies app with masks, shoes, backpacks and other digital accessories minted on Dapper&#8217;s blockchain network called Flow. Genies tells us that the majority of items in the store will be sold for less than $20, though that&#8217;s notably just for primary sales, owners of those goods will decide the market for secondary sales of individual items. <em>The Warehouse</em> notably won&#8217;t have its secondary marketplace enabled at launch, an effort the Genies team hopes will give the community some time to focus on the product rather than resale values.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246423" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246423" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246423 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/drops-summary-page-3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246423" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Genies</p></div></p>
<p>Genies has notably already experimented with selling digital apparel and accessories inside its native mobile app, though that venture did not include a blockchain or NFT-related element. Genies foray into NFT economics is a bet on Dapper&#8217;s particular brand of blockchain, one that may be less decentralized than networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but one which offers a number of baked-in user benefits including lower fees, higher transaction capacity and a developer platform that&#8217;s friendly to Web3 &#8220;luxuries&#8221; like processing credit cards and users forgetting their passwords.</p>
<p>Flow is certainly not the only bet on a more consumer-friendly blockchain with lower fees and friendlier onboarding, though Dapper has raised some $600 million from investors on the promise of its future success. Competing Layer 1 chains like Wax and Solana have seen more action from native NFT projects in recent months as developers aim to tap into the platform&#8217;s strengths and the wallets of coin holders. Venture investors have also minted several new crypto unicorns this year that are aiming to scale the Ethereum blockchain with &#8220;rollup&#8221; products that allow developers to leverage the network&#8217;s security while processing and bundling transactions on a secondary chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>NBA Top Shot&#8217;s meteoric rise earlier this year brought a lot of attention to Dapper which saw monthly transaction volume go from under $1 million in December 2020 to nearly $225 million in February 2021. These days, Top Shot&#8217;s network of buyers and transactions sits far below those of its most notable competitor Axie Infinity which had over 520,00 unique buyers in November compared to Top Shot&#8217;s 64,000 according to crypto analytics site <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">CryptoSlam</a>. While the broader NFT market has exploded in value since Top Shot kickstarted the party, the vast majority of new high-traffic projects have embraced Ethereum, aiming to tap into the hundreds of billions of liquid crypto wealth flowing through that network.</p>

<p>The launch of <em>The Warehouse</em> is a particularly big moment for Dapper, as it looks to court developers and catch fire again while learning from its mistakes with Top Shot, which struggled early-on to keep up with a scaling audience and has frustrated some early adopters who have seen the value of their NFTs sink as Dapper has continued issuing more and more NFT Moments.</p>
<p>“The Genies Warehouse is the biggest release on Flow since NBA Top Shot and we’re looking forward to a similar success,” Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Genies is far from a household name today, the startup&#8217;s high-profile partners most definitely are. For years avatar startups have been popping up hoping to capture a piece of the &#8220;digital identity&#8221; pie, but game makers have been uninterested in adopting third-party systems and celebrities have been too busy dissecting social media influence to bother thinking about virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Genies has been more successful than any startup in recent memory at building out a network of celebrity partnerships for a product that has a decidedly niche vision of the future of the web, albeit one increasingly shared by investors as the startup has more fervently embraced NFTs publicly this year. Last week, Genies announced a partnership with Universal Music Group to host avatars and digital goods from the group&#8217;s roster of recording artists. Genies has already enjoyed partnerships with the who&#8217;s who of entertainers including figures like Justin Bieber, J Balvin and Cardi B.</p>
<p>In May, Genies scored the endorsement of Mary Meeker&#8217;s venture fund Bond which bankrolled the startup&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/avatar-startup-genies-scores-65-million-in-funding-round-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/"> $65 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>While NFTs have enjoyed a fair weather embrace by the tech industry and venture investor class, there seems to be plenty of evidence that consumers are still skeptical of how expensive digital items that look identical to the ones they&#8217;ve bought inside games for years are supposed to revolutionize their online experience.</p>
<p>Last month, chat app Discord found itself at the receiving end of a wide user backlash after CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot of an integration with NFT wallet platform MetaMask. After thousands of replies poured in, many of them critical, Citron followed up with a <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20">tweet</a> clarifying that it was merely an &#8220;internal concept&#8221; the the company had &#8220;no current plans to ship&#8221; and that &#8220;Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Dapper and Genies are aiming to cut through some of the NFT industry&#8217;s baggage with <em>The Warehouse&#8217;s</em> debut.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an avatar 10K profile picture project or us bringing culture to NFTs and crypto,&#8221; notes Genies CEO Akash Nigam. &#8220;We see this as the first step in creating a digital identity across the metaverse for consumers and plan to give the wearable creation tools to consumers and talent down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/german-bionic-raises-20m-led-by-samsung-for-exoskeleton-tech-to-supercharge-human-labor/">German Bionic announced a $20 million Series A round led</a> &#8212; in part &#8212; by Samsung Catalyst Fund. It was a curious alliance, given that Samsung has shown off its own robotic exoskeleton technology. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/taking-a-stroll-with-samsungs-robotic-exoskeleton/">I took Samsung&#8217;s Gait Enhancing and Motivation System out for a spin</a> a few CESes ago &#8212; and while it was limited in functionality, it worked well for walking assistance.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s never entirely clear just how seriously we’re meant to take Samsung’s robotic ambitions. Thus far, the company’s offerings seem largely for show. German Bionic, on the other hand, has been at this for a while. In fact, the company just announced the fifth generation of its robotics exoskeleton, Cray X &#8212; which, fittingly, will be on display at next year’s CES in a few short weeks (<em>shudder</em>).</p>
<p>The system is set to debut early next year, available as a hardware-as-a-service subscription model, with a starting price of $499 a month Put simply, you’re probably not going to rent one of these things to move furniture around the house.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2246197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246197" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> German Bionic</p></div></p>
<p>The new system is capable of supporting up to 66 additional pounds per lift. It also adds walking assistance to the mix. That’s a first for the Cray X line &#8212; and a combination of support that is generally split between separate devices. The company notes, “It works by gently pushing the legs forward when loads need to be moved from a to b. It thereby helps reduce premature exhaustion and preserve the energy levels of workers conducting tasks involving both lifting and walking.”</p>
<p>The new model is IP54 water/dust resistant and features a new hot swappable battery for continued support. German Bionic is hardly alone in the space. A wide range of companies big and small are working to blur the line between human and robotic workers by offering mechanical assistance for physically demanding manual labor. The company does have a nice base of support, however, with clients including Ikea and BMW.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mozilla Foundation today released its <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/annualreport/2020/">financial report for 2020</a>. As usual, this gives us a good picture of the organization&#8217;s financial health from a year ago, but for the first time this year, Mozilla also provided us with more recent data.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Mozilla recently went through a number of difficult years, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/">major</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/mozilla-lays-off-250/">layoffs</a> in 2020 as it restructured its for-profit arm, Mozilla Corporation. Its flagship Firefox browser, despite a number of technical advances, is also struggling in a marketplace that is now dominated by Chromium-based browsers. Still, in 2020, Mozilla Corporation&#8217;s revenue was $466 million from its search partnerships (largely driven by its search deal with Google), subscriptions and advertising revenue. That&#8217;s essentially the same <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2019/#angela-roxi-letter">as in 2019</a>, when Mozilla Corporation generated $465 million from these sources.</p>
<p>For 2021, the organization forecasts revenue of over $500 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246451" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISYtFzMXVbM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe most important, though, is that Mozilla&#8217;s new products like its Mozilla VPN service, Firefox Relay Premium, Pocket and other commercial initiatives are slowly but surely starting to pay off.  As Mozilla executive VP Angela Plohman and CFO Eric Muhlheim noted in today&#8217;s announcement, revenue from new product offerings will grow 150% this year and account for 14% of the organization&#8217;s revenue in 2021. The Mozilla VPN service saw a revenue increase of 450% from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Still, in 2020, 86% of Mozilla&#8217;s revenue in 2020 came from its search deal with Google. That may be down from 88% in 2019, but for all intents and purposes, Mozilla remains fully dependent on Google for the time being.</p>
<p>Diversifying its revenue sources is really the only way for Mozilla to decrease its reliance on a search deal with a company that is both a competitor, thanks to its dominant Chrome browser, and is increasingly <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/google-privacy-budget-analysis/">out of alignment</a> with Mozilla&#8217;s overall philosophy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As advertising changes and the future of the web’s business model hangs in the balance, we have been exploring new and responsible ways to monetize that align with our values and set us apart,&#8221; Mitchell Baker, CEO and chairwoman of Mozilla Foundation, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We’ve long believed the deprecation of cookies and a reckoning of the online advertising ecosystem was coming — and was much needed. Now it is here, and we are positioned to navigate the industry toward a new model of responsible advertising that respects people while delivering value to companies. By building products for the future, we are building a business for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, what Mozilla needs is for more users to adopt (or come back to) its services, whether that&#8217;s its browser or its VPN. There is a window here for a non-Chrome browser, with users increasingly skeptical about Google&#8217;s motivations and Microsoft&#8217;s Edge team making <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/7-reasons-to-stop-using-microsoft-edge-03701116/">a few missteps</a> in recent months. Yet at the same time, Mozilla&#8217;s efforts to bring sponsored suggestions and ads to Firefox haven&#8217;t necessarily endeared the organization <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/jybx2w/uh_why_is_firefox_showing_me_sponsored_links_in/">to its own users</a> either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Manish Maheshwari, the former head of Twitter India who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitter-india-head-moves-to-a-different-role/amp/">recently moved to San Francisco</a> to work at a different division within the company, is leaving the firm to launch an edtech startup, according to nine people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Maheshwari and Twitter didn’t respond to a request for comment two weeks ago. Sources requested anonymity as the details are private.</p>
<p>Maheshwari has engaged with a handful of investors in recent weeks to raise funds for a new Bangalore-headquartered edtech startup that promises to deliver MBA courses in four months, according to some of the investors to whom he has pitched the new startup. Maheshwari&#8217;s Bangalore home is registered as the new startup&#8217;s office location, according to filings with the local regulator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244928" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The former Twitter India head moved to the U.S. as Senior Director, Revenue Strategy and Operations with focus on &#8216;New Market Entry&#8217; in August this year. His departure from India came at a time when he as well as Twitter were facing unprecedented heat in the South Asian market from New Delhi. Maheshwari was personally named in police cases in at least two Indian states — Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh — earlier this year over complaints that Twitter was allegedly hurting sentiments of people in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more enterprises sign on to the trend of digital transformation and bringing more of their legacy work into the modern era of work, a company called <a href="https://www.snaplogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapLogic</a>, which has built a platform to integrate those apps and data, and to automate some of the activities that use them, has raised a big round of growth funding. The company has raised $165 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its product &#8212; specifically the AI that underpins how it platform works &#8212; and for business development.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that the funding was made at a $1 billion valuation. Sixth Street Growth led the round, and it isn&#8217;t disclosing other investors. Previous backers include Arrowroot Capital (which led a previous $72 million round), Golub Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Vitruvian (which also led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/snaplogic-snaps-up-another-40-million/">previous round</a>), Capital One, Ignition Partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/10/snaplogic-raises-37-5-million-to-help-legacy-data-play-nicely-in-the-cloud/">Microsoft</a> and a number of others. The company has now raised $373 million to date.</p>
<p>The new valuation is a big hike for San Mateo-based SnapLogic, which had an estimated valuation of just over $300 million in 2019 when it last raised money (based on <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/51376-87/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook estimates</a>).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s no surprise, however, when you consider the area of the market it&#8217;s playing in, its customer base, and size. It caters to larger businesses that rely heavily on data services already, IT and tech giants and other major enterprises that include Adobe, Aramark, Drax, Emirates, Qualtrics, Magellan Health, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Workday &#8212; &#8220;thousands&#8221; of organizations in all, it says, in total processing some 2.7 trillion customer documents monthly across some 3.1 million &#8220;pipelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competing against the likes of Workato (which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005023/en/Workato-Announces-110M-at-1.7B-Valuation-to-Transform-How-Enterprises-Work-with-Integration-Led-Automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money</a> earlier this year), Tray.io, Mulesoft and others, SnapLogic originally made its name initially as a company that helped businesses bring together and use data across disparate apps &#8212; an area that proved to be incredibly compelling for enterprises that had adopted a number of applications and architectures across multiple clouds, containers, data warehouses, and on-premise data centers over the years; and were now sitting on a trove of data across all of these that they needed to figure out how to balance and use in better ways.</p>
<p>That has more recently given over to a big push for automation, the logic being that AI and other tools can actually do some of the more mundane and repetitive work using those applications and data once they have been brought together on a single platform. Indeed, SnapLogic today provides not just the tech to integrate and manage apps and data from one place, but also a range of automation features that can be applied to those assets.</p>
<p>Indeed, providing both integration and automation from a single platform &#8212; and thus making procurement easier and costs presumably more competitive &#8212; has been one of the drivers of growth for SnapLogic, the company says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The enterprise automation market is booming, and our latest funding is further validation of our growing momentum and product leadership in that space,” said Gaurav Dhillon, CEO of SnapLogic, in a statement. “Unlike point-to-point players, our focus on the enterprise will unlock the power of applications, data, and APIs. In the post-pandemic era, our customers will use AI and automation to revolutionize their hybrid workforces. With SnapLogic, hybrid- and multi-cloud enterprises can ensure their massive investments in public and private clouds, SaaS, cloud data warehousing, and APIs will pay off.”</p>
<p>However, this area of IT is not a guaranteed homerun. The chief revenue officer of Salesforce, which owns Mulesoft, admitted recently that the company was going through a &#8220;rough patch&#8221; partly due to staff turnover, and partly due to slowing sales growth. That could partly be a result of competition, but partly also that the rush of companies into big IT digital transformation projects may be entering a slightly less exuberant, more practical bedding-in period.</p>
<p>Investors are not deterred by this when assessing the bigger opportunity and what they see as underlying trends that will keep companies like SnapLogic growing their business.</p>
<p>“Modern enterprises are democratizing access to data and applications and empowering business teams to use low-code, self-service technologies to build the solutions they need to work better and faster,” said Michael McGinn, partner and co-head of Sixth Street Growth, in a statement. “SnapLogic’s seasoned management team, sound economic model, and sustainable growth plan put it in a great position to capitalize on the thriving enterprise automation sector and expanding hybrid workplace trends. We are pleased to lead this funding round and partner with SnapLogic to bring its market vision, unmatched platform, and robust partnerships to more enterprises around the world.”</p>
<p>Sixth Street is an interesting backer to have leading this round for SnapLogic. The firm has backed a number of scaled-up startups that have gone on to go public or seen big acquisition moves such as Airbnb, MDLIVE, Spotify, and Sprinklr. That raises the question of what SnapLogic might be considering for its longer-term future. We&#8217;ll hopefully be talking to Dhillon later and will update this post as and when we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thirdweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirdweb</a>, a software startup for web3 projects, closed on $5 million in funding from a group of high-profile business leaders, entrepreneurs and creators, including Gary Vaynerchuk and Mark Cuban.</p>
<p>The company launched its free tools three months ago for developers to build, launch and manage their web3 projects without writing any lines of code. Thirdweb was created by Social Chain founder Steven Bartlett and Furquan Rydhan, who was founding CTO of Bebo and AppLovin.</p>
<p>Thirdweb, with offices in London and San Francisco, enables the addition of features, including NFTs, social tokens and currencies, marketplaces for buying and selling tokens and NFT loot boxes and drops, in a few clicks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Bartlett told TechCrunch that he had been intrigued by web3 and cryptocurrency and followed the space for over four years. When Bartlett met Rydhan, who said he was an early investor in crypto, they clicked over web3.</p>
<p>“We knew that builders would want to build in this space and that they would need a tool,” Rydhan said. “We started with a base set of ideas, and over the course of a year, built out Thirdweb and now have hundreds of customers integrating SDKs. Like the way Stripe made it easy to plug in, our code is similar, but we wrote it to give to everyone.”</p>
<p>They’ve been working with the early adopters on features, some of whom have been using Thirdweb for over a year. They also say companies like Nike, Disney, Bumble and Meta are already itching to begin building apps and products, like blockchain games, NFT platforms, DAOs and creator projects, for the metaverse, web3 and NFT spaces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it’s still early, the company just crossed over its 500th unique project built using its tools. Some of the immediate use cases have been with art, but now Bartlett and Rydhan are seeing more complex web3 apps being built and gated communities that want to create a space.</p>
<p>Thirdweb’s goal is to get to over 1,000 developers, teams and companies using the tools, and Rydhan said the company is “well on our way to doing that.”</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to hire both on the technical and growth teams and will focus on marketing and video assets to educate users on its tools. Thirdweb will continue to be free to use until royalties and fees are programmed into the sales of NFTs that are launched. At that time, the company will take 5% of the royalties of secondary sales, which means the company’s compensation is in direct proportion to the success of its customers, the co-founders said.</p>
<p>Web3 is happening and NFTs are here for the rest of our collective lives,&#8221; Vaynerchuk said via email. &#8220;Look at what happened from 1995 to 2000 on the &#8216;internet&#8217; and use that history lesson to deploy how much will be &#8216;fixed&#8217; in web3 over the next half decade. I’m excited to see Thirdweb accelerate this shift. Fifteen years ago, no one believed that the world would be full of social media creators and artists. Web3 is now giving them the opportunity to own their creations and get a fair share of the profits, and I think that’s something you don’t want to miss. I believe in this space, I believe in this team, I believe in their vision, I believe in the opportunity and I believe in their execution.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is developing a free, open source infrastructure for building and scaling real-time audio and video experiences in applications. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the global pandemic hit, Russell d’Sa was running product at Medium and recognized early on that with everyone working from home, the company’s culture was impacted, affecting a lot of the interaction between employees.</p>
<p>“What disappeared was the collegial conversations, the drinks on Friday evenings or making coffee together,” he told TechCrunch. “So much about becoming friends at work underpins how you ultimately collaborate.”</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse was launched</a> in its alpha form last year, it was discussed as being a new form of participatory media “that would change everything,” d’Sa said, and he wanted something like that for his work colleagues.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He dug into how the app was being powered by Agora and began developing a desktop app for his idea. He launched it and almost immediately accrued a 1,300-company waitlist. D’Sa ultimately shelved the app, but found that companies were “desperate in this new environment to try anything.”</p>
<p>In fact, one large social media company approached him about using his app for its 1,000-person company, but was concerned about security using Agora. He began looking at alternatives, but found that many were focused on conferencing and didn’t provide for the flexibility for native mobile.</p>
<p>That’s how <a href="https://livekit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveKit</a> was born. D’Sa and his team, which includes co-founder David Zhao, developed a free, open source infrastructure for building and scaling real-time audio and video experiences, aka WebRTC, in applications.</p>
<p>It launched in July, and today the company announced $7 million in seed funding that includes backing from Redpoint Ventures and a group of individual investors, including Justin Kan, Robin Chan and Elad Gil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Only five months old, the tool did trend on GitHub, going from zero to almost 2,000 stars, d’Sa said. It is also proving product market fit, especially as more talk revolved around the metaverse.</p>
<p>“COVID changed the world to where we are living online, even going to weddings over the internet,” he added. “We are already living in the metaverse and have been for over two years.”</p>
<p>He believes the conference call is not the future and that virtual and augmented reality will make calls feel more like real life. However, the challenge is how to move the data around quickly over the internet and have an infrastructure that works for cameras, microphones and 3D objects.</p>
<p>Initial use cases for LiveKit’s live audio and video experiences have been cameras at events, but a drone company is even using the technology. As the company saw more adoption, including over 100 projects utilizing LiveKit, d’Sa decided to go after venture capital backing to scale the team, which grew from three to 15 since the launch.</p>
<p>The company isn’t generating revenue right now, but they will be as new tools come online, like services offered beyond the baseline features, including analytics, telemetry, spam and abuse monitoring, transcription, translations or voice and face features.</p>
<p>Next up, the LiveKit team will be focused on technology development so the tools are more reliable, flexible and accessible to developers and the kinds of use cases they are building.</p>
<p>“The goal is to figure out a way to work, even with a bad network,” d’Sa said. “We talk to companies big and small, and the largest companies want massive scale to make million-person events all interactive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indonesia-based insurtech startup <a href="https://www.fuse.co.id/en/home-en/">Fuse</a> announced today it has secured $25 million of Series B extension round as it plans to enter more countries including Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia. The startup has closed three funding rounds of Series B within the past six months, bringing the company&#8217;s total raised to over $70 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital was led by an undisclosed global fintech fund with participation from existing investors East Ventures, GGV Capital, eWTP and Emtek. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Launched in 2017, Fuse connects insurance companies with multiple distribution channels and partners to make insurance services accessible and affordable through its technology. Fuse uses mobile applications to offer an agent-focused service, B2A (Business to Agent/ Broker). Fuse Pro app enables agents and broker partners to maximize choices for their customers. The startup also has B2C and B2B2C (micro insurance and financial institute), which provides digital small-ticket size insurance products, distributing insurance products cost-effectively to end customers by partnerships with e-commerce channels like Tokopedia.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246437" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Southeast Asia’s rapidly growing digitally savvy middle class that is expected to grow to 350 million consumers with $300 billion in disposable income makes the region an attractive market for insurtech companies. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in the insurance industry, one of the most conservative sectors. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse plans to tap into the huge and underpenetrated insurance industry in other countries in Southeast Asia, where </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economysea.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">more than 70 percent of Southeast Asia&#8217;s population</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is connected to the internet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We deeply believe that digital insurance transformation can help more people get protection with insurance, and hopefully, the insurance penetration rate can increase substantially in the coming years in Indonesia as well as Southeast Asia,” said Andy Yeung, CEO of Fuse.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse claims it currently has more than 60,000 marketers or agent partners using the Fuse Pro mobile app. More than 40 insurance companies, including general and life insurance companies, use Fuse’s platform to offer over 300 insurance products for partners or end customers. The company has exceeded $70 million in gross written premium (GWP) for the first three quarters of 2021. The company said it has the largest GWP in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has over 460 employees, with branch offices in Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are very glad to be recognized by a leading global fintech fund which had looked into most insurtech players in Southeast Asia and decided to invest in Fuse. We are very excited to get access and insights from other fintech and insurtech portfolio companies in this global network. The strong interest of global investors reconfirms our current ecosystem approach – using Fuse’s technology platform to make insurance more </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accessible for Southeast Asia’s underpenetrated population,” Yeong said.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SenseTime, one of China&#8217;s most valuable AI solution providers, is putting its $767 million<a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/202112070631111799815632_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> public listing</a> on hold, the company <a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/20211213121601129910049428_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement came three weeks after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange gave the go-ahead to SenseTime&#8217;s IPO. On December 10, the U.S. Department of Treasury added the firm to a list of <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Chinese military-industrial complex Companies,&#8221; </a>saying it &#8220;has developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target’s ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military blacklist bars U.S. investors from purchasing or selling publicly traded securities of SenseTime.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In response to the U.S. government&#8217;s decision, SenseTime is postponing its IPO and will publish a supplementary prospectus with a new listing timetable to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;safeguard the interests&#8221; of its potential investors.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly oppose the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,&#8221; SenseTime said in a statement. &#8220;The accusations are unfounded and reflect a fundamental misperception of our company. We regret to have been caught in the middle of geopolitical tension.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2019, SenseTime was placed on the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> U.S. Entity List</a> that blocked it from doing business with American companies.</p>
