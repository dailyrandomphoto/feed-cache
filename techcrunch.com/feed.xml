					<description><![CDATA[Veho's technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and lets customers know the actual time of delivery and even communicates when the driver is headed their way.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shipveho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veho</a>, a startup applying technology to next-day package delivery, aims to solve the last mile of delivery — how packages get from fulfillment centers to the customer’s door. It also wants to do it with a unique flair: providing transparency into deliveries that starts with the option of when, where and how customers want their packages delivered and then real-time communication throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>Since raising its seed round in the summer of 2020, New York-based Veho has grown 40 times in revenue, while also increasing its employee count from 15 to 400, Veho co-founder and CEO Itamar Zur told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It is already working in 14 U.S. markets, but plans to grow to 50 markets by the end of 2022. To do that, and invest in technology development, growing the team and introducing and scaling its doorstep returns program, the company announced $125 million in Series A funding that valued the company at $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>General Catalyst led the round and was joined by Construct Capital, led by Rachel Holt, Bling Capital, Industry Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and Origin Ventures. The latest funding round gives Veho a total of $130 million raised to date, Zur said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Walmart announces GoLocal, a last-mile delivery service for other retailers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/embed/#?secret=D09le0JrZf" data-secret="D09le0JrZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You might be asking yourself why in the world a young company would take on so much capital up front like that, but Zur responded that Veho is “a substantial platform, not a small operation at this point, and we want to maintain fast growth.”</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity in the midst of the biggest e-commerce revolution, and after growing fast through the pandemic, that is not going away,” he added. “Customer experience is changing in front of our eyes, and other than speed and communication, what brands want to provide is visibility and data. We think it is the perfect time to take in more capital to continue to grow at a phenomenal rate.”</p>
<p>Sure, Amazon has a bear hug on about 50% of the last-mile market, and there is no debate that they are doing well here. Zur doesn’t deny it either, but he does see an opportunity to offer the same kind of delivery service for the 50% of e-commerce businesses that want to offer something faster than seven to 10 business days.</p>
<p>Veho&#8217;s technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and can then let customers know the actual time of day when they will receive their package and even when the driver is headed their way. It is also making it possible to reschedule a delivery in real time, change an address or provide personal delivery instructions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250030" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250030" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg" alt="Veho" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250030" class="wp-caption-text">The Veho team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veho</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea for the company stems from Zur’s own experience. While in business school, he bought a subscription for meal delivery, but his first package never arrived. Zur recalls trying to get in touch with the delivery company, and after waiting for 40 minutes, the call was disconnected. As a result, he canceled the subscription, which is not unlike what other consumers do as they become more intolerant of receiving packages late or not at all.</p>
<p>“In an increasingly competitive e-commerce space, there are tons of companies looking for similarly fast delivery as Amazon, but lack the scale to do it,” Zur said. “Veho levels the playing field for these brands. The biggest missed opportunities are connecting the dots between the pre-packaged experience and delivery to help brands build more loyalty and for people to stay with them longer, to buy more and buy more frequently.”</p>
<p>Veho is not alone in trying to solve the last-mile problem, and is among companies around the world also raising capital for their approaches. For example, in the past six months, we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-bike-subscription-service-zoomo-raises-60m-series-b-to-disrupt-last-mile-delivery/">Zoomo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/last-mile-logistics-platform-cargamos-raises-11m-seed-round-to-expand-same-day-delivery/">Cargamos</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/deliverr-inventory-customers/">Deliverr</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">Bringg</a> announce new rounds. Walmart also introduced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/">Walmart GoLocal program</a> in the summer for other retailers to tap into the retail giant’s delivery network.</p>
<p>Zur doesn’t see Veho competing against the likes of Deliverr or some of those others, but does see the company competing with the national shipping companies. He believes their technology was designed for “an older world” that didn’t include e-commerce, and that is what separates Veho from them — that it was built “entirely around the needs of e-commerce customers” with a vision of how that sector will grow over the next decade.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-9-29-cagr-last-mile-delivery-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-200-42-bn-in-2027--says-brandessence-market-research-301387705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global last-mile delivery market</a> was valued at around $108 billion in 2020 and is set to grow by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/last-mile-delivery-market-grow-143000535.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$146.96 billion in the next four years</a>, with North America contributing to 39% of that growth, according to technology and research company Technavio.</p>
<p>With purchases shifting to e-commerce, the logistics and parcel delivery sectors are racing to keep up with demands. They’ve also been met with major setbacks in the past few years. From the aptly dubbed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/holiday-shipageddon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipaggedon</a>” during the holiday season in 2020, to manufacturing and shipping delays for everything from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/developers-and-designers-can-help-businesses-manage-the-semiconductor-shortage/">semiconductors</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/11/5/22764088/supply-chain-shipping-delays-logistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a ship into the port</a>.</p>
<p>Veho wants to make the delivery experience so awesome that it facilitates trust between the consumer and e-commerce company so that consumers return to order again. Zur notes this is already happening, citing that its customers, which range from selling apparel and accessories to food and packaged goods, saw a 20% increase in customer repurchase, 40% increase in customer lifetime value and an eight-point increase in net promoter score compared to customers who received their box from a traditional shipping company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said there is room for more companies going after an <a href="https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2021/08/03/post-pandemic-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$800 billion e-commerce market</a>, of which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/#:~:text=The%20eCommerce%20market%20encompasses%20the,such%20as%20smartphones%20and%20tablets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">half stems from the U.S</a>., and that is forecasted overall to grow around $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>Like Zur, Doherty had his own frustrations receiving packages at his home in San Francisco, which he said is notorious for <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/san-francisco-2nd-worst-u-s-city-for-package-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having problems with package thefts</a>.</p>
<p>“You feel helpless and that you’ve lost control of the situation,” he added. “We have had a front-row seat to the dramatic acceleration in the use of e-commerce and a stressed supply chain. We had a belief that computer technology would enable logistics providers to provide a better experience. When I was introduced to Ita, I got it instantly. He also has empathy for merchants and consumers about the consumer experience, and that stood out on many fronts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some 55 billion parcels are shipped in bubble wrap every year. Plastic bubble wrap is reliant on fossil fuels and 98% of plastic packaging is single-use. You can imagine the adverse environmental impact of all this plastic.</p>
<p>The founders of <a href="http://woola.io">Woola</a> were running an online e-commerce store and saw the packaging problem first-hand. The lack of options in sustainable and scalable protective packaging led to them re-discovering wool — an unused resource that is elastic and regulates temperatures and humidity.</p>
<p>The result was their startup, which uses leftover sheep wool to replace bubble wrap. These wool-based packages can be reused, repurposed, or returned by the end-user, with the ultimate goal of making the solution ‘closed-loop’ so nothing goes to waste.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Woola opened a production facility in Estonia and launched its first product in December 2020. Wool envelopes were the first products to hit the market. It’s now expanding to the UK, France and Germany. The next product rolling out in January 2022 is targeted at beverage companies.</p>
<p>They’ve now a raised €2.5M Seed round led by Future Ventures. Future is joined by co-investors Kaarel Kotkas (CEO at Veriff), Janer Gorohhov (Co-founder at Veriff), Kristina Lilleõis (VP of People at Veriff), Zem Joaquin (founder of Near Future Summit), Bryan Meehan (executive chair of Blue Bottle Coffee). Woola’s previous investors include the co-founders of Pipedrive, Bolt and the angel fund Lemonade Stand.</p>
<p>“Bubble wrap has been dominating the packaging industry for ages – but its decline is inevitable,” said Woola’s CEO and co-founder Anna-Liisa Palatu. “The industry is broken for two reasons: fossil fuel reliance and single-use mindset. We need to get rid of both to make packaging more sustainable.” She is joined by co-founders Jevgeni Sirai and Katrin Kabun.</p>
<p>Steve Jurvetson from Future Ventures commented: “While e-commerce is booming, single-use plastic packaging is out of control. Woola can replace it all with beautiful envelopes made from scrap wool that would otherwise be burned or buried. The world needs sustainable alternatives to the petrochemical economy for a healthier future.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sheep wool is an unused resource – more than 200,000 tonnes of wool is thrown away in Europe yearly. Woola says this is enough to fulfill 120% of the global bubble wrap demand.</p>
<p>The startup will compete with whitelabel plastic bubble wrap and alternatives like Ranpak and S-Packaging.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment &#8212; which co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://za.linkedin.com/in/eerik&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjV-56z1_P0AhVF14UKHXxhDg8Qjjh6BAgDEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BvAbzxJKTZ_UKLgOTiCX1">Eerik Oja</a> called a bridge round &#8212; is a prequel to a larger Series A round next year. It comprises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $6 million equity and $24 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company raised $2.4 million in a seed round in June 2020 and followed it with $10 million in debt from emerging markets-focused <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi47a7L1_P0AhUkxIUKHWjwC3sQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3MmURVyrRSRpMST5nAYFVz">venture debt fund Lendable</a> in December. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund doubled its participation in this recently raised debt round at $20 million, while other investors completed the rest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, through its early-stage investment vehicle, <a href="https://www.naspers.com/foundry">Naspers Foundry</a>, led the equity round with $3.4 million. Existing investors include Change Ventures, the lead investor from Planet42’s seed round, as well as Startup Wise Guys, Martin and Markus Villig of Bolt, and Ragnar Sass of Pipedrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42, though based in South Africa, has Estonian roots due to the founders’ heritage: Oja and CFO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ee.linkedin.com/in/marten-orgna&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixy86k2PP0AhVBzRoKHc3aCrcQjjh6BAgIEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw1u7QGEe_NBaeXmQ_gVyHT_">Marten Orgna</a> founded the company in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an interview, Oja mentioned that they created the car subscription model to cater to private individuals ignored by South African banks when they need vehicle financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our car subscription [model] is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">socially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inclusive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differentiating factor is our customers would not have a car without us,” Oja said, adding that because the company is buying second-hand cars, the unit cost is lower compared to a subscription model that purchases new cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be challenging to get a personal car in most emerging markets, especially if one’s income isn’t stable. And without a good credit history, lenders tend to ignore people with bad credit or give them unfavorable interest rates for vehicle financing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 is one of the few upstarts focused on the African market tackling this inequality via a car subscription offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company claims to use proprietary scoring algorithms superior to traditional credit scores in assessing risk in underbanked customer segments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has over 700 dealerships. And with its algorithms, customers can find out what budget suits them and choose new or pre-owned cars from Planet42’s dealerships network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Planet42 buys the car and rents it out to the customer on a subscription basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 claims that of all the customers served so far, 89% would have had no other means of gaining access to a personal vehicle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve gotten so good with our scoring that we can now enable the customers who couldn’t get bank financing to get a brand new car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have figured out a way how to do it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we can put entry-level brand new cars in the hands of the same target market and customers who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ignored by banks,” the chief executive said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years later and $50 million in equity and debt raised later, Planet42 has listed more than 7,000 cars to customers in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number was 3,000 when Oja spoke with TechCrunch in March, and he noted that the company grew 25% month on month in 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

While Moove focuses on financing ride-hailing cars, Planet42 and Autochek services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at private individuals. Planet42 has a cohesive network of automobile industry stakeholders on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Moove and Autochek have made inroads into other African countries after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching from Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Planet42, the next attractive market lies off the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not doing it right now, but we’re not ruling it out for the future,” Oja answered on whether Planet42 would expand into other parts of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the main reason is market size. South Africa has like 25% of all the passenger cars on the African continent; that means that whatever market we go next in Africa will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be smaller than South Africa. In South Africa, 1.1 million second-hand cars get sold and bought every year. In Mexico, that number is 7 million. So the Mexican market is six times larger than South Africa. So we want to go for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it has bought its first cars for clients in Mexico. Similar challenges stemming from transport inequality abound in the country, where 63% of the population deal with only cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mexico is one of the few countries Planet42 plans to expand to in the foreseeable future, said Oja, who also said that the company has set up an office and employed two staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company hopes to have bought over 1 million cars for its customers across its present and future markets by 2025. Planet42 said it has also made strides in becoming a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/why-south-africa-based-car-subscription-company-planet42-is-going-carbon-neutral/amp/">carbon-neutral company</a> via a wind farm project in Northern Cape, South Africa. The car subscription company financed the farm for months with money from carbon offset credits.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapdeal filed for an initial public offering on Tuesday, joining a number of firms in India that have tapped the public market this year.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-based startup, which counts SoftBank among its backers, said in its draft prospectus that it will issue fresh shares worth $165 million. Some of its existing investors including SoftBank, Sequoia Capital India and Foxconn plan to sell as many as 30.7 million secondary shares in the IPO.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm, which once competed with Amazon and Flipkart in India, has lost considerable market share in recent years and shifted focus to serve consumers in smaller cities and towns.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snapdeal, which has raised over $1.7 billion to date (according to Crunchbase and Tracxn) says more than 50 million unique customers have shopped at least once on its platform since April 2018. &#8220;75%+ of our business comes from repeat customers. More than 70% of our sales are from beyond Tier 2 towns and cities and 99% of our orders come via mobile phones. And we cover 96% of the pin codes in the country. Our users browse and connect with us in seven languages, beyond Hindi and English,&#8221; co-founder and chief executive Kunal Bahl (pictured above) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-buys-from-snapdeal-kunal-bahl/">wrote</a> in recent LinkedIn post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building Snapdeal 2.0 has meant creating all the required underlying capabilities to serve value-savvy users, staying within the guardrails of good economics and moving fast with bold and decisive steps,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The shift in focus came after months-long talks to merge the business with Flipkart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/flipkart-flipdeal-snapdeal-snapdead/">didn&#8217;t materialize in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In its prospectus today, Snapdeal said it generated an operating revenue of $31.9 million in six months ending in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More than half a dozen consumer-focused Indian startups have filed for an IPO this year. While some including Zomato and Nykaa have made stellar debuts, others including Paytm, which filed for the nation&#8217;s largest IPO, has consistently performed below its issue share price. Insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar has also lost all its IPO gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Morris Jr., founder and managing partner of the L.A.-based venture firm <a href="https://chapterone.com/en/">Chapter One</a>, just closed a $40 million early-stage fund to focus on web3 investments, and he&#8217;s in the process of raising a separate, $20 million opportunity fund.</p>
<p>Even in this go-go market, where digital assets are suddenly top of mind for everyone, the achievements are notable for someone who hasn&#8217;t been a VC for all that long and is a solo general partner.</p>
<p>To learn more about his path in building Chapter One &#8212; which is small but growing and counts new hires from both Facebook and Stripe &#8212; we talked recently with Morris Jr., who focused on product and revenue at Tinder for four years until leaving in late 2019. We wondered what there is to learn about how an operator transitions into a full-time investing role; he suggested that a lot of it comes down to hustle and luck and social media savvy, both to build an audience and, more than ever, to track down hot deals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, like a lot of investors, Morris Jr. got his start by writing checks on the side of his full-time job. Specifically, in 2016, aided in part by the sheen of Tinder, he wound up putting together one of the larger syndicates on the AngelList platform, where he says he went on to raise 15 special purpose vehicles.</p>
<p>Some of those companies have broken out since, including Density, a startup developing people-counting, AI-powered sensors that last month announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/10/density-which-provides-occupancy-tracking-sensors-to-companies-raises-125m/">$125 million</a> in funding at a post-money valuation of  $1.05 billion.</p>
<p>Deals didn&#8217;t automatically find their way to Morris, Jr., he says. He built a network by digging into Twitter to build an online audience (he has nearly 106,000 followers); he also messaged a whole lot of people who he saw were backing other people&#8217;s syndicates on AngelList.</p>
<p>Along the way, he began seeing more and more crypto deals that he wanted to fund. There were so many of these, in fact, that at some point, he says, he began to run out of enough capital to invest. By his telling, a role with Index Ventures materialized around that same time and he became a scout for the powerhouse firm, investing in a handful of seed rounds, including Dapper Labs, a blockchain company behind the popular NFT game &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; that&#8217;s currently valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">$7.6 billion</a>, and the centralized finance platform Compound Labs, whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">native token</a> has already returned many millions of dollars to early investors in the outfit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Armed with those wins &#8212; he says that particular scout fund for Index wound up being marked up by more than 30x &#8212; Morris Jr. set out to raise his own fund. At first, he hopped back on AngelList, raising $1 million from the first related email he sent to prospective investors, he says. Feeling emboldened, he quit his job at Tinder and decided to invest full time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it very much seems the right move. That debut fund went on to raise $10 million altogether, and the momentum has built from there. In perhaps the most critical development for Morris Jr., Chapter One&#8217;s newest fund has garnered commitments from some of the numerous multistage venture firms that now invest substantial dollars in emerging managers in order to get more exposure to founders they might miss otherwise.</p>
<p>In Chapter One&#8217;s case, the limited partners that are providing some of capital include Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Bain Capital. Acting in a personal capacity, Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z are also investors in Chapter One&#8217;s new fund. (Asked why Index is not also an investor, he says they don&#8217;t invest directly in other managers&#8217; funds.)</p>

<p>That kind of network certainly helps when Chapter One is in a competitive situation. What bigger boast can a seed-stage manager make than to explain he has inroads into the biggest venture firms in the world?</p>
<p>There is also the potential for conflict, presumably, which is maybe the point. Asked who among Chapter One&#8217;s venture backers gets to see its deals first, Morris Jr. says he has structured things in such a way that &#8220;everybody gets the same information at the same time.&#8221; He then adds that for some deals, he defers to founders who want him to &#8220;sequence those intros,&#8221; as well as advises them based on what he knows about each firm&#8217;s &#8220;taste.&#8221; It&#8217;s very &#8220;case by case,&#8221; and a &#8220;bit of a curation exercise.&#8221; he says, &#8220;where you know which partners at which funds will be attracted to specific types of companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for where Chapter One is shopping, because of Morris Jr.&#8217;s success to date with companies like Dapper and Compound Labs, the firm is pushing the pedal to the metal on web3 products and platforms, with five bets from the new fund already across DAO infrastructure, NFT experiences, and learn-to-earn games. (The most famous of these types of games is &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; but a growing number of them is emerging and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">capturing VC dollars</a>.)</p>

<p>On this front, Morris Jr. says there are numerous reasons founders who are moving into the space might want to talk with Chapter One. He says, for example, that Chapter One intends to spend much of 2022 building out support services, including a media arm focused on web3 education, and resources for developers who are looking to better understand token usability and governance and how to create digital assets that are equitable for the communities to which they cater.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding those founders in the first place, Morris Jr. points back to his use of social media, saying that large Twitter presence helps, but so does logging time elsewhere online.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a member, most importantly, of &#8220;hundreds of Discord groups,&#8221; noting that &#8220;the more you participate in the community, the more you meet interesting people. It&#8217;s like going to a great conference.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>For web3 investors, he adds, &#8220;It’s the new way of networking.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, when LinkedIn began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/linkedin-real-name-phone-number-verification-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for Chinese users&#8217; phone numbers</a>, it was clear that the professional social network would have to follow a different set of rules in the country. But it realized simply setting up the real-name verification regime required by Chinese authorities wasn&#8217;t enough; it faced a mounting task of balancing censorship demand and upholding its &#8220;Western value&#8221; that extols freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The solution was to retreat. This past October, Microsoft announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring an end to LinkedIn&#8217;s Chinese version</a> &#8212; which still functioned largely the same as the &#8220;global&#8221; one barring, extra requirements like cell number verification. On December 13, Microsoft <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/december/linkedin-s-new-app-to-help-professionals-in-china-find-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a LinkedIn alternative called InCareer </a>on China&#8217;s App Store and third-party Android stores. Focusing on jobs, the new app bears the facade of LinkedIn but lacks its social feed and content posting option, which would otherwise require content monitoring efforts by Microsoft&#8217;s team in China. InCareer still keeps the messaging feature.</p>
<p>In a blog <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, LinkedIn explained its move:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed. We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is not the only foreign tech giant that has pulled its service from China. In recent years, China has introduced a slew of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new cyber regulations</a> to rein in everything from how much data internet firms can collect to how they move data across borders. Yahoo, TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exited China</a> citing an &#8220;increasingly challenging business and legal environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>China-based users with the LinkedIn app are now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a544167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted to download InCareer</a>, though they can still access the full version of the social network via a web browser and VPN. But these extra fences are set to drive users away from a platform that already had limited reach in the country.</p>
<p>LinkedIn was popular mostly among expats and Chinese users working at multinationals or cross-border businesses, while its local competitor Maimai has more prominence. In April, Maimai accounted for 91% of the time Chinese users spent on professional social networking apps, according to <a href="https://www.iresearch.com.cn/m/Detail/report?id=3825&amp;isfree=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market research firm iResearch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s other surviving service in China, Bing, also ran into a hitch recently. The search engine became inaccessible in China on December 18, according to user reports and <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greatfire.org</a>, though it appeared to have come back online as of December 20. TechCrunch has reached out to Microsoft regarding the situation.</p>
<p>The incident also coincided with Bing&#8217;s suspension of its search autofill feature in China for 30 days &#8220;under PRC laws,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://cn.bing.com/cnlegal?mkt=zh-CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> posted by the search engine provider. It&#8217;s unclear what laws the site was referring to.</p>
<p>Bing was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly down in China in 2019</a> when its indigenous rival Baidu&#8217;s reputation took a hit. At the time, speculation was rife that Baidu users migrating to Bing in droves might have crashed the American site.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see foreign tech companies playing catch-up with Chinese laws after being left alone for years. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiated a wave of crackdown</a> on unlicensed mobile games from its Chinese App Store years after the relevant regulation took effect. The Bing suspension might well be a similar case where the search engine, which had long been under the radar in China because few people used it, was finally ordered to close the loophole &#8212; autofill suggestions that could get on the censors&#8217; nerves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, December 20! Now deep into the second half of December, you’d think that we’d be down to spare news pickings. Not a bit of it! We had a 10-figure deal today, an IPO filing and startup news galore. So strap in &#8212; no taking breaks quite yet! To work! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/"><strong>Oracle buys Cerner in $28B deal:</strong></a> This is a big darn deal. Oracle everyone is familiar with, but what is Cerner? Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a>, Cerner is an electronic healthcare records company. Naturally, a major tech company buying something in the health data space may have your hackles up, but analysts that TechCrunch spoke to generally liked the deal, so what’s worry about?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/"><strong>Inside Justworks’ IPO filing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Late last week, SMB-focused HR software provider Justworks filed to go public. Today, TechCrunch took a deeper look into its filing, curious about its economics and overall business performance. The company raised extensive capital during its life as a private company, so this is a big venture-backed exit to keep tabs on in early 2022. (Along with Reddit!)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/rocket-companies-buys-truebill-for-1-275b/"><strong>Rocket buys TrueBill for $1.275B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And because one billion-dollar-plus deal wasn’t enough to keep us busy today, Rocket Companies announced its huge buy of consumer fintech TrueBill in an all-cash deal. TechCrunch noted that with TrueBill set to reach around $100 million ARR this year, per its acquirer, the transaction felt somewhat inexpensive. For investors that got a quick double on their most recent investment, it’s a nice win.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>There were a number of huge pieces of startup news today, and a plethora of smaller, yet still critical, updates. So, largest first, and then as many of the smaller notes as we can fit into this newsletter!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/rec-room-raises-145m-at-a-3-5b-valuation-for-its-user-generated-immersive-gaming-platform/"><strong>Rec Room raises $145M at a $3.5B valuation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Why is a social gaming platform raising that kind of money? Well, Roblox. That’s the answer. How so? Because Roblox showed that user-created games atop a centralized platform can generate simply huge incomes, and investors are betting that Rec Room’s twist on the concept is going to be a cash cow in time. The company was worth $1.25 billion earlier this year, so its new valuation may be frothy, but investors are willing to pay up in part thanks to Roblox being worth north of $58 billion as of this afternoon, no doubt.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zerofox-public-spac/"><strong>ZeroFox is going public via a SPAC:</strong></a> This is a fun one. Per TechCrunch, ZeroFox is an “enterprise threat intelligence cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on social media.” So, it’s a software company going public via a blank-check company. The deal values ZeroFox at around $1.4 billion. You can read the deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823575/000114036121042363/brhc10031871_ex99-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, if that’s your jam. But the deal shows that the SPAC boom is not over — yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/"><strong>$100M for fast groceries in India:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Zepto is a fast grocery delivery service, the sort of business that wants to bring you items in 10 minutes or less. The model is proving popular in Europe and North America, with companies like Zapp and Gopuff putting up big numbers. Zepto is a notable round because the deal is a big one, and because it more than doubles the company’s valuation “to $570 million from $225 million less than two months ago as [the company] expands into newer cities.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/turing-books-87m-at-a-1-1b-valuation-to-help-source-hire-and-manage-engineers-remotely/">Remote hiring is big business:</a> </strong>That’s what Turing’s new round tells us. The company just raised an $87 million Series D for its “talent cloud,” a service that “uses AI to source, evaluate, hire, onboard and then manage engineers remotely,” TechCrunch reports. The new capital pushes Turing’s valuation to $1.1 billion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ai-chip-kneron-25-million-funding/">Kneron raises $25M for AI chips:</a> </strong>Given the global chip shortage/fiasco, I am in favor of more capital flowing into chip companies, startups included. What Kneron is building won’t help Ford build more trucks, but its AI chips are “semiconductors designed to accelerate machine learning” we wrote, which still sounds pretty important.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ameelios-free-video-calling-for-inmates-2022-launch/">Nonprofit startup works to lessen predatory inmate pricing:</a></strong> Not every startup that is built is designed to either save a pension fund or allow a venture capitalist to finally stop flying business class. In the case of Ameelio, the company is building free calls for inmates. If you aren’t familiar with the U.S. carceral state, know that my nation has found it palatable, somehow, to <em>profit</em> off the incarcerated through both private prisons and exorbitant costs for the locked-up to access phone calls and other services. Ameelio could shake that up with no-cost video calling services. Let’s hope.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/interactive-streaming-platform-adventr-raises-5-in-seed-funding/">Adventr rminds m of th Wb 2.0 glry dys:</a> </strong>Remember when startups would just drop letters from a word and call it a name? It was a good time. Adventr is bringing the trend back with its name and the fact that it is working to make video more interactive. Very Web 2.0, once again in a way that I don’t mind. The company just raised $5 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/overjet-sinks-its-teeth-into-another-round-of-capital-for-its-dental-ai-tech/">The AI dentist will see you now:</a> </strong>Overjet is a company I’ve covered before, so it’s nice to see it crop up again on our pages. The company is now worth north of $400 million thanks to a new $42.5 million Series B. Overjet uses AI to help dentists make decisions about teeth, which I dig thanks to the fact that I ate too much candy as a child and didn’t floss during much of my 20s.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/real-time-soil-testing-agtech-startup-stenon-raises-20m-series-a-funding-round/">Stenon is working on dirt data:</a> </strong>Agtech is a fun part of the technology world because it involves the application of new methods to what is just about the oldest human endeavor there is, namely trying to coax food out of the ground. Stenon is directly involved with that work, providing farmers with what TechCrunch described as a “real-time soil-sensing solution.” That means data from the dirt. Why does that matter? Well, soil water content can greatly impact harvest timing, for example. Stenon just closed a $20 million Series A.</li>

<p>The pandemic ushered in &#8220;the digital healthcare revolution,&#8221; and patients and providers alike are unlikely to turn back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthcare deals were hot in the first nine months in 2021,&#8221; GHI Fund President Bill Taranto writes in a guest post. &#8220;They brought in a total of $21.3 billion in venture funding across 541 deals, dwarfing the previous record of $14.6 billion set in 2020, according to Rock Health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taranto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/the-growing-power-of-digital-healthcare-6-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">rounds up six trends to watch</a> in the New Year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telemedicine changing how chronic conditions are treated.</li>
<li>Digital therapeutics rewriting the future of healthcare.</li>
<li>Social determinants of health resulting in greater health equity.</li>
<li>Remote health monitoring improving outcomes and lowering costs.</li>
<li>Real-world data delivering real-world results.</li>
<li>Healthcare becoming truly patient-centric.</li>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/youtube-tv-settles-its-contract-dispute-with-disney-credits-customers-15/"><strong>YouTube TV and Disney make nice:</strong></a><strong> </strong>There is an interesting, recurring game of chicken that content providers and content deliverers play when it comes to your cable bill. And even Alphabet’s YouTube TV is not immune. After a spat with Disney over money — what else, with the mouse company — a deal has been reached that will see Disney channels stay on YouTube TV. Customers of the latter service will get a $15 credit for the disruption.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/meta-files-federal-lawsuit-to-uncover-individuals-running-a-phishing-scam-on-its-platforms/">Meta sues phishers:</a> </strong>The company formerly known as Facebook is suing a phishing group that went after its users’ account credentials. One, good. Good on Facebook for doing this. And, two, why don’t we hear more about this sort of work more often?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/line-to-launch-nft-service-linenext-next-year/">Line to pursue more NFT work in 2022:</a> </strong>You cannot shake a stick in technology today and not wind up accidentally hitting an NFT play, so, here’s today’s. Line, the popular messaging service in Japan, is launching an NFT service in markets outside of Japan next year. But don’t worry if you are in Line’s main market &#8212; the company is “separately operating its NFT market beta version through Line Bitmax wallet that is fit” for Japan, TechCrunch writes.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European e-scooter market is currently the main battleground for companies playing in the micromobility space, taking advantage as they are of Europe’s relatively compact cities and the desire of populations to move to more sustainable transportation. In 2021, players like Tier, Voi and Dott continued to raise VC backing.</p>
<p>But the war for funding is ultimately about who will win in this coveted market &#8212; either through market domination via raising the most capital, putting pressure on competitors or by acquiring said competitors.</p>
<p>Thus, the latest chapter in this saga is about to play out, with the news that <a href="https://www.voiscooters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voi</a> Technology &#8212; a major European micromobility operator &#8212; has raised a $115 million Series D funding round in what it describes as an oversubscribed financing round that, says the company, will power its expansion into new markets. Voi already has scooters in 70 cities across the U.K. and Europe. This round comes after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/micromobility-startup-voi-raises-45-million-to-end-sidewalk-riding-improve-safety/">raised</a> $45 million in only August this year. Total capital raised in 2021 amounts to $160 million, and $500 million since Voi launched.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As well as expanding, this raise is also about a future IPO. A spokesperson said: “Following this fundraise, Voi is going to start preparing for an IPO. Voi will begin preparations but the timetable cannot be set in stone at this stage.”</p>
<p>Fredrik Hjelm, co-founder and CEO of Voi Technology, said in a statement: “There is no doubting that micromobility is here to stay and Voi intends to be the go-to mobility platform in Europe for cities that want to give their residents and visitors an integrated, smart mode way to travel. Working closely with cities we are seeing a new vision of urban transport taking shape that is highly complementary to public transport. We are building the future of transport and we are committed to making every Voi city a better place to live.”</p>
<p>With cities starting to adopt regulations and grant licenses, the way that micromobility operators are scaling is by getting approvals from city officials, thus securing their access to consumers. So this war chest is partly about being able to scale to meet those licenses.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added: “The demand for micro mobility has never been higher and as a result, we want to ensure we are delivering the service people need. With this funding, we’re going to invest in solutions for our rides and cities, including fixing parking, pavement riding and twin riding, rolling out a better model of e-scooter and investing in R&amp;D.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round was led by Raine Group and VNV Global (which led the last funding round), and included Inbox Capital, Nordic Ninja, Stena Sessan, Kreos Capital and new investors Ilmarinen, Nineyards Equity and ICT Capital and others. Entrepreneurs and operators from King, Avito, BCG and more also participated.</p>
<p>Voi claims it has achieved a 140% year on year revenue growth in 2021, while increasing margins and profitability. Voi also won a lot of city tenders this year, putting pressure on competitors.</p>
<p>Of course, microbilitlity companies are also pushing at an open door, taking advantage of the news trend among cities to reduce the reliance on private cars, relieve congestion, lower carbon emission and cut pollution, as well as the individual desire to avoid crowds on public transport because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Voi is also planning to launch the &#8220;Voiager 5&#8221;, which it claims will be the safest e-scooter model to date. Its arrival will be timely.</p>
<p>The potential for fires started by e-scooter battery packs was highlighted in the U.K. recently when Vio was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-59664406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to withdraw</a> part of its fleet from rental after one its machines began burning in a user&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Commenting, Jack Samler, general manager at Voi U.K., told TechCrunch: “We had an instance of smoke being emitted from one of our Long Term Rental e-scooters in Bristol earlier this month. This was an isolated, one-off, incident with one of our Long Term Rental scooters. As an extreme precautionary measure, we asked users to keep the scooters outside whilst we assessed the situation &#8212; all users have been refunded for the inconvenience for the month of December.”</p>
<p>He said the service was only temporarily stopped as a result of this smoking scooter, but following an investigation, the service quickly resumed: “The vast majority of users are already using the service again, and we expect all riders to continue enjoying our Long Term Rental service to move around in a sustainable manner very soon.”</p>
<p>Assuming all those batteries get safer, Voi is also committing to use only battery cells produced in Europe, with a resulting 50% lower carbon footprint given they wouldn’t be imported from China, by early 2023. It already sources its e-bikes from Europe.</p>
<p>Jason Schretter, partner and head of EMEA at Raine Group, said: “We are excited to continue our support of Voi in its efforts to bring safe and sustainable micro mobility solutions to markets across Europe. Since we first invested a year ago, Voi’s commitment to product innovation, operational efficiency and local partnerships have helped the company extend its leadership position in the region.”</p>
<p>Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global said: “We are reaching a tipping point with micromobility where cities, led by their residents, are waking up to the full potential of this new mode of transport.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European e-scooter race continues apace. Tier, a Berlin-based e-scooter company that’s quickly expanding throughout Europe, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/e-scooter-company-tier-acquires-wind-mobilitys-italian-subsidiary/">acquired</a> Vento Mobility, the Italian subsidiary of Wind Mobility.</p>
<p>But scooter companies continue to battle the bad publicity from the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/escooters-accidents-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grisly accidents and crashes</a> currently blighting the image of this, admittedly hot, sector.</p>

<h2>SpaceX breaks a reusability record and records its first two-launch day</h2>
<p>SpaceX launched another batch of its Starling satellites from its launch facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base on Saturday morning, then followed that up with a launch of a Turkish communications satellite from Cape Canaveral Florida late that night. This marks the first time that SpaceX has launched twice in one day, and the Starlink mission also included the eleventh flight and landing for its Falcon 9 booster, besting a re-use record for SpaceX&#8217;s launch system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That would be impressive enough on its own, but now SpaceX is set to deliver another load of supplies and experiment materials to the International Space Station for its latest Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission. That&#8217;s currently scheduled for tomorrow morning, taking off from Cape Canaveral.</p>

<h2>A look back at 2021 from the perspective of space investors</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we just wrapped our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Space 2021 event</a>, and one of the more interesting discussions for the startup community was definitely our chat with a panel of early-stage investors looking at the sector. Some, like Space Capital founder Chad Anderson, have seen the space industry evolve considerably over many years of placing early bets on startups, and could speak to the major shifts going on in the industry. Assembly Ventures&#8217; Jessica Robinson spoke to how space tech is bleeding out into just about every other area, and vice versa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise software companies are suddenly focused firmly on healthcare. If you want proof, look at how Oracle and Microsoft both backed up trucks loaded with money to buy health tech companies this year.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m compiling the top 10 M&amp;A deals of the year, and the top two transactions are today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">$28.3 billion agreement</a> by Oracle to buy Cerner and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal</a> to buy Nuance Communications in April. That comes to just under $50 billion for two health-related companies.</p>
<p>Other majors are circling the health market. Amazon has been quieter about it, but over the last year, it too has <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-shakes-up-healthcare-strategy-in-2021-a-timeline-of-key-developments.html">been looking at healthcare,</a> with partnerships, hirings and programs galore focused on the lucrative vertical. Google&#8217;s approach was less certain, as its healthcare vertical leader, David Feinberg, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cerner-names-dr-david-feinberg-president-and-ceo">jumped in October to Cerner</a>, the company Oracle bought this morning.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of interest because healthcare is a simply huge market. In its announcement, Oracle quoted a popular figure that the U.S. healthcare business alone is worth $3.8 trillion annually. When you extrapolate that figure to the entire world, it&#8217;s no wonder big companies are willing to make enormous bets to get a piece of it.</p>
<p>But beyond the obvious market potential, what is Oracle getting for its money? We spoke to some industry experts to get their take.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with some numbers. In its most recent earnings report, Cerner produced revenue of $1.47 billion in the third quarter, a rather modest 7% growth on a year-on-year basis. So the company wasn&#8217;t exactly growing in leaps and bounds, making it a good takeover target. If you figure Cerner was on a $6 billion run rate, that makes the deal worth just under 5x revenue, which is kind of the middle of the road these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, formerly known as Facebook, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-legal-action-against-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it has filed a federal lawsuit in California court to take action to uncover individuals running a phishing scam. The company says the legal action aims to disrupt phishing attacks that are designed to trick people into sharing their login credentials on fake login pages for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>For context, phishing attacks lure unsuspecting victims to websites that appear legitimate but are actually deceptively fake. The websites then persuade victims to enter their sensitive information, such as passwords and email addresses. Meta says it found more than 39,000 websites that are impersonating the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp as part of the phishing scheme. It also notes that reports of phishing attacks have been on the rise and that it is filing this lawsuit to take legal action against these attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;On these websites, people were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords, which Defendants collected,&#8221; Jessica Romero, Meta&#8217;s director of platform enforcement and litigation, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;As part of the attacks, Defendants used a relay service to redirect internet traffic to the phishing websites in a way that obscured their attack infrastructure. This enabled them to conceal the true location of the phishing websites, and the identities of their online hosting providers and the defendants.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249978" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Romero says that in March, Meta started working with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs that hosted the phishing websites. Meta plans to continue to collaborate with online service providers to disrupt phishing attacks. It notes that it works to proactively block instances of abuse to the security community, domain name registrars and others. The company says it also shares phishing URLs so other platforms can block them as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology.&#8221; Romero wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s latest lawsuit isn&#8217;t the first time that the company has cracked down on phishing scams on its platforms. Last month, Meta revealed that it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/taking-action-against-hackers-in-pakistan-and-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took action against</a> four several groups of hackers from Syria and Pakistan. The groups used phishing links to manipulate users into giving up their Facebook credentials. Earlier this year in March, the company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took action against</a> a group of hackers in China known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. Meta, which was known as Facebook at the time, said it disrupted the hackers&#8217; ability to use their infrastructure to abuse its platform. The company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took similar action</a> against hackers in Bangledesh and Vietnam in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zepto, a Mumbai-based startup that operates a 10-minute instant grocery delivery service, has more than doubled its valuation to $570 million from $225 million less than two months ago as it expands into newer cities.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund led the $100 million Series C round in Zepto, the two said Monday. Glade Brook, Nexus, Breyer Capital, Lachy Groom, Global Founders Capital and Contrary Capital also participated in the round, which brings its to-date raise to $160 million.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by two 19-year-old entrepreneurs who left Stanford last year, came out of stealth mode in November. But long before it began talking about the business, Zepto had captured immense interest from the local startup community as people began voicing their opinion about the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="http://zeptonow.com">Zepto</a>, whose name playfully uses a <a href="https://twitter.com/pacificleo/status/1452554053603450884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mathematical term</a> to describe the business, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, a category that has become red hot in several parts of the world in recent quarters. Heavily-backed players Swiggy and BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers) have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">entered the instant grocery delivery business</a>.</p>
<p>Zepto’s arrival in the scene, too, was serendipitous. Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra had returned to India for a break shortly before the pandemic engulfed the nation.</p>
<p>The teenagers, who previously collaborated on a number of projects, including a ride-hailing commute app for school kids, suddenly found themselves locked in their houses in Mumbai. As the pandemic raged, the two struggled to get their grocery supplies even as grocery deliveries, categorized as essential by the local government, was still permitted in much of the nation.</p>
<p>“We felt that the online play of the Indian grocery delivery space, which is one of the world’s largest, was grappling with some gross execution errors,” Palicha claimed in an earlier interview without elaborating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview last week, Palicha said the startup is overwhelmed with the support and excitement it is seeing from the customers, but it doesn’t want to “become complacent.”</p>
<p>“We are somewhat overly critical of ourselves and hold ourselves to very high standards. People are happy that they are getting their deliveries in 10 minutes or less, but can we continue to focus on scaling our SKUs and improving our unit economics?” he said. (But at the same time, Zepto is cautious about keeping its employees and delivery partners happy, he said, pointing to the retention and internal feedback.)</p>
<p>Vohra said that its month-on-month buyer retention is 65% and has built a network of micro-warehouses, each of which has a capacity to do over 2,500 orders a day.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s e-grocery market that is estimated to be worth $25 billion by 2025, according to a note from Sanford C. Bernstein. “Online grocery penetration is expected to reach ~3-5%, by 2025 from less than 1% today. Long-term structural drivers remain strong: rising income and affluence, lower tier consumption, e- commerce penetration (~30% CAGR) and a young population (~50% below 25). Grocery spend as a proportion of income remains high at ~ 30%,” its analysts wrote.</p>

(<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zepto)</p></div></p>
<p>Zepto today operates in Bangalore, Delhi, Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad, and plans to soon expand to Pune and Kolkata. To ensure instant deliveries, it has set up a maze of over 100 dark stores across these cities that it says are optimized for fast deliveries.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha.</p>
<p>Another thing moving in the right direction for Zepto is the talent it has been able to attract in recent months. Several high-profile executives from Flipkart, Amazon Uber, Dream 11 and Pharmeasy have joined the startup.</p>
<p>Palicha said one of the reasons why so many executives have joined Zepto is that it has enabled many who had moved from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their home city. But the startup’s aggressive growth, disciplined execution, and ambitions have made it attractive for people with similar taste, he said. “We have been able to walk the walk,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are excited to double down and lead this round in Zepto (YC W21). Since Aadit and Kaivalya went through Y Combinator, we have observed that they&#8217;re exceptional founders who bring relentless focus and &#8220;Doordash-like&#8221; execution to the quick commerce model,” said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.</p>
<p>“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we&#8217;re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI chips, which are semiconductors designed to accelerate machine learning, have many applications. One of the promising use cases, according to Albert Liu, is using AI chips in autonomous driving vehicles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Liu&#8217;s AI chipmaking startup Kneron has been quietly racking up investments to march into smart transportation. It recently closed a new round of $25 million funding with Lite-On Technology, a Taiwanese optoelectronic pioneer, as a strategic investor. Other investors included Alltek, PalPilot, Sand Hill Angels and Gaingels.</p>
<p>The new proceeds lifted Kneron&#8217;s total funding to over $125 million since its inception in 2015. The San Diego- and Taipei-based company has assembled a list of renowned investors, including Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s Horizon Ventures, Alibaba, Qualcomm, Sequoia and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn</a>, the world&#8217;s largest electronics manufacturer and Apple&#8217;s supplier.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Liu previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> TechCrunch that the company was expected to turn profitable in 2023, which would be a &#8220;good time&#8221; to go public. When asked more recently, the founder was more tight-lipped about the firm&#8217;s IPO prospects, though he said the listing would likely be in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of L4 or L5 autonomous driving lies not only in the vehicle but also roadside AI,&#8221; Liu, who worked on computer vision at Qualcomm, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Kneron&#8217;s latest investment followed the release of its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/kneron-releases-its-first-automotive-grade-chip-for-adas-and-av-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-grade semiconductors</a> for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>With roadside perception units that can communicate with nearby vehicles, an ambulance would not have to stop at intersections, Liu explained. Such infrastructure is particularly useful in Asian countries where traffic conditions are more complicated than those in the U.S., he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the strategic investment, Kneron and Lite-On will jointly develop roadside AI boxes that will be powered by Kneron&#8217;s edge AI chips.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s chips are &#8220;reconfigurable&#8221;, meaning they combine the flexibility of software and the high speed of the hardware. In the case of AV, its silicon can be used for both the large AI engine inside a vehicle and powering the small sensors layered on the exterior of the car, explained Liu and as shown in this demo video:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLdt3wgnuDs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kneron is currently pulling in $3-4 million in monthly revenue from its pool of 30 enterprise customers; 30-40% of its revenues come from the U.S. at the moment.</span></p>
<p>The company has been forming deep alliances with industry partners. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Kneron agreed to</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.deltaww.com/en-us/news/7531" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> buy image signal processor Vatics</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from Vivotek, a subsidiary of Delta Electronics. Kneron counts Foxconn as a strategic investor, which has been using the startup&#8217;s chips in its &#8220;MIH&#8221; manufacturing platform for electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><em>The article was updated to reflect that Lite-On was a strategic investor and did not lead the round. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast has dubbed TikTok as the world&#8217;s third-largest social network, just behind Facebook and Instagram. In its <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/tiktok-is-the-third-largest-worldwide-social-network-behind-instagram-and-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural forecast</a> on TikTok&#8217;s global install base, Insider Intelligence &#8212; the firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-intelligence-emarketer-merger-details-2019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously known as eMarketer</a> &#8212; predicts that TikTok will reach 755.0 million monthly users in 2022, after seeing 59.8% growth in 2020, followed by 40.8% growth in 2021.</p>
<p>Facebook, as of its most recent <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FB-09.30.2021-Exhibit-99.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a>, reported 2.91 billion monthly active users after seeing 6% year-over-year growth. And recently, Instagram employees leaked its network had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed 2 billion</a> monthly users, up from the 1 billion monthly user milestone reported in June 2018.</p>
<p>However, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is referencing its own 2022 predictions, which uses a slightly different set of calculations. The firm has its own definition of a monthly active user that may differ from those of each company it analyzes. For example, it only counts users who log in at least once a month consistently over a calendar year period, and it attempts to weed out the fake accounts from its estimates. This is meant to provide clients with a more consistent &#8220;apples to apples&#8221; comparison across all platforms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249920" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the firm&#8217;s estimates, Facebook will reach 2.1 billion monthly users in 2022, followed by Instagram with 1.28 billion users. TikTok will follow with its 755 million monthly users, ahead of Snap and Twitter.</p>

<p>TikTok, over the past couple of years, has been growing quickly.</p>
<p>App intelligence firm Sensor Tower reported the short-form video app <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossed 2 billion downloads</a> across the App Store and Google Play in the first quarter of 2020. A separate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">report by App Annie</a> later found TikTok saw 325% growth in 2020, and the monthly time spent per user also grew faster than any other app &#8212; including by 65% in the U.S., surpassing Facebook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2021, Sensor Tower noted TikTok (including sister app Douyin in China) had become the first non-Facebook mobile app (outside of games) <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to reach 3 billion downloads globally</a> across the App Store and Google Play, while TikTok consumer spending surpassed $2.5 billion globally. This put the app in the company of only a handful of others that had reached that milestone, including Tinder, Netflix, YouTube and Tencent Video.</p>
<p>While other firms had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">predicted</a> TikTok&#8217;s monthly active user base would top 1 billion in 2021, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is a bit more conservative due to its methodology. But it does expect the app to continue to grow, if at a slower rate of 15.1% in 2022.</p>
<p>As a result of its growth, TikTok&#8217;s share of overall social networking users is also climbing upwards. Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast believes TikTok will surpass a 20% share for the first time and will approach a one-quarter share by 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of TikTok is especially challenging for Snapchat, with which it competes head-to-head for the youth audience,&#8221; remarked Insider Intelligence principal analyst, Debra Aho Williamson. &#8220;Although TikTok does not share much similarity to Twitter, its massive size relative to the more-established platform is a clear reflection of the addictive nature of TikTok’s content,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of room for TikTok&#8217;s future growth, the firm also pointed out, as next year, 3.57 billion people will use a social networking app at least once per month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://rocketcompanies.com">Rocket Companies</a> <a href="https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Acquire-Truebill-Adding-Rapidly-Expanding-Financial-Empowerment-FinTech-to-the-Rocket-Platform/default.aspx">announced</a> this morning that it will purchase <a href="https://www.truebill.com/">Truebill</a> for $1.275 billion in cash.</p>
<p>Rocket Companies is best known for its Rocket Mortgage product, while Truebill is a consumer-facing app that helps consumers manage subscriptions, automate savings and budget. The deal&#8217;s price tag will prove lucrative for Truebill shareholders. PitchBook <a href="http://pitchbook.com">data indicates</a> that Truebill&#8217;s final private valuation was $530 million after its last round was counted. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">$45 million investment took place earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>So, a quick more-than-double for Truebill&#8217;s final investors, and an even bigger return for its earlier backers. Not bad, right?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Let&#8217;s play<em> Guess! That! Multiple!</em></h2>
<p>Given that Truebill is selling for a hair under $1.3 billion, you have the information you need to come up with an estimate for the startup&#8217;s annual recurring revenue (ARR). In broad terms, where do you think the company&#8217;s top line will land at the end of the year?</p>
<p>If you guessed something around $50 million, our heads are in the same spot. Tech valuations are high despite some recent declines, and fintech is hot. So, a multiple in the mid-20s felt like a good guess.</p>
<p><em>Wrong.</em> Here&#8217;s Rocket (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>This new line of business will also add consistent monthly revenue for Rocket Companies. Today, monthly payments made by clients to the company&#8217;s mortgage servicing operations generate $1.3 billion in servicing income on an annualized basis. Rocket Companies boasts 2.5 million serviced clients and has an industry-best retention rate of 91 percent. <strong>Truebill is on track to generate $100 million in annual recurring revenue. That number is consistently growing, with 2021 revenue more than doubling that of 2020.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Hot dang. That&#8217;s a surprise.</p>
<p>Truebill is going to close out the year with roughly double the ARR that we anticipated. And even more, the company is doubling in size yearly. That&#8217;s the precise profile that companies want to put up before going public: big revenues and fast growth. And yet instead of going public, Truebill is selling itself for under 13x its current ARR. That number will compress as time continues, to the single digits in 2022, provided that growth can keep up at Truebill in the new year.</p>
<p>It feels rather cheap, frankly.</p>
<p>The deal being all-cash means that Rocket might have gotten a discount of sorts; shares are cheaper than cash, and Truebill likely could have eked out another $100 million if the deal had been, say, 50% stock. We&#8217;re speaking in very loose numbers, mind.</p>
<p>Still, the deal is good news of a sort, but also an omen. Why did a ~100% growth, nearly nine-figure ARR fintech just sell for barely unicorn money? As noted, the price means sweet, sweet holiday liquidity for Truebill&#8217;s backers, but for other fintech companies that may have just received an unwelcome comp for the holidays, the numbers are hardly bullish. They feel a bit soft, honestly.</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;re seeing the impact of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">Nubank&#8217;s somewhat slack IPO</a>. Or this could just be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/lets-talk-about-the-saas-selloff/">general downward tilt in software multiples</a> that we&#8217;ve seen in recent quarters. Or there&#8217;s something inside Truebill that is yucky &#8212; perhaps it has far greater sales and marketing expenses than we might anticipate; fusing itself to Rocket could lower its customer acquisition costs, perhaps improving its economic profile.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Regardless, we&#8217;ll get more data when Rocket reports its first full quarter inclusive of Truebill. The deal is expected to close this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ameelio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ameelio</a>, a nonprofit startup that intends to replace inmate-paid video calling in prisons with a free service, is making inroads against the companies that have dominated the space for decades. With nine facilities in Iowa up and running and talks progressing with dozens more ahead of a planned 2022 launch, the company may soon usher in a fundamental change in how incarcerated people access communication and education.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/ameelio-wants-to-take-on-for-profit-prison-calling-rackets-after-starting-with-free-letters-to-inmates/">Founded less than two years ago</a>, Ameelio had its sights set on the calling system from the start, but began by offering a web and mobile service to send letters to inmates, which ordinarily is a surprisingly difficult process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We maybe had 8,000 users when we spoke to you, and a few months later we launched our mobile app. Now we&#8217;re hosting something like 300,000 users, in every state and some territories,&#8221; said Uzoma Orchingwa, founder and CEO of the company. But while letter writing is a useful service, the team&#8217;s efforts have been focused on developing and testing the suite of digital products they hope to offer across the country starting next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>By building their own tech stacks and shifting the resulting (much lower than market) costs away from inmates, Ameelio provides an enticing alternative to the totally outdated systems in most prisons today.</p>
<p>Many may not be aware that a handful of for-profit companies perform nearly all of the for-profit video-calling services used by the nation&#8217;s often for-profit prisons, which collect a share of this tainted revenue. Securus and Global Tel have provided calling services for a long time, and their business practices were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/fcc-commissioner-mignon-clyburn-talks-privacy-compromise-and-connecting-communities/">described by former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn</a> as &#8220;the clearest, most glaring type of market failure I’ve ever seen as a regulator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite costing nearly nothing to provide, calls can cost inmates as much as a dollar a minute — extortionate 10 years ago but positively criminal today, when free video calling is a basic feature we all expect for free or a nominal charge. The deeply unpopular Securus is in the middle of a rebranding (to &#8220;Aventis&#8221;) and potentially a SPAC deal to reinvent itself and purge the past, following the example of Facebook and Blackwater. But the zebra can&#8217;t change its stripes, and all that.</p>
<p>Not only that, but customers — that is to say, the Departments of Corrections that contract with these businesses — are beginning to doubt the value of the services being provided. The pandemic resulted in a suspension of in-person visits and their temporary replacement with free video calls, and Ameelio&#8217;s CTO Gabriel Saruhashi said that many a DOC would prefer to keep it that way. The old, and rather unethical, method of charging inmates and sharing the income is growing increasingly indefensible in the modern era, and they are more interested in keeping things simple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2249688" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249688" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2249688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Ameelio video call scheduling interface." width="1024" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png 1190w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-3.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2249688" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the Ameelio video call scheduling interface.</p></div></p>
<p>Orchingwa explained that they&#8217;ve structured Ameelio as a turnkey system for whatever level of involvement a facility or department chooses. The cumbrous RFP system for selecting providers of state-paid services can be a barrier to adoption at scale, but Ameelio can be used as a basic replacement for free video calling platforms like Google Meet; in fact, Louisville Metro DOC has made the switch to free communications with Ameelio without any need for legislation, an important precedent to explore. Later on, if desired, the company can also provide the required and regulated scheduling, storage and security services for a fee.</p>
<p>This would come in far, far below quotes from existing providers. That&#8217;s because the entire problem has changed from being a telecoms problem to a tech problem, and &#8220;They aren&#8217;t tech companies,&#8221; Orchingwa said. &#8220;Their products haven&#8217;t changed in two decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, they buy companies to bolt onto their existing services or pay for off the shelf tech like Twilio. So in order to pay for the service in the first place, then provide the state its cut, and still come out ahead, they have to charge as much as the market will bear. And since the market consists of largely disenfranchised incarcerated folks and their families — not exactly the lobbying type — complaints can be written off more or less completely. The result is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/10/prison-visitation-homewav-leak/">poor service</a> at maximum price.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have that pressure,&#8221; said Orchingwa. &#8220;We&#8217;re a lean startup, and we do everything in house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We leverage a lot of open source tech, which is part of why our costs are so low,&#8221; said Saruhashi. &#8220;They use Twilio, we use mediasoup; the only thing we&#8217;re paying for is servers. And we use Kubernetes, so our total cost right now is like $100 a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also done their own hardware, standard Android tablets with custom enclosures that can very easily be provisioned and deployed anywhere there&#8217;s Wi-Fi. Facilities looking to replace landlines love that they can decommission a dozen phones and bring on five dozen tablets, through which both video and audio calls are possible. Video calls must be scheduled and recorded (by Ameelio or another), but audio can be done any time, and having one service and one device do both streamlines things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249690" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249690 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png" alt="Screenshot of Ameelio's prototype education interface." width="1024" height="648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png 1148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ameelio-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2249690" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Ameelio&#8217;s prototype education interface.</p></div></p>
<p>The last area where Ameelio hopes to move things forward is in education. Currently there is a real hodgepodge of education systems available to inmates. Sometimes security requirements mean paper resources or homework must be physically brought and collected by a representative of the school (something we talked about at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/recap-pathways-for-returned-citizens/">TC Sessions: Justice this summer</a>). Some places there is a virtual service, but only accessible at certain times, or with limited topics. As interesting as a course on English Literature might be, not every inmate is interested in completing their BA, possibly preferring to learn a trade.</p>
<p>The same tablets that provide audio and video calls — and of course other services like telehealth, official communications, text-based messaging and so on — would be the platform for education or simply reading. Orchingwa said there is great interest from both sides of the market (educators and DOCs, to say nothing of the inmates themselves, who have fought for this for decades), but that digitization has been a slow process.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are grants available, but no education platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The news is Ameelio is actually doing it, at two facilities and we just signed our first county. LinkedIn Learning, MasterClass, PBS, we&#8217;re uploading thousands of books from Gutenberg. We&#8217;re also trying to do job training; we identified CDL [commercial drivers license] training as being of interest, and we&#8217;ve been running that on the outside with about 50 formerly incarcerated students with computer literacy issues, using the app to study.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INutrlRP8i"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/build-products-that-improve-the-lives-of-inmates/">Build products that improve the lives of inmates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Build products that improve the lives of inmates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/build-products-that-improve-the-lives-of-inmates/embed/#?secret=INutrlRP8i" data-secret="INutrlRP8i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s all still very much on the horizon, but it&#8217;s telling that in the short time since its founding Ameelio has already clawed away numerous facilities from industry incumbents that got their start in the &#8217;80s. This is an industry ripe for change and there are plenty of stakeholders willing to try something new, even if it means rocking the boat a bit.</p>
<p>Although Ameelio does intend to fund itself by acting as the provider for commercial services states already pay for (recording and storing video calls) and by charging attorneys for secure, private calls instead of inmates or families, it will remain free to users. &#8220;Ameelio will always exist as a nonprofit. We are committed to never charging families to communicate with their loved ones and will always keep our services that face incarcerated people as nonprofit. We don&#8217;t believe that a for-profit model that relies on incarcerated people is justifiable,&#8221; Orchingwa said.</p>
<p>It does help to have a few deep-pocketed allies, though. Orchingwa mentioned Jack Dorsey, Vinod Khosla, Eric Schmidt, Brian Acton, Sarah and Rich Barton, Devin and Cindy Wenig, Kevin Ryan and Draper Richards Kaplan as those who are presently supporting Ameelio, and that True Ventures has awarded it grants as well. The company is working on a planned $25 million round to get them through the next few years as they establish their own income streams.</p>
<p>The idea that an incarcerated person could — and should — have a device that lets them communicate securely and even spontaneously with their loved ones and legal representation, as well as access educational resources and other services, seems like a fairly self-evident one. But the market, and the lobbying and industry that define it, have thwarted this path forward for a long time. Ameelio is just now building momentum but in a few years may be the provider of a free (as in beer, as in speech, perhaps even as in FOSS) platform that provides it for this perennially mistreated population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founder and CEO Devo Harris got the idea for Adventr while working with the music industry&#8217;s biggest artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adventr was inspired by my experience creating content for artists like Kanye West, Britney Spears and Nas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The music videos where I introduced interactive components shot up in popularity, proving that engaging viewers was not just about expensive footage and editing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Harris stepped out of his role as a Grammy-winning media executive and into the shoes of an early-stage startup founder. Now, Adventr is a drag-and-drop SaaS tool for creating, viewing and sharing interactive media &#8212; people can interact with the videos through touch screens, clicks and even their voice. Adventr patented this voice-controlled technology, called &#8220;SmartListen,&#8221; which allows media content to change mid-stream based on voice commands. This technology could be applied to advertisements, where a viewer can say something like &#8220;buy the green shirt.&#8221; Or, if a creator made a movie in Adventr, they could invite audience members to tell the characters what to do, like saying &#8220;don&#8217;t go down that hallway!&#8221; to the star of a horror film.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As of now, the patented SmartListen features aren&#8217;t quite ready yet, but Harris said that they will be available for select partners in early 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a game changer and is going to open creators&#8217; minds to the possibilities of connected media beyond clicking in a video,&#8221; Harris told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Adventr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/adventr-uses-patented-voice-control-tech-to-allow-anyone-to-create-interactive-videos/">competed</a> in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt this fall, earning a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021/">top-5 finalist spot</a> only about a year after launch. The company has refined its product in beta, with 8,000 users, including AsiaNet News, MSI Gaming, SK Interactive and the New South Wales government. These companies also can see analytics about how users are interacting with their videos, which offers another way to learn about their consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Disrupt, Adventr raised $5 million in seed funding led by Paladin Capital, along with Reinventure Capital, In/Visible Ventures, and EGOT-winner John Legend, who also happens to be Harris&#8217; longtime collaborator and former college roommate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a six-figure jump in revenue immediately following Disrupt, and to this day we receive inbounds from people who see our pitch video online,&#8221; Harris said.</p>

<p>Adventr plans to use this funding to continue building out its team &#8212; when the company participated in the Startup Battlefield, they only had five employees. The company recently brought on former Vimeo General Manager Peter Gerard as a product lead. Harris said that soon, Adventr will roll out integrations into social media platforms, allowing customers to share their interactive videos natively on those platforms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Overjet is now covering nearly 75 million members through its dental insurance partnerships.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just four months after announcing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overjet-raises-27-million-in-series-a-financing-to-accelerate-adoption-of-ai-driven-dentistry-301363607.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$27 million in Series A funding</a>, <a href="https://www.overjet.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overjet</a>, a company developing dental artificial intelligence software, came forward again with another $42.5 million in Series B financing backed by existing investors.</p>
<p>Prior to the company’s Series A, we profiled them in 2020 when the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/overjet-raises-7-85m-for-its-dental-focused-ai-tech/">$7.85 million in funding</a>. The latest funding was led by General Catalyst and Insight Partners and included Crosslink Capital and E14 Fund. Overall, the company has raised just under $80 million in total. Now even more well capitalized, Overjet’s valuation has nearly quadrupled to $425 million, says Wardah Inam, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Overjet.</p>
<p>“We were valued at $115 million at the last round, so this is a substantial increase,” she added. “For a dental company, not many have reached that milestone yet.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249321" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Overjet raises $7.85M for its dental-focused AI tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/overjet-raises-7-85m-for-its-dental-focused-ai-tech/embed/#?secret=2W2KcdrwmN" data-secret="2W2KcdrwmN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Having just completed a round of funding, Inam told TechCrunch that it was a quick Series B, and though the timing was unexpected, it was the result of much inbound inquiries from investors. New investors showed interest, but the company decided to do the round internally when it was able to get the terms it wanted for the future, she said.</p>
<p>Boston-based Overjet&#8217;s dental AI software supports dentists in understanding what the scans show with regard to disease identification and progression. Its Dental Assist product has FDA clearance and its strategy of targeting dental groups with large numbers of providers, for example its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overjet-and-new-england-family-dentistry-partner-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-over-50-dental-practices-301399523.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership with 50-clinic New England Family Dentistry</a>, announced in October, is keeping the company busy working to implement its software into thousands of practices, Inam said.</p>
<p>On the insurance side, the company counts 16 major carriers as customers. It was covering 50 million members at the time of the Series A, and that figure is now around 75 million, Inam said.</p>
<p>“The raise was to set up practice operations, and now that we have good hires in, we have a huge backlog of practices that we want to launch,” she added. “Milestones that we were planning to hit in a year, we ended up hitting in a few months.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December, Overjet reached 50 employees after starting the year with 20, and Inam expects to triple that headcount in the next six months in the areas of customer success and engineering. It switched to remote-first operations so it could reach a broader range of talent. The company also plans to use the new funding to develop new products.</p>
<p>Next up, the company remains on course with its focus on improving oral health and oral care and building technology. Inam believes that “for the first time ever” the technology is there to analyze dental data through computers and be able to more accurately see the progression of disease and measure outcomes toward more value-based care.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dental industry is one that has been slow to embrace technology, but many startups have emerged in the past decade to assist payers and providers in automating some of the traditionally manual parts of the business, particularly the clear aligner space and analyzing dental scans, and educating people about dental health.</p>
<p>This year, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/y-combinator-backed-adra-wants-to-turn-all-dentists-into-cavity-finding-super-dentists/">Adra</a>, which is turning X-rays into images for better identification of problems, also received funding, as did dental insurer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/beam-raises-80m-as-the-dental-insurer-looks-to-keep-up-rapid-historical-growth/">Beam Dental</a>.</p>
<p>“Dental practices are fast being run more like businesses and they are ready to pay for technology and other tools to help them improve care and revenue,” Inam said. “That’s why more and more good startups are being formed in this space, because everyone underestimates the value of oral health, but now there is an opportunity to really provide greater technology.”</p>
