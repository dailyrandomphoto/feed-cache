										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While software development frameworks make developing software faster and easier than ever, pre-deployment testing gets more and more complex by the day. Over the past decade, <a href="https://testlio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testlio</a> has grown exponentially and positioned itself as an &#8220;Elance for Software Testing.&#8221; In addition to its own team of 150 or so, the company now commands an army of 10,000+ vetted freelance testers across 150 countries around the world. The round of fundraising enables the company to double down on its own software platform for software testing management and further shore up its sales and operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We work with companies that produce digital products. That includes companies like <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, American Express, Fox, Microsoft, Netflix, the NBA, SAP, ViacomCBS and many more. We </span>work with some really, really big companies, and we&#8217;ve become an extended part of their quality organization,&#8221; says Steve Semelsberger, who joined Testlio as its CEO back in 2018. &#8220;We also have offerings that are tuned for early-stage companies, who may have recently raised a Series A round and are looking to better scale their testing and quality capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has closed $12 million in Series B <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">financing. The round was led by <a href="https://springlep.com/">Spring Lake Equity Partners</a> and was oversubscribed. It included participation from Series A co-leads Altos Ventures and Vertex Ventures US. With the round, Jeff Williams, partner at Spring Lake Equity Partners, joins the Testlio board of directors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company wouldn&#8217;t give a precise valuation, but Semelsberger suggests that the valuation for its series B was north of $100 million.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223848" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223848" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2223848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Testlio-CEO_Steve_Semelsberger.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223848" class="wp-caption-text">Testlio&#8217;s CEO Steve Semelsberger. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Testlio</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been profitable for 10 quarters, and actually had 75% of our cash from the Series A round,&#8221; explains Semelsberger, who highlights that the company is aiming to invest heavily in R&amp;D for a while to focus on rapid growth. &#8220;A lot of <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Series B rounds now are really big, and I would consider a $12 million round relatively small. Our strategy here is to keep the total capital into the company less than our revenue run rate. It&#8217;s an interesting way to look at fundraising. But we think</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> this Series B raised can take us, possibly as far as we need to go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Testlio has exceeded a $20 million annualized revenue run rate this year after previously raising only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/testlio-raises-6-25m-to-expand-its-testing-as-a-service-empire/">$7.5 million in seed and Series A capital</a>. The company has increased revenue by 50% and employees by nearly 100% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company makes the case that demand for a more impactful approach to software testing has skyrocketed with the unprecedented proliferation of digital technologies, and that product and engineering teams are under pressure to increase development velocity and deliver exceptionally high-quality user experiences.</p>
<p>As part of the fund-raise, the company carved out a significant pay-out to its existing employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five percent of the round will go &#8212; or has already gone &#8212; to our employees. We decided to allow anybody who had been with us for more than three years to sell a minority part of their vested equity,&#8221; explains Semelsberger. Of course, with the fresh $12 million hitting the bank account, the company is about to go on a hiring spree, and distributing some equity to its existing staff may prove to be a shrewd investment as a recruiting tool. &#8220;The idea came from experiences <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that a number of us have had, where sometimes it does take a while for a company &#8212; especially a company that is as intentional as ours &#8212; to reach liquidity. The way we implemented this is that employees who had been with us for more than three years were able to sell up to 19% of their vested options. The idea was that this would reward people who had been here for a while and also show others who have just joined that Testlio, that the equity is really worth something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In addition to hiring and building out the sales org, the company is planning to invest in its own platform, designed to make complex testing processes easier to manage and resource. The platform is a SaaS solution that enables Testlio&#8217;s customers to receive burstable and efficient testing experiences powered by &#8220;an optimized mix of humans and machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built a testing management platform. Today, our platform team consists of about 50 people, which includes product managers, product designers, designers, engineers, AI, ML, data scientists and so forth,&#8221; explains Semelsberger. &#8220;That team has created a system that manages the workflow of testing itself: test-case test definition, integration between manual and automated testing, and it&#8217;s also very much a logistics management system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Testlio is exactly the kind of company that Spring Lake Equity Partners loves to work with: growing, capital-efficient, innovating effectively and in the middle of a massive market,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Williams, partner at Spring Lake Equity Partners</span>. &#8220;We’ve been impressed by the Testlio team over the last two years that we’ve gotten to know them and we&#8217;re bullish for what’s ahead.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Warehouses and distribution centers are already blanketed in security cameras, but unless someone is actively monitoring them, a lot of the footage goes unexamined. <a href="https://www.voxelsafety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voxel</a> wants to change that by inviting its on-premises pixel-peeping machine-vision robots to take a closer look, notifying managers when something isn&#8217;t up to snuff. The company just raised a $3 million seed round to continue building its tech and rolling out beyond its first set of beta customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mtechcapital.com/">MTech Capital</a> &#8212; a VC fund focusing on insurance tech &#8212; led the funding round, and its insurance focus suggests the direction Voxel has been moving with its technology. The main push is toward reducing workers&#8217; comp and general liability insurance claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are connecting to existing security cameras, and we have a computer that sits on-site. It runs our algorithms looking for things that can lead to injury or high-risk situations for companies. </span>We&#8217;ll detect issues that are precursors to accidents &#8212; anything from protective equipment such as hard hats, safety vests, or safety harnesses when someone&#8217;s elevated,&#8221; explains Alex Senemar, CEO of Voxel. In addition to personal safety equipment, the company&#8217;s tech can detect issues with powered vehicles, like trucks, forklifts and carts. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at powered vehicle safety &#8212; are people speeding, not stopping at intersections, or other types of unsafe behaviors. We&#8217;re also looking at ergonomics risk, which is like a pretty large driver of injuries in the workplace. Anything from lifting, poor lifting form, overreaching. We also detect spills, to prevent slip-and-fall accidents, blocked aisles and vehicles that are parked where they shouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223881" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2223905" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223905" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223905 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png" alt="" width="2880" height="1700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=1536,907 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=2048,1209 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Voxel_Dashboard.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223905" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the Voxel dashboard.</p></div></p>
<p>The company was founded a year ago, and quickly scaled to a staff of 11. The company&#8217;s longer-term vision is to become a &#8220;Risk OS&#8221; for site management. The team suggests that it is particularly focused on behavioral change and site culture, rather than a more punitive approach.</p>
<p>To date, Voxel has had four beta customers, two of whom converted into paying customers. The company&#8217;s pricing plan starts at $50,000 per month per site, which includes the first set of cameras, and goes up from there as a company adds more sites and more cameras to the mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some great initial customers and we started seeing some incredible results, with the impact of the six-month trial periods. The customers started converting, and our goal right now is to get our business to a scaleable place,&#8221; says Senemar. &#8220;At our first site, they were having an injury per month. During the six months of our trial, they had zero. It&#8217;s too early to say that that&#8217;s statistically significant, and we need a lot more of these studies to start showing the value of preventative monitoring, but we are off to an extremely promising start.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company runs a hybrid architecture, where all the initial analysis and computer vision is done by adding an on-premises computer. If a safety event is detected, that is uploaded and made accessible on the SaaS online dashboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Voxel’s technology is a gamechanger in the category of workplace safety, both in monitoring and risk prevention,” said Brian McLoughlin, co-founder and partner at MTech Capital. “We have seen countless workplace safety solutions using wearables and other IoT sensors, but Voxel is the first solution that can drive down insurance costs and improve safety using a company’s existing security camera infrastructure. The customer can see a 360-degree view of the worksite with the ability to spot dangerous conditions and intervene in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suggested to the founder that building a company around a highly litigious market like the U.S. could limit the international expansion possibilities for Voxel in the long run, but the CEO of the company disagreed. &#8220;As things get more litigious, the cost of these things are significantly more. Injuries are pretty expensive in general, but I think there&#8217;s definitely countries where the value prop is much more clear,&#8221; says Senemar, suggesting that countries in Western Europe spend a lot of money in this space too, but more for regulatory reasons rather than due to litigation risk. &#8220;Safety monitoring can often be a reactive and manual process, and it can be difficult to identify the root cause of injuries. In 2019 alone, U.S. employers spent $171 billion on more than 5 million injuries. Our technology gives them a way to prevent these injuries on a scale that would be nearly impossible to do without it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Traditional Web site and app bug bounty platforms, such as HackerOne and BugCrowd, have been successful in that old world model. But there is a massive difference between the existing ‘Web2’ bug bounties and the new era of &#8216;Web3&#8217; bugs associated with blockchains and Crypto. In the era of Decentralised Finance (DeFi), Web3 bug bounties take on the critical nature of being associated with actual monetary value, not just software bugs.</p>
<p>This would perhaps explain why <a href="https://immunefi.com/">Immunefi</a>, one of the emerging bug bounty and security services platforms for DeFi, has now raised $5.5M in funding led by <a href="https://www.electriccapital.com/">Electric Capital</a>. Also participating is Blueprint Forest, Framework Ventures, Bitscale Capital, P2P Capital, IDEO Colab, The LAO, BR Capital, 3rd Prime Ventures, North Island Ventures, and other individual investors. </p>
<p>With DeFi, billions of dollars in user funds are locked in smart contracts, visible and accessible to all. And the stakes are high. In 2020, hackers <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/decentralized-finance-risks-regulation-9351911/">stole</a> about $120 million from DeFi protocols in 15 separate attacks. And the problems are only getting bigger.  Hackers <a href="https://defiyield.app/rekt-database">netted</a> more than $1.7 billion this year. Polygon, which connects Ethereum blockchain networks, paid out $2,000,000 via Immunefi to a whitehat hacker who discovered a vulnerability that had put approximately $850 million of capital at risk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Immunefi says its bug bounty platform for smart contracts and crypto projects enables security researchers to review code, disclose vulnerabilities, and get paid to do so. It also allows companies to access security talent.</p>
<p>Mitchell Amador, Founder, and CEO of Immunefi said: “DeFi is unique because vulnerabilities in code represent a possibility of a direct loss of users’ money. Bug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to find those vulnerabilities in exchange for a reward… We believe that by helping launch such programs on Immunefi, we contribute not only to protecting DeFi projects for today, but also to shaping the tech industry for the future.”</p>
<p>Clients for its platform include Synthetix, Chainlink, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Bancor, Cream Finance, Compound, Alchemix and other projects.</p>
<p>The company says that recently Belt Finance paid out $1,050,000 to a whitehat hacker, via Immunefi, who had discovered a critical vulnerability in its protocol which put more than $10 million of capital at risk.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roy Learner, Principal at Framework Ventures said: “This year, Immunefi succeeded in becoming DeFi’s leading bug bounty platform, gaining the trust of key industry players, and we are confident Immunefi is just getting started.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Amador added: “The reality is that Web3 is a far more adversarial environment, which means every part of the bug bounty process works differently from before, from the submission and processing of a report, to the validation of a report, to the negotiation for a payout. Where traditional web2 bug bounties are a convenient bugfixing tool, our Web3 bug bounties are a far more critical emergency response system for DeFi projects.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In early 2017, Motiv captured the tech press’ imagination by demonstrating how wearable fitness tracking could live beyond the wrist. Ultimately, however, exercise wasn’t enough for the company, which quickly looked to expanding into things like biometric device unlock. For Oura, on the other hand, health has been more than enough.</p>
<p>In fact, the company had a banner 2020, as organizations sought an outside the box solution amid the pandemic. The startup demonstrated how its various health metrics could assist in early detection of COVID-19 and other health conditions, and some of the U.S.’s biggest sports organizations happily lined up, including, NBA, WNBA, World Surf League, USA Surfing + World Surf League, Red Bull Racing, Seattle Mariners, UFC and NASCAR.</p>

<p>Over the course of its life, Oura notes that it has sold “hundreds of thousands” of rings. Not earthshattering numbers in the world of consumer electronics, but an impressive uptick for a hardware startup &#8212; particularly in a market oversaturated with various smartwatches and fitness bands.</p>
<p>Oura has succeeded on the strength of cramming an impressive number of sensors into a discrete package, offering some quality insights into things like workouts and sleep. The new gen-3 ring reaffirms the company’s commitment to its bread and butter &#8212; not surprisingly, of course, in an era when nearly all wearable makers are making a big play for health and wellness.</p>
<p>The top-line feature here is 24/7 health tracking, courtesy, in part, of a daytime/live heart monitoring. Other major features include improved temperature monitoring, better sleep tracking and period prediction. Of the latter, the company writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oura accurately predicts your next period 30 days in advance and alerts you 6 days before it starts, so you’re always prepared. Instead of relying solely on the calendar method, Oura takes a more holistic approach to predicting your period as your body temperature naturally changes throughout your menstrual cycle. While most tracking methods assume your cycle is the same every month, Oura’s Period Prediction adapts its predictions as your cycle changes.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news also finds the company taking a much deeper dip into workout content, joining the likes of Apple, Fitbit and Samsung. Currently listed as “coming soon,” the library will launch with more than 50 video and audio sessions, focused on workouts, meditation, sleep and breathing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223778" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223778" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223778" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="736" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg 2566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1104 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1472 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-4.55.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223778" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Oura</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll keep expanding that library. Both educational content &#8212; understanding the effects of things like caffeine and sleep &#8212; and also guided content,&#8221; CEO Harpreet Rai tells TechCrunch. &#8220;In the beginning, you’ll see a lot of meditation, sleep sounds. We’ve expanded that library tremendously. You’ll see more and more coming there. It’s a one-stop shop for your health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those videos, along with deeper health insight, will be available through a newly launched $6/month Oura Membership service.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at Peloton, Tonal, Tempo, Hydro and all of your connected fitness, it’s hardware plus subscription,&#8221; says Rai. &#8220;You’ve seen wearables go that way, too. Do I think over time, we can go fully subscription model? There may be different ways to finance this stuff &#8212; I think you can. We haven’t ruled it out. But we’ve seen more consumers gravitate toward this, because of the total cost of ownership.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ring will continue to add new features moving forward, including SpO2 blood oxygen sensing, which is set to arrive at some point next year. The ring itself runs $300 and is up for preorder now. It starts shipping mid-November.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based Piiano wants businesses to keep their customers&#8217; data private. The company is coming out of stealth today and announcing a $9 million funding round led by YL Ventures, together with a group of angel investors that include Snyk founder Danny Grander, Armis co-founder Nadir Izrael, Papaya Global co-founder and CEO Eynat Guez, Wiz co-founder Yinon Costica, as well as well-known angel investor Ariel Maislos.</p>
<p>The premise behind Piiano is that data breaches are basically inevitable, so the way to keep user data safe is to ensure that data sets are free of personally identifiable information (PII &#8212; you can see where the company&#8217;s name comes from&#8230;) and to fully pseudonymize customer data. Today&#8217;s approaches to securing this data, the company argues, simply don&#8217;t work. Companies often don&#8217;t know where all of the PII data lives &#8212; which is why so many enterprises invest in visibility tools.</p>
<p>Piiano co-founders Gil Dabah and Ariel Shiftan likened the company&#8217;s approach to how governments handle classified data. They redact the documents and store the original in a safe spot where only a few people have access. Now, if somebody gets access to the redacted document, it&#8217;s simply not that interesting anymore because all of the most important data &#8212; at least for the hacker &#8212; isn&#8217;t in it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223055" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we are trying to do with Piiano is to &#8212; because data breaches are a matter of time &#8212; bring the privacy risk to zero,&#8221; Dabah said. &#8220;And this is the name of the game: it&#8217;s about the privacy because hackers will have a way into your system. Now we need to do something about the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>So on the one hand, Piiano provides tools to pseudonymize data, and on the other hand it provides a safe place to store the original data in a vault where access is restricted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our innovation is to say: &#8216;look, just pseudonymize the data sets, segregate the PIIs into one place where you can actually watch for it and make sure that it&#8217;s safe.&#8217; Then, nobody can come in and just say: &#8216;give me everything,'&#8221; Dabah explained.</p>
<p>The company argues that the tools on the market today are point solutions, while Piiano offers businesses a more comprehensive approach. With that, though, businesses also have to change their technical and cultural approach to privacy. That may make it more difficult for a company to implement its tools, but the team also believes that its service helps developers build privacy and security right into their code instead of having to bolt it on later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Vault, the second piece of Piiano&#8217;s solution, is currently self-hosted inside a business&#8217; cloud. As such, customer data never leaves their systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As computing power increases exponentially, the ability to secure our data against brute force and other types of attacks gets more complicated, with the scale and sophistication of cyberattacks continuing to challenge companies&#8217; ability to implement effective data access control and encryption.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding was led by <a href="https://www.mseq.vc/">Main Sequence</a> and <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/ventures">TELUS Ventures</a>, with participation from Mizuho Financial Group-backed <a href="http://www.intervalley.vc/">InterValley Ventures</a> and Capital Property Group. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QuintessenceLabs will use the Series B funding to expand its customer base, including private and public organizations in financial services, cloud providers, government agencies and defense sectors globally, CEO and founder of QuintessenceLabs <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vikram-sharma-2">Vikram Sharma</a> told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QuintessenceLabs uses quantum physics to build data security tools and has developed qStream, a quantum random number generator (QRNG) that provides encryption keys with full entropy, which means they are truly random, Sharma explained. The market for this type of technology was small when QuintessenceLabs started in 2008, and it took time to mature and bring it to a commercial level, he said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We have spent more than a decade getting the technology right and preparing for commercial adoption,&#8221; Sharma said. </span></p>
<p>The company sells its product to global corporations, Sharma said. In the last year, one of its significant achievements was making the approved products list for a $2 billion program run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, focused on strengthening data protection across participating agencies, Sharma told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Australia-headquartered company opened an office in the U.S. in 2013 with an initial team of three people to make a more significant commitment to the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the U.S. is by far the largest cybersecurity market, QuintessenceLabs will continue to grow its team in the U.S. over the next two to three years, Sharma said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The U.K. is the second-largest cybersecurity market and somewhat similar to Australia in terms of market dynamics, legal systems, and business culture, according to Sharma. In the first half of next year, QuintessenceLabs plans to set up an office in the U.K. that is also an ideal location for its EMEA headquarters, Sharma said, adding that it is in discussions with several U.K. institutions for strategic partnerships. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In parallel, QuintessenceLabs is developing partnerships in Japan and India, Sharma noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QuintessenceLabs deferred its growth plans to 12-15 months due to the uncertainty caused by a global pandemic, Sharma said. The company will implement a planned geographic and sectoral expansion strategy as the world starts to reopen around 2022, he mentioned. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Australia&#8217;s national science agency CSIRO <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/work-with-us/services/consultancy-strategic-advice-services/csiro-futures/futures-reports/quantum">recently released a report on Australia&#8217;s quantum industry</a> in which it forecasts an $86 billion global market size in the quantum industry by 2040. The quantum communications and cybersecurity market is expected to account for about $16 billion globally. Australia&#8217;s quantum technology is projected to generate more than $4 billion in revenues and 16K new jobs by 2040, as per the report. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has 50 employees as of September 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Safeguarding data – our most valuable resource – has never been more critical, and we look forward to this exciting new growth stage,&#8221; said CEO and founder of QuintessenceLabs Vikram Sharma. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As computing power increases exponentially, the tools needed to secure critical data and assets must stay several steps ahead,&#8221; said Bill Bartee, Partner of Main Sequence. &#8220;QuintessenceLabs is a global leader in developing quantum-based cybersecurity tools that help protect sovereign and commercially sensitive business and provide customers with a critical layer of protection.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hivewatch">HiveWatch</a>, an LA-based startup that uses multisensor fusion to help companies better respond to physical security threats, has secured $20 million in Series A funding led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/01-advisors-the-venture-firm-of-dick-costolo-and-adam-bain-has-closed-fund-two-with-325-million/">Dick Costolo and Adam Bain</a>.</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> execs — Costolo as CEO and COO, and Bain served as COO — say HiveWatch resonated with them because of the pain they experienced scaling their own physical security programs.</p>
<p>”When running a company, nothing is more important than your employees. Prioritizing their safety and security is imperative,” says Bain, who along with Costolo is now managing partner at venture and advisory firm 01A. “You spare no expense to do so but, the reality is that software and hardware products serving the enterprise physical security market are woefully inadequate. They’re antiquated, disconnected from each other, and make responding to incidents impossibly slow. When we saw what Ryan was building with HiveWatch, we instantly saw the value and the future of smart physical security.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223999" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>HiveWatch claims its intelligent approach to cybersecurity helps organizations to modernize their physical security. Using sensor fusion (the collection of data from multiple sensors) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a>, the startup’s platform pulls data from a company’s disparate monitoring systems and security sensors to provide operators the information to evaluate and respond to alerts. This, the startup claims, can help organizations to move corporate safety operations from reactive-only responses to designing proactive programs that identify threats before they happen.</p>
<p>“Existing companies who try to solve physical security problems typically fall into two camps: they are either tech-driven or security-driven,” HiveWatch CEO and founder Ryan Schonfeld told TechCrunch. “The technically-inspired companies have leadership that is solely focused on the advancement of technology at all costs, and then there’s the security practitioner-inspired, which are too far from the leading-edge technology or the required talent to execute on the solution.</p>
<p>“HiveWatch’s approach has been to bridge the gap. We’ve brought together incredible technical and security practitioners, not just to build new tech capabilities for security programs, but to collect meaningful data from their sensors and their operational processes so security leaders can constantly improve on their existing installed systems. Failures in program design shouldn&#8217;t be identified after something bad happens. That&#8217;s too late.”</p>
<p>The startup’s Series A investment, which lands less than a year after the startup’s $5 million seed raise, also saw participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lachy-groom/">Lachy Groom</a>, Elad Gil, and Penny Jar Capital, along with early HiveWatch investors Crosscut Ventures, Freestyle Capital, and SaaS Ventures.</p>
<p>Schonfeld, who previously served as a consultant for the U.S. Department of State, says HiveWatch will use the newly raised funds to build a better and more cohesive customer experience and a best-in-class engineering team focused on diversity and inclusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/admix-series-a/">covered</a> Adtech startup <a href="https://admixplay.com/">Admix’s</a> $7 million Series A funding. The London-based company brings ads to games, e-sports, virtual reality, and augmented reality. In-game advertising at scale, where advertisers can bid programmatically through traditional ad-buying platforms, rather than relying on an ad agency model, remains an enormous area, largely under-exploited.</p>
<p>Today Admix is doubling down on this very model, with a $25 million Series B round to scale up its ‘In-Play’ solution and prep it for new platforms like metaverses &#8211; the likes of Facebook and others are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">clearly building</a>.</p>
<p>The new raise brings Admix’s total funding to USD $37 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224038" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round was co-led by Elefund and DIP capital. Also participating is Force Over Mass, Notion Capital, Speedinvest, Rocket Capital, Colopl Next, Sure Valley Ventures, and Sidedoor Ventures as well as growth investor Kuvi Capital and angels from the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Samuel Huber, CEO and Co-founder at Admix, commented:“We see the internet entering a new stage: Web 3.0 or the metaverse, characterized by real-time 3D interactions and a new creator economy, spearheaded by the video games industry&#8230; While many players in our industry are essentially agencies, Admix is building critical infrastructure for creators to monetize their content in the best way possible.”</p>
<p>Serik Kaldykulov, Founder and Managing Partner at Elefund, commented: “Sam and Joe are exactly the type of founders we want to work with at Elefund. They created Admix and In-Play with their incredible vision for the future of digital gaming, and we believe that they will continue to play a significant role in shaping how consumers and businesses exist and interact in what the world will come to know as the metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaborating, Huber told me that companies in the same space include Bidstack, Adverty, Anzu and Frameplay. However, he said the difference with these entities is that Admix is “building infrastructure to automate the process and serve non-intrusive ads to the right user in the right game at the right time, using data. This tech means scalability (across 300+ games and hundred of advertisers we worked with in the last 2 years, 90% are self onboarded) and network effects defensibility, which is why VCs are betting on us to dominate the category.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Admix recently signed deals for In-Play campaigns with Calvin Klein, Schuh, Movember, and Sky.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last few years, Adobe has gone all-in on AI. At its MAX conference this year, that&#8217;s once again on full display across updates for virtually all of its products, powered by its Sensei AI platform. Those range from smarter masking tools and preset recommendations in Lightroom to the ability to transfer colors between images in Photoshop, all the way to a body tracker in Character Animator.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked with Photoshop, you know the pain of trying to precisely select an object in order to then manipulate it. Using the &#8220;magic wand,&#8221; after all, often felt anything but magical. Last year, Adobe added the object selection tool, which uses AI to help you with that. Now, with the latest update, Adobe is also introducing auto-masking, which takes this one step further by automatically recognizing the different objects in an image. Adobe is quite open about the fact that it won&#8217;t detect everything just yet, but the company also notes that this feature will improve over time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223387" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Auto-Mask_GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223387" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Auto-Mask_GIF.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="677" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Similarly, last year, Adobe introduced what it calls &#8220;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/neural-filters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neural filters</a>.&#8221; These added the ability to colorize an old black and white image, improve portraits, add depth blur or zoom into an image, with the neural network automatically trying to recreate all of the details.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223389" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223389" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223389" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png" alt="" width="1024" height="928" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png 3310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=768,696 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=680,616 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=1536,1392 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=2048,1856 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Photoshop_Neural-Filter-Harmonization.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>This year, it is introdu0cing a feature called &#8220;landscape mixer.&#8221; By moving a few sliders, you can make your photo look like it was taken in the fall or winter, for example, either using a set of presets or by creating your own custom ones. Say there&#8217;s a bit of a drab foreground but you want a green image; find yourself an image with a verdant green landscape to transfer that style and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223396" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/landscape_mixer.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223396" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223396" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/landscape_mixer.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223396" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also, depth blur, which was previously available, now lets you change your focal distance after the fact, which looks quite a bit more professional than the previous filter, which mostly focused on blurring everything around an object in an image.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Lightroom, photo editors can now use a new feature to automatically select the sky (and invert that to select everything else, too). Also new in Lightroom, though not AI-related, is a new Remix tab in the Discover section that allows photographers to share their work and lets others see the edits they made &#8212; and maybe make some changes to it.</p>
<p>For videographers, Adobe is adding a new AI feature to Premiere Pro that can automatically adjust the length of a music clip to the length of a video sequence. First introduced in Adobe Audition, the audio editor in the Creative Cloud suite, this new feature (somewhat confusingly also called &#8220;Remix&#8221;), makes sure that you don&#8217;t just fade out in the middle of a song when a sequence is over. It automatically cuts the audio so the end of the song is still there at the end of the sequence when you shorten a music clip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223408" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223408" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223408" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg 3990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=2048,1116 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Premiere-Pro_SimplifySequence.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Among some of the other updates to Creative Cloud are Creative Cloud Web, a new hub to access, organize and share files and libraries on the web. It&#8217;s still a private beta and will only be available in Fresco, Illustrator, XD and Photoshop. It&#8217;ll feature a real-time collaboration space where teams can add text, stickers and images to assets. It&#8217;s worth noting that this isn&#8217;t Photoshop or XD on the web. It&#8217;s merely a place to discuss projects and assets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223003" style="width: 830px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223003" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg" alt="" width="820" height="871" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg 820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg?resize=282,300 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg?resize=768,816 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg?resize=640,680 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop_illustrator_web.jpg?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223003" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t despair, because Photoshop and Illustrator on the web are also getting support for some basic editing tools in the browser.</p>
<p>As usual, there are also a slew of other updates to all of the Creative Cloud tools. What&#8217;s clear, though, is that Adobe is betting big on AI to make life easier for creative professionals and hobbyists. In some respects, it is catching up to competitors like Skylum&#8217;s <a href="https://skylum.com/luminar-ai-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luminar AI</a>, which have made AI the central focus of their applications. Adobe&#8217;s advantage is the breadth of its feature set, though, which is going to be hard to replicate for any newcomer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I just pulled my iPhone off my Qi charger and tossed on the new Kindle. Honestly, not a sentence I ever expected to write. I realize this isn’t an exciting sentiment &#8212; certainly not in 2021 &#8212; but let’s face it, the pace of e-reader innovation is downright glacial compared to the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>This is due, in no small part, to the fact that the competition has dwindled. Formerly big players like Sony long ago abandoned ship, and while Barnes &amp; Noble is ostensibly still in the Nook business, whatever glory days it might have had are long behind it. For big players, that pretty much leaves Kobo, which is still kicking, and, of course, Amazon.</p>
<p>And let’s be real &#8212; in terms of major scale and presence here in the U.S., well, that pretty much leaves Amazon. Like so many things it has touched, the retail giant dominates the category. That’s helped along by its overwhelming presence in the publishing industry and having one of the world’s best online billboards in its home page. It’s also not hurt by the fact that the company, on the whole, produces nice e-reader hardware.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2223710" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223710" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223710" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0626.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223710" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Limited competition in the category means that we’ll probably never again see a heated race for manufacturers to one-up one another. In other words, don’t expect to see something akin to the smartphone wars &#8212; or even the kind of competition we saw in the category, say, 10 years ago.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’s genuinely exciting when a new Kindle drops. It feels like this category still has a bit of life in it yet. The line long ago took a backseat to products like the Echo and Fire TV, and on a good year, we get one new Kindle a year.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite was announced late last month, bringing with it a few features that blurred the line between it and the high-end Oasis, as well as some genuine surprises. Wireless charging (which, mind, is only available on the “Signature Edition” for an extra $50) and USB-C firmly fit in the latter category. It’s, honestly, genuinely strange to see a new port on the bottom of this device after so many generations of microUSB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2223711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223711" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0629.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223711" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Along with USB-C comes faster charging, topping the device up in around two-and-a-half hours (3.5 for wireless). Really, though, the main benefit here for me is that it means carrying around one less cable when I travel. The Kindle was one of the last microUSB holdouts in my regular stable of devices. Of course, that point is rendered somewhat moot by the battery life on these things. The new Paperwhite is currently rated at 10 weeks of battery life (with wireless off and 30 minutes of reading a day).</p>
<p>That’s up from six weeks, which, as far as gadget batteries go, is still very good. It’s one of the few consumer devices where you’re talking weeks, rather than days or even hours. That highlights the general strangeness around the fact that so many of the feature updates on these things tend to focus on battery and charging &#8212; though additions like audio books through Bluetooth audio certainly put more of a strain on the battery than standard reading.</p>

<p>The new Paperwhite looks a fair bit like its predecessors at first glance, though like the Oasis before it, the bezels and display are now flush, adding to an already solid build. Overall, it still doesn’t feel as premium as the $250 Oasis, however, dropping that model’s metal backing and physical page buttons &#8212; the latter of which is a nice luxury I do actually miss here.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there’s not a lot of difference in the screens. Both have a 300 ppi resolution (same as last gen), significantly more than the standard Kindle’s 167. The new model increases size slightly from 6.6 to 6.8 inches &#8212; just a hair below the Oasis’ seven. Both models have IPX8 waterproofing, as well &#8212; always nice for those who like to read near the pool, tub or any body of water.</p>
<p>The Oasis still wins out on front lighting, with 25 to the Paperwhite’s 17 (owing, at least in part, to a smaller screen), though the lighting is uniform and does a fine job when reading in the dark. The system gets the color temperature adjust introduced in the 2019 Oasis &#8212; a feature that reduces blue lighting on a schedule, which can be detrimental to your sleep patterns. An ambient light sensor to adjust brightness is only available on the Signature edition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223708" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223708" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223708" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0623.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223708" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>On-board storage is the other major difference between the standard Paperwhite and Signature Edition, bumping things up from 8 to 32GB. Those are the two things I’d miss most, bumping it down to the standard edition &#8212; I’d say wireless charging is superfluous for most people most of the time on an e-reader and certainly not enough to justify the price gap between $140 and $190. That’s doubly the case knowing that the $30 charging dock is sold separately (my Anker phone charger works fine, thanks).</p>
<p>All in all, lots of welcome additions here. If you have a 2018 Paperwhite, it’s probably not worth the upgrade, but if you’re looking for a well-rounded e-reader, this is probably the one. The new features blur the lines between the premium Oasis. That $250 has a more premium look and feel, but for a majority of readers, the new Paperwhite makes a lot more sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe is launching new tools in beta today to help creatives ensure that their work isn&#8217;t stolen and for the public to see how images were created (and potentially manipulated). The company, together with a set of partners, first launched its <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> two years ago. Today&#8217;s work expands on this mission to preserve provenance and attribution data for digital content in order to combat misinformation and brings it directly into PhotoShop.</p>
<p>Specifically, Adobe is launching what it calls &#8216;content credentials.&#8217; This includes an opt-in feature in Photoshop that cryptographically signs the metadata and edit history of content credentials-enabled images, as well as the automatic download of content credentials from Adobe Stock, the company&#8217;s stock imagery service. As you edit photos in Photoshop, the application will automatically update the edit history &#8212; including the use of AI tools &#8212; and a list of assets you used to create your images in the background.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223008" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223008" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223008" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="737" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg 1187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg?resize=768,553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/content-credentials.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223008" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223006" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Creatives can also link their social media profiles to crypto wallet addresses from within Photoshop and connect their wallets to Behance, for example.</p>
<p>For consumers, Adobe is now making it easier to see content credentials thanks to its new <a href="https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/inspect">Verify site</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">MAX conference</a>, Adobe today announced a number of interesting updates to its <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> portfolio site for creatives. According to Adobe over 160 million people visited the site in the last year and viewed the work of the creatives on the site over 2.25 billion times. That&#8217;s a highly active community and it&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that the company is adding a number of new features that will allow its users to directly &#8212; and indirectly &#8212; profit from this.</p>
<p>Maybe the most headline-grabbing feature Adobe is adding is the ability to better showcase NFT artwork on the site. Creatives can now connect their crypto wallets with Behance. The company is working to include blockchains like Polygon, Solana, Flow and Tezos. It is also partnering with NFT marketplaces like <span class="s1"><a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a></span><span class="s2">, <a href="https://superrare.com/"><span class="s1">SuperRare</span></a>, <a href="https://knownorigin.io/"><span class="s1">KnownOrigin</span></a>, and <a href="https://rarible.com/"><span class="s1">Rarible</span></a> to display provenance data from the Content Authenticity Initiative &#8212; which is now built into a number of Creative Cloud tools &#8212; visible on their sites, in addition to Behance.</span></p>
<p>Will Allen, the Adobe VP in charge of Behance (among other things), noted that Adobe isn&#8217;t interested in creating its own NFT marketplace. &#8220;We&#8217;re really just focused on enabling these creators to showcase their work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the key focus of what I think we can do particularly well as allow them to showcase their work and then make these transactions wherever they want to be.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223684" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2223753" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223753" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223753" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Behance_Creator-Subscriptions-Source-Files-in-Livestreams.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223753" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>As Allen told me, a lot of Behance users are subscribing to fellow creatives to learn. &#8220;I do find a common theme is that they want to learn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want to seebehind the scenes of like, &#8216;Hey, this is a phenomenal illustrator, let me just watch them create and see how to do these things. Let me get access to their PSDs, so I use those as a template and take my creativity to the next level.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Creatives can now also sell subscriptions on Behance to sell access to their tutorials, workshops and live streams. Creatives can set their own prices for these subscriptions and Adobe tells me that it doesn&#8217;t take any commission from those sales.</p>
<p>Also new on Behance is the ability to indicate that somebody is available for work. Finding job opportunities has always been the goal of many Behance users, but with the help of a new button, creatives can now make this explicit. Creatives can indicate whether they are available for freelance or full-time work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eight years ago, Nike decided it was time to expand the Nike Sports Research Lab (NSRL), which was housed in the Mia Hamm building across company headquarters.</p>
<p>Now a full five times the size of its former self, the NSRL, which occupies the top floor of the brand-new LeBron James Innovation Center, is big enough to allow collaboration among athletes, researchers and innovators as they develop the products we wear every day.</p>
<p>Studying soccer stars like Megan Rapinoe and the world’s fastest marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge &#8212; for everything from the differences in millimeters between each of their feet to the amount of force projected every time their feet touch the ground &#8212; helps researchers develop guidelines that help creators design apparel and footwear to enhance performance. Athletes also train with the support of Nike scientists in order to learn more about themselves and their bodies to benefit their performance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222909" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the NSRL is not just for the world’s elite athletes; it’s for those who play pick-up basketball games on concrete courts in city parks, neighborhood runners and expectant and new parents like those highlighted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-5MGkUwe6w">Nike’s “The Toughest Athlete” film</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Nurse, vice president of the Nike Explore Team Sport Research Lab, says there are times Nike tries to pursue a deeper understanding more quickly.</p>
<p>“The other type of science is this big data, observational stuff using machine learning or AI to start to understand lots of different inventions for movement.”</p>
<p>He says 80% to 85% of the people who come through the lab are everyday athletes from different backgrounds with diverse body types. With a plan to bring thousands of active bodies through the door, Nike can increase the learnings and the speed of development with the new space.</p>
<p>Nike recently invited members of the media to experience firsthand how athletes, researchers and innovators interact to develop Nike products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222915" style="width: 2616px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222915" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2222915 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg" alt="Entrance to the LeBron James Innovation Center" width="2606" height="1466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg 2606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2606px) 100vw, 2606px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222915" class="wp-caption-text">Entrance to the LeBron James Innovation Center. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rae Witte / Composite: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The entranceway of the 750,000-square-foot LeBron James Innovation Center sets the tone for Nike’s commitment, nearly a decade in the making, to utilizing data and design for innovation.</p>
<p>Every one of James’ shot attempts that led to his 30,000 professional career points is mapped on the polished concrete floor in front of a golden hoop. Shots are differentiated by golden dots and empty zeros, representative of points made and missed. Milestone moments are highlighted with larger captioned markers on the floor, including his first made shot and his 20,000th point.</p>
<p>Above the main floor are the apparel and footwear prototypes: Designers and creators occupy spaces with robotics and 3D printers, as well as knit, textile and embroidery sections. There is even a replica of the Winnebago that Nike co-founder Phil Knight traveled to track meets in. Once there, he&#8217;d pass out the earliest iterations of Nike footwear in order to get feedback from the athletes.</p>
<p>The 84,000-square-foot NSRL occupies the top floor of the building and is where researchers and athletes come together to develop Nike footwear and attire. The NSRL includes a full-size, NBA regulation court, a 200-meter track, climate chambers and artificial training turf. These areas contain a combination of 92 force plates, 400 motion capture cameras and 80 prototyping machines.</p>
<p>Force plates, which Nurse describes as glorified bathroom scales, are located beneath the surface of the track, turf and basketball courts. Unlike the typical bathroom scale that offers one reading when you step on it, he says, “these measure tens of thousands of times a second in three dimensions. So not just straight up and down but side to side, back and front.”</p>
<p>For example, for a runner on the track, they’d be able to measure the force with which the foot is connecting and pushing off the ground.</p>
<p>The additional space in the NSRL allows for more fluid and less restricted gameplay and movement.</p>
<p>“One of the goals here is to allow athletes to come in full speed, full motion and also [in] continuous play,” Nurse said. “Sometimes in small facilities, the movements become choreographed, and that’s it. Now, we can have people come in and play.”</p>
<h2>Sweating in the lab</h2>
<p>To inform researchers how all of the tools within the space are leveraged for controlled experimentation and observational big data collection, Nurse said they try to understand three pillars of the triangle: “What’s the dose, what’s the behavior and what’s the response. If we have the dose, response and behavior, a prototype has to give us enough information to do that. We think it’s a solution to look for problems.”</p>
<p>On our tour of the lab, we underwent some of the same testing that Nike designed for its athletes, which included work on the basketball court, track and turf and in the treadmill bays.</p>
<p>We started with a collection of baseline data: a full body scan to determine optimal Nike apparel fit; morphological body size tracking and skeletal and muscular asymmetries; a separate, three-dimensional scan of my feet and ankles; and a barefoot walking pressure test before the Applied Performance Innovation Treadmill. I chose a comfortable speed for a jog and was instructed to run for two to three minutes while they recorded it for analysis.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JRnTIUh5Qo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Researchers can provide observations on form, such as whether athletes are too bouncy, run on their toes or lean forward too much.</p>
<p>They can also make functional recommendations. For example, a runner who leans forward too much may need to strengthen their glutes or hamstrings for a more efficient gait.</p>
<p>Based on what they know biomechanically and through their algorithm development to understand products and athletes, using this testing combined with the baseline data, researchers can make footwear recommendations for optimal efficiency &#8212; whether that’s running faster, longer and/or with less stress on the body.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHTkMwqiLmk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2>The track</h2>
<p>The track itself surrounds both the turf and the basketball court, and it features force plates and motion capture cameras that can be utilized for long runs or more segmented testing, such as starts. An LED Rabbit or pacer offers another layer of control to experiments, and there’s a 100-meter concrete strip to simulate running outdoors.</p>
<p>On the track I was able to test out two different footwear options. Their Infinity Reacts are meant for protection, lower stress on the body and stability. I was able to make it around the track at a comfortable rate in front of the Nike Run Club average runner’s mile pace of 11:37 and well behind sub-2-hour marathoner Eliud Kipchoge’s pace, as indicated by a glowing green LED pacer that spun around the track all day.</p>
<p>However, when I attempted to do a lap with the elite runner’s race shoe of choice, the ZoomX Invincible, we discovered that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/how-nike-is-making-footwear-to-improve-athletes-efficiency-for-the-tokyo-olympics/">the cushion system</a> &#8212; made to be super lightweight with a carbon plate within their exaggerated foam and air system sole &#8212; was not a match for the mechanics of my feet.</p>
<p>The construction, which lends optimal efficiency for some, afforded me &#8212; admittedly a non-runner despite finding I have decent form &#8212; and my very narrow feet, previously injured ankle and flexible (or what I think are loose or weak) ankles a very unstable running experience. I didn&#8217;t even complete the 200-meter lap.</p>

<p>This is where the range of athletes is so crucial. Studying a runner like Kipchoge is incredibly valuable. Because he is so physically efficient, he doesn’t need five hours to complete a marathon and so hasn’t ever run that long. But the global average marathon runner clocks in somewhere between 4 hours and 20 minutes to 4 hours and 40 minutes.</p>
<p>This wide range of data collection will inform footwear innovations through multiple sets of shoes, enabling Nike to develop running shoes appropriate for any runner, whether they’re an elite marathoner or a casual jogger.</p>
<h2>The turf</h2>
<p>The Turf Lab boasts the largest data capture volume in the NSRL and what Nike says may be the largest in the world. Here, force plates below the surface monitor game play and more controlled experiments, allowing researchers to collect data on up to 22 players &#8212; the amount on a soccer field during gameplay &#8212; who are moving at different speeds and directions while interacting with each other, the turf, the cleats and the ball. The turf also has a screen where targets can be projected and accuracy can be recorded for shooting and passing.</p>
<p>Two things Nike specifically focuses on for soccer players’ footwear are functionally very different — the sole for traction and the type of movement the upper requires for dribbling, passing and kicking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222913" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222913" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222913" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg" alt="Man simulating a shot at goal in the Nike Sport Research Lab" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222913" class="wp-caption-text">Simulating a shot at a goal in the Nike Sport Research Lab. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nike</p></div></p>
<p>The 200 cameras surrounding the area capture submillimeter movement, and below the turf are 15 force plates. By measuring an athlete’s movement in a controlled environment, researchers can drill down into the tiniest changes to make for perform<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ance and for protection, and a lot of the findings can apply to other field sports like baseball, football and rugby.</span></p>
<p>During the soccer test, I simulated the opportunity to take a shot on goal. This included a shuttle run as if I were tackling a defender, running around a defender and then taking the shot at a target projected on a screen within the goal.</p>
<p>In this simulation, they captured the forces when I was cutting back, the timing and agility throughout the route, the timing of my decision-making upon the appearance of the target and the accuracy of the ball with respect to the target.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/981RNphxzBo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The results of this test will speak to the size of the athlete, how explosive they are and how quickly they can push off the force plate beneath them. The power, in addition to the traction of the footwear, translates into the speed of their movement. If the traction were to be insufficient, the same level of force would result in a slower speed.</p>
<p>A shoe with really good traction but poor containment, afforded by the shoes’ upper, will result in the foot sliding within the shoe, because while the footwear is interacting with the ground efficiently, the foot is not.</p>
<p>By contrast, an upper providing good containment and poor traction will fit the foot, but will result in the shoe sliding on the ground. The data allows for alterations like these to be made to the footwear.</p>
<h2>The basketball court</h2>
<p>The force plates beneath the neighboring basketball court capture similar data for basketball players.</p>
<p>Fully surrounded by motion capture cameras, players wear sensors that track their heart rates and the speed of their movements on the court, which can be projected in real time on a large screen on the wall. In addition to those, a force plate with a 4K camera below it is under the hoop and can record the way in which a sneaker sole interacts with the floor.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AGy7fRYNlg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Coupled with the motion sensor tracking data throughout the drill, depending on the stiffness of the sneaker or the thickness of the sole, they can track how speed is affected by the footwear, and observe and see the sole’s connection to the floor all while the sensor tracks the athlete’s heart rate throughout the movements.</p>
<p>Another camera in the hoop records the position of the ball as it goes through. The data collected from these shots provide suggestions on functional adjustments that result in a more consistent and efficient shot going through the hoop.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222918,2222924,2222919,2222920,2222921,2222922,2222923"]</p>
<h2>The climate chambers</h2>
<p>Understanding moisture management needs between different wearers offers designers guidelines to create more functional clothing. We toured two climate chambers, one hot and the other cold, that can regulate temperature from -20 to over 50 degrees Celsius; humidity from 10%-90%; control wind speed; and simulate the radiant heat of the sun using two different types of bulbs that match the spectral outlet of the sun’s rays.</p>
<p>The chambers can be set to such precision that their hot tank on the day we visited was set to 34 degrees Celsius and 70% humidity — the exact weather conditions on August 6 in Tokyo during this summer’s Olympic Games where some staff and athletes had to be treated for heat exhaustion.</p>
<p>Leveraging the climate chambers allows Nike to evaluate how different apparel designs or zoning of features can have the biggest impact on making garments more breathable.</p>
<p>Because sweating helps to regulate body temperature, the hot chamber is used to study sweating responses in consumers and how they vary based on sex, age and body size.</p>
<p>They showed us their Vapor Match Men’s Soccer jersey, pointing out where the changes in the knit were zoned to the most condensed perspiration areas, which can be seen in the third image <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/us-2020-vapor-match-home-mens-soccer-jersey-vXDRHv">here</a>.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Nike NSRL <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/nsrl-womens-transform-jacket-fKht8V/DB0820-010?nikemt=true&amp;cp=96413943330_search_%7cPRODUCT_GROUP%7cGOOGLE%7c71700000041489782%7cAll_X_X_X_X-Device_X_Nike-Clearance_X%7c%7cc&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqeWKBhBFEiwABo_XBk_BWWwhwp6j2ssabp7D6IB_8vMfkX92NE9i43d0_5FSk-a5yLVlDhoCKRYQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Transform Jacket</a> exhibits the manifestation of the different thermal needs for an outside run. Sleeves that zip off and tuck into chambers on the back of the jacket and removable down fill accommodates the transition from stepping outside to plateau. They’ve found that the day-to-day runner averages about 5 kilometers per run, and the biggest shift in their insulation needs is between start and 2.5 to 3 kilometers. After that, it regulates for the remainder of the exercise, which is also the case for those running beyond 5 kilometers.</p>
<p>Finally, they have thermal mannequins — that sweat! — in order to test zoning features without having to put stress on human bodies. Between the climate control and the bodies to test on that never tire, they’re able to give design teams even more to work with.</p>
<h2>The cool down</h2>
<p>We hear a lot about mental toughness in the world of sport, so it makes sense Nike would want to understand the minds of their athletes, too, particularly as they impact performance.</p>
<p>Studies and recovery at NSRL go far beyond massage, acupuncture and other bodily needs of rest and maintenance that are available in the lab. They’re also taking into account their subjects’ mental state.</p>
<p>Mental health has become a factor in discussions about elite athletes in the media, whether it’s Naomi Osaka opting out of press conferences or Simone Biles being open about her need to sit out the women&#8217;s all-around final at the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Before taking my baseline measurements, they gave me a cognitive assessment, and at the close of the day, we went through the learnings. Surprisingly (and probably by design), the assessment translates easily between both athletes in regard to sports as it does everyday human behavior.</p>
<p>In pointing out how uncertainty is often so much greater than certainty, the team discussed decision-making and how different results could point to whether an athlete is more prone to decision-making from a place of loss prevention or risk aversion.</p>
<p>These findings can similarly be applied to cognitive recommendations, much like the form or functional recommendations other tests offered. Not only are they trying to create better apparel and footwear, the lab is committed to furthering all aspects of athletes&#8217; abilities.</p>
<p>For example, an athlete struggling with a need for control can try to focus less on the outcome itself and more on the fact that the outcome can be leveraged as an opportunity to benefit future competitions or even process. Similarly, rather than dwelling on a moment or missed shot, sport psychologists will recommend employing mental imagery or visualizing the positive outcome for the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new LeBron James Innovation Center will aid in athletes&#8217; well-being and progress as much as it will afford faster innovations of Nike’s apparel and shoes.</p>
<p>As everything is approached with steps to greater opportunities rather than ticking problems off a list with the entire team in one building, it will be incredible to see what the future holds for the space and its output.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is now profitable and grew over 300% in revenue last year. It now serves over 50,000 customers and makes more than 1.5 million deliveries a month.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anyone purchasing something online has had that one instance where the delivery method failed. <a href="https://americasmi.com/insights/latin-america-e-commerce-market-projections-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Across Latin America, e-commerce purchases</a> are expected to grow by double-digits annually by 2024. That means finding trustworthy — and cost effective — ways to deliver those packages will become more important.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.skydropx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skydropx</a>, a Mexico City-based logistics management company that enables businesses to create an end-to-end automated delivery experience for customers that includes over 250 shipping options, track notifications via WhatsApp, estimated delivery times and return management.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223768" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223768" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223768" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?w=680" alt="Skydropx" width="680" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg 2491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1050 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1400 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223768" class="wp-caption-text">Skydropx team</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Tavo Zambrano, Armando Solbes, Óscar Victorín and Daniel Alvarado, the company is able to provide up to 70% reduction in logistics expenses, a revenue growth of up to 3 times by being able to displace shipping options and costs in real time and up to 91% optimization of a company’s operations by avoiding data errors, Zambrano told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company started out in food delivery, but pivoted in 2015 when Zambrano saw an opportunity to help businesses decipher which is the best shipping carrier.</p>
<p>“We saw them struggling to understand the hundreds of carriers, which one is the best option, which one is the most cost efficient or which one has the best speed,” he added. “We noticed no one was attacking this problem online.”</p>
<p>Every country has its unique challenges when it comes to shipping, Zambrano said. This is due mainly to delivery carriers being different in each country, meaning Skydropx has to start from the ground up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company intends to expand into other countries where e-commerce is growing, including Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru. To do this, the company announced Tuesday $20 million in Series A funding co-led by Base10 Partners, Cometa, and 645 Ventures.</p>
<p>TJ Nahigian, co-founder and managing partner of Base10 Partners, said he met Zambrano and Solbes in 2018 when the ecosystem was still early. He revisited the company as he saw a massive uptick in e-commerce globally, which was also impacting adoption in Latin America, where he said delivery and fulfillment were among the challenges that businesses have to overcome.</p>
<p>“Tavo and Armando are key enablers to grow this ecosystem broadly which is a huge opportunity,” Nahigian said “Skysdropx is at a scale to enable delivery and information to flow through the entire system and in a way that is more efficient. The penetration rate is still small, but we see that significantly change 10 to 100 times over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>This new capital combines with previous raises of $7 million following Skydropx’s participation in Y Combinator in 2018.</p>

<p>Since then, the company became profitable, growing over 300% in 2020 alone. It now serves over 50,000 customers and makes more than 1.5 million deliveries a month. Approximately 6% of package deliveries in Mexico are done through Skydropx, Zambrano said.</p>
<p>In addition to moving into other countries, the company is looking at other verticals in fulfillment, like opening its own fulfillment centers in Mexico and launching its own delivery branches so that in addition to the website, customers can drop off or pick up packages in person. He expects 30 branches to go up in the next two weeks in corner and convenience stores around Mexico.</p>
<p>Aaron Holliday, co-founder and managing partner of 645 Ventures, met the company at Y Combinator, though the firm did not initially invest. He, too, saw the company exceeding its target year over year, and wanted to be involved in the Series A, which is 645 Ventures’ first investment in Latin America.</p>
<p>“In Latin America, e-commerce is undergoing a Renaissance, first around fintech and now with the emergence and surge in e-commerce,” he said. “Customers talked about their product being essential to scale and get to profitability, and Skydropx is emerging as the dominant leader to automate fulfillment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYSE-listed e-commerce platform</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jumias-q2-results-show-moderate-growth-rising-spend-and-continued-losses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a shift in shopping habits across its markets in Africa last year, as more shoppers bought everyday products as opposed to electronics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping for essentials such as foodstuff, fashion and beauty products, saw Jumia’s total sales value of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods grow by 13 percentage points last year from 44% in 2019, according to the newly released Jumia Africa E-commerce Index 2021</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-05cA8GeoxD0pSbiTVD5CSQIe7EjmoyD/view"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jumia report attributed the shift to stay-at-home restrictions that fueled the need for online shopping as well as the youthful population and the increasing smartphone and internet penetration across the continent.  Smartphones contributed 75% of the traffic to the e-commerce site.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By providing consumers with access to essential food and services, we have seen a shift to essential related products from phones and electronics. This goes to show how Covid-19 also reinforced the relevance of e-commerce in the communities we serve,” Jumia Group’s head of communication and public relations, Abdesslam Benzitouni told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia said that more sellers signed up to Jumia Mall – a platform for official brands within the main site – increasing the shopping options and providing a wide variety of products. Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Africa, leading hundreds others including Chinese-owned Kilimall, Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s Bidorbuy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The brands (on Jumia Mall) know e-commerce is the future. Having them on Jumia means that consumers have access to their products, and that brands are within their reach. Different sellers on the platform also means that we create transparency and competition between brands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, prepared in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, International Finance Corporation, and Mastercard, also showed that 28 million orders were made on the platform last year. Lagos, Cairo and Nairobi cities accounted for the most orders by volume, respectively. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 35% of orders made through Jumia were paid using the company’s finance arm, Jumia Pay, an app that allows customers to pay utility bills and make orders without leaving the company’s platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popularity of the Jumia brand also grew in all its markets with Uganda, Senegal and Tunisia experiencing the greatest growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia attributed the growth currently happening within the continent’s e-commerce sector to the increasing, albeit sluggish, penetration of the internet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy</span><a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is expected to grow to about 40% of the population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Jumia. But e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commerce uptake in Africa remains low, according to a recent International Trade Centre (ITC) report, with only 10 countries accounting for 94% of online business. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya accounted for most online sales in sub-Saharan Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…the digital and economic infrastructure in Africa greatly affects e-commerce and helps explain why the online economy works better in some countries than in others,” said the ITC report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Furthermore, more than half of the people in 60% of African countries live in rural areas. Internet connectivity tends to be poor in these areas, which are also far from distribution centers — meaning that delivery services for goods are either poor, non-existent or costly. All of this creates sizable obstacles for e-commerce,” it said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When compared to cities, rural areas accounted for 22% of the orders lodged on the Jumia site, which Benzitouni attributed to the e-commerce’s growing logistics network. He said that Jumia has over the last nine years built a logistics network that targets to make it possible for people in remote areas to shop on its site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia plans to use its logistics network to tap rural areas – which the firm says has seen a strong demand for its services in those areas. The e-commerce platform opened up its logistics marketplace to third parties, a place that was previously only used by food vendors and for e-commerce.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now has 300 logistics partners and 1,600 pick-up stations spread across its 11 markets in Africa, including Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria and Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By last year Jumia had about 110,000 annual sellers and 6.8 million active customers, a small number when compared to the continent’s population. The growth of e-commerce across the continent, the ITC report said, is hampered by the lack of cross-border opportunities as most platforms operate within national borders. It said that the opportunity exists for a marketplace that can have a significant pan-African presence.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you had asked me the other week which consumer electronics companies have yet to get into the wireless earbud business, I probably would have stared at you blankly for a while. Over the past few years, it seems like everyone has launched at least one pair of Bluetooth buds. There was, however, at least one hold out.</p>
<p>Remember Palm? Or, more specifically, remember when TCL heloed launched a Palm rebrand, back in 2018? It arrived alongside an “ultra-mobile” device that was, at the very least, a novel addition to a world of look-alike phones. And, hey, it won the approval (and funding) of Splash Brother, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/palm-returns-as-an-ultra-mobile-smartphone/">Stephen Curry</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223823" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="585" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1170 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223823" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Palm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>No word yet on whether we’ll be getting an update to the Palm PDA (pretty darn adorable), but the brand announced today that it too is getting into the fully wireless earbud game with the Palm Buds Pro.</p>
<p>The $129 buds (with a limited-time $99 price tag) most closely resemble a more aerodynamic pair of black AirPods. As the company notes, the rebranded firm has employed designers from Beats by Dre and Samsung for the new buds, which have “studio grade audio and enhanced bass” along with active noise canceling, per their description.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223824" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223824" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223824" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223824" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Palm</p></div></p>
<p>“The Palm Buds Pro&#8217;s biggest differentiator is the emphasis on studio grade audio and enhanced bass. Our engineers have also developed one of the most advanced Active Noise Cancelling and Environmental Noise Cancelling systems on the market,” says co-founder Howard Nuk in a release. “The Palm Buds Pro&#8217;s advanced 6-microphone Active Noise Cancellation system utilizes 3 individual microphones per bud, powering the most immersive sound experience, and providing the clearest calls in windy conditions on the market.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The buds are up for preorder today and will go on sale November 9, along with a $15 silicone case. “The Palm Buds Pro are the go-to for all my training sessions,&#8221; Curry says in the release. And he&#8217;s one of the best at basketball, so make of that what you will.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Misinformation and disinformation content has continued to increase across social media channels, and its effects have impacted every type of organization, from the public to private organizations. A Tel Aviv, Israel-based startup called </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cyabra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cyabra</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> has built a SaaS platform that measures authenticity and impact within the online conversation, detects false information and its authors, and further analyzes it to connect the dots.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup announced it has closed a $5.6 million Series A round as it releases several new disinformation detection analysis tools that help to increase authentic conversations, consumer influence, trends, and the success and reputation of companies. Its Series A round brings the total raised to $7.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding was led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">OurCrowd</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, along with Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Harpoon Ventures, Alabaster, Accomplice, Red Sheperd Ventures, Summus Z, TAU Ventures and Capital Y Management. Angel investors, including former global co-GM of Samsung Pay Will Graylin and former CPO of Tinder Brian Norgard, also joined in the round. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cyabra will use the proceeds to bolster its research &amp; development team, expand the company’s global footprint in the U.S. and Asia by adding marketing and sales teams as well as hiring staff, CEO of Cyabra Dan Brahmy told TechCrunch. It also plans to open an office in the U.S. on the East Coast, Brahmy said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Founded in 2018 by Brahamy, COO Yossef Daar and CTO Ido Shraga, the startup aims to become the filtering mechanism for online conversations used by various types of organizations, Brahmy told TechCrunch. The company can differentiate from competitors through its new proliferation modules, also known as Snowball Effect Analysis, which enables customers to understand narratives and discover trends to have a finger on the pulse of genuine conversation, Brahmy continued.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Snowball Effect Analysis also allows users to understand how velocity and time can affect the shape of narratives driven by impactful authors. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223194" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223194" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223194 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png" alt="Cyabra" width="2880" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Proliferation.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223194" class="wp-caption-text">Cyabra</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cyabra uses an AI lens to help its customers understand where communities are forming online to push group messaging. It also zeroes in on the authors of influence perpetrating the most proliferation. The company can gather and analyze information from tens of thousands of data sources, enabling its machine learning to reach accuracy. The company has also enhanced its autonomous client notification system, allowing users to customize preference around changes of authenticity and proliferation shifts in real-time.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cyabra serves customers across various industries, including financial services, consumer brands, advertising agencies, and public organizations with the needed tools to uncover information about in authentic narratives and authors, and even to the likes of deep fakes, to examine the influence of nefarious conversations and fake news online, Brahmy explained.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its clients and partners include the U.S. State Department, global advertising agency TBWA, and several large financial institutions. Cyabra says its revenue has increased with a 400% growth in 2020, further showing the need for these organizations to measure genuine conversations occurring online. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some other peers in the industry were acquired by tech giants, including Twitter, which </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">acquired</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> U.K.-based Fabula AI in 2019, and Facebook, which </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/thebloomsbury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bought</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> UK’s Bloomsbury AI in 2018 to help fight fake news. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We founded Cyabra to bring authenticity to the digital realm, offering solutions to help make sense of the abundance of noise in online conversations today and uncover truths within these narratives,” said Brahmy. “Disinformation is no longer solely a political issue; we’re seeing consumer brands identify a serious need to examine their online reputation and sentiment under a close lens. We’re excited to expand our footprint and leadership team to offer these companies the resources and information they need to make data-driven decisions and combat disinformation.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Nothing is more important in these times than information verification,” said CEO of OurCrowd Jon Medved. “Cyabra is helping major corporations and organizations make sure that what we all read is verified first. This is both a great social need and a great investment.” </span></p>

<p>“It’s great to see more mainstream investors interested in the space,” Dr. Michelle Longmire, CEO and co-founder of Medable, told TechCrunch. “It adds momentum to what we are going after.”</p>

<p>Indeed, part of what the company is going after is a piece of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-virtual-clinical-trials-market-research-report-2021-301383164.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global virtual clinical trials</a> market, which is forecasted to reach $11.5 billion by 2028.</p>
<p>Medable is already on a fast-growth trajectory. It has grown 300% in the past year and over 800% in the last 18 months, which Longmire said was proof that a patient-centered approach is taking hold. The company’s software is being used in 150 clinical trials taking place across 5,000 clinical sites in 60 countries and has touched tens of thousands of patient lives.</p>
<p>In addition to the patient-focused approach to clinical trials, some of Medable’s success was also driven in part by the global pandemic, Dr. Sunny Kumar, partner at GSR Ventures, said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223889" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223889" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg" alt="Medable" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223889" class="wp-caption-text">Medable&#8217;s founding team</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to 2020, there was a reluctance to change the way clinical trials were performed and an area where technology had not yet had an impact, he added. However, this is one sector of healthcare where there is strong alignment of incentives across key players of the industry: pharmaceutical companies to get patients engaged, providers to get people through their centers, payers to shift the cost of care onto pharmaceutical companies and patients to have a better experience.</p>
<p>GSR Ventures began looking at clinical trials in 2018, met Longmire in 2019 and made its first investment in Medable in 2020. At the time, the technology was small, and people were trying to work through the regulatory factors. The firm thought that decentralization was likely to be the future and where the industry would be headed, but that it would take another three to five years for mass adoption. Then COVID came along.</p>
<p>“COVID changed the game,” Kumar said. “We initially saw 10% to 12% of trials using any meaningful decentralization to now 60% to 70% having some element of decentralization. Medable has proven it is in a strong position to win outsized market share. It is a competitive market, but Medable is breaking away from the pack.”</p>
<p>It typically takes a good decade and millions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to see a new drug come to market. The goal of Medable is to decrease costs by half and increase the speed to market by two times, and Kumar says we are now seeing the impact in the decreased cost of trials, but not yet the full realization of a drug trial that started the process this way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new round gives Palo Alto-based Medable a total of $521 million in funding, which includes a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/medable-secures-78m-series-c-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$78 million Series C extension</a> in April that followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/medable-raises-91-million-for-its-clinical-trial-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$91 million round</a> last November. It also raised a $25 million venture round in May 2020.</p>
<p>Longmire says the new capital will enable the company to continue to scale its technology globally so that there is awareness, access and execution of patient-centered trials so that patients can do more in a safe manner and in ways that work better for them. It will also be invested in product development, its partner ecosystem and customer and patient success.</p>
<p>“We are looking to make game-changing progress in a fast way, and the faster we can build the infrastructure, the better,” she added. “We want to make aspects of trials more local, done in the local pharmacy or clinic. There are trials for cutting-edge oncology drugs, and we want everyone to have access to that drug no matter where they are or who they are.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly, a company looking to simplify medical billing, announced a $12m Series A round on Tuesday. Anomaly is a young company – it was only <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anomaly-1c37">founded in 2020</a>. But it has its eye set on an old, gargantuan problem: wasteful spending in the US healthcare system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly&#8217;s platform is designed to detect irregularities in medical bills. It’s A.I.-driven process comes as a result of working with “massive amounts” of claims data from insurance companies and health systems, says Jacob Shiff, co-founder, president and COO of Anomaly. That training allows the software to preemptively flag claims that might be irregular, or identify patterns in billing that end up resulting in wasteful spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our overall goal in our work with insurance companies and providers is to really use technology and deep healthcare domain expertise to remove that friction between providers and payers so that we can pay the right amount the first time,” Shiff told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223682" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round comes after a previously unannounced $5 million seed round which closed earlier this year, bringing the company’s total funding up to $17 million. The Series A round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RRE Ventures and included participation from Link Ventures. Existing investors also include Madrona Venture Group, Declaration Partners and Redesign Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly will use the funds to grow the team (the company currently has 12 employees), and scale up their business by partnering with more insurance companies and healthcare systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional solutions have focused on an outsourced and reactive approach to dealing with improper payments,” said Kyle Tatz, the head of new ventures at Redesign Health. “We felt that Anomaly’s approach from day one to partner with payers and providers to pay the right amount the first time stood out from the industry standard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are inefficiencies in clinical care that cost extra dollars, the bulk of wasteful spending, at least according to one 2019 </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, doesn&#8217;t happen at bedside. Analysis of over 54 publications suggested over $300 billion each year is wasted on inefficiencies related to medical billing. That study was conducted by a team of economists, but William Shrank, the chief medical officer of Humana, an insurance company, is the paper’s lead author.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest category of waste was “administrative complexity” – in other words, the burden of needlessly complex paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatz calls that $300 billion “an indication of how much white space there is in the market for better solutions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine that, with your credit card, every month you got your statement and 10 percent of your charges were just incorrect,” says Shiff. “That’s the status quo in healthcare.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the question of how to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fix </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the paperwork problem happened to be a blind spot in healthcare research. The paper was unable to find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies revealing solid ways to save money by reducing administrative complexity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the paper was published, some argued that turning to a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/upshot/health-care-waste-study.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-payer healthcare system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the most expedient way to tackle this category. Others argue other countries with private healthcare systems still manage to spend less on administrative costs than the US does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, take one </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2018 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on healthcare spending in the US and 11 other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. The US spent about 8 percent of its GDP on “administration and governance.&#8221; The other nations spent an average of three percent on that category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly calls its approach to this financially leaky blindspot in healthcare spending “precision payments.” When a provider files a claim with an insurer, Anomaly can peruse the claim and ensure there are no errors. If there are, the provider would receive a real-time response pointing out the error (that’s the idea behind one of the company’s products: Anomaly Prevent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s other product, Anomaly recover, identifies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">past </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">overpayments that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiff would not name which insurance companies or healthcare systems Anomaly is already working with, but the company does have ties to major players in the industry. The chairman of the company’s board is Jeff Alter, the former CEO of United Healthcare’s commercial branch and current executive vice president of IngenioRx and Anthem Health Solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiff did note that Anomaly is working with two “regional payers in the Northeast” and a “healthcare system in Florida.” He also wouldn’t disclose any metrics as to how Anomaly has managed to save these systems money or simplify claims. Instead, he described the results abstractly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re really excited by the results that we&#8217;re seeing. The results are really very meaningful, in terms of the dollars and cents, themselves,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that medical billing is overly complicated and rife with errors isn’t exactly breaking news. Tatz argues that now is the time to tackle the problem because of an “increased recognition among healthcare stakeholders” that AI can reduce waste, and, because healthcare costs are &#8220;reaching a breaking point.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found payers and providers are increasingly seeking solutions like Anomaly that reduce administrative waste and friction, which is the low-hanging cost to cut in the healthcare ecosystem,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Latin America Fund led the financing with a $50 million contribution, bringing Pipefy’s total raised to $138.7 million since its 2015 inception. Steadfast Capital Management, Insight Partners and Redpoint eventures also put money in the round. The San Francisco-based company declined to reveal at what valuation the money was raised, saying only it is “close to unicorn status.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy was originally headquartered in Brazil, and since much of the startup’s R&amp;D is still located in the country, and it has a significant presence there, the company was still considered for the SoftBank Latin America Fund, officials say. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Pipefy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $45 million from Insight Partners, Openview and Trinity Ventures. Insight led that round. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Pipefy aims to redefine workflow management. It has more than 4,000 corporate customers globally, including GE Healthcare, Lacoste, Magalu, electric truck maker Rivian and Nubank, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the startup would not disclose hard revenue figures, CEO and founder Alessio Alionço did say that Pipefy doubled its annual recurring revenue over the past year. It has also doubled its headcount to 500 today, compared to 250 employees in January.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223872" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223872" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223872 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223872" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipefy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it talks about workflow management, the startup says it has the ability to automate “virtually any repeatable process” such as employee onboarding, purchasing/procurement, recruiting, IT service requests and expense reimbursement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Alionço: “Our tool enables citizen developers. These are the professionals who do the work but who do not have IT training. With Pipefy, these citizen developers can independently create shareable, standardized forms to collect data and customize the workflows that they understand as practitioners &#8212; without having to rely on IT to build their applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy uses if/then conditionals to automate process phases and, in essence, unify a variety of collaboration channels &#8212; such as Slack and spreadsheets &#8212; into one portal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims it can also support more complex operations in which IT teams use its tool to integrate legacy systems, like ERPs or CRMs, to orchestrate operations across multiple systems of record.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Pipefy’s goal is to give companies &#8212; from emerging startups to large multinational companies &#8212; a way to “nimbly” automate and customize their integrated workflows. Describing Pipefy as a horizontal platform, Alionço said that it is “vertical and industry agnostic.” The company touts that a variety of teams within an organization can benefit from its offering, including finance, human resources, customer service, procurement and marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy stands out from competitors, Alionço said, because its low-code implementation can “easily scale” from a single team to an entire enterprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic served to increase demand for its offering, according to Alionço, in that it put “severe pressure on IT organizations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As restrictions caused by the virus begin to lift, more and more companies are offering hybrid, remote and in-person, work models,” he said. “This means employees are more dispersed than ever before. Pipefy saw, and continues to see, demand for tools that like ours provide automated processes and visibility over remote employees and projects.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223874" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223874" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223874 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipefy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, more IT leaders and CIOs are becoming customers and implementing Pipefy’s software, noted president and COO Ananth Avva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our low-code approach is meeting the needs of distributed workforces around the world,” Alionço said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to “significantly accelerate” its global expansion. It also plans to continue to hire globally and further develop its product and go-to-market strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it originated in Brazil, it already has strong brand visibility in the country. Pipefy has plans to expand “rapidly” in other LatAm Countries. In 2021, it worked on gaining a strong foothold in the U.S. market. Next year, it plans to focus on growing its customer base in the U.S., and on acquiring new customers in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in Asia Pacific countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pipefy is a SaaS platform that can be rapidly configured and activated anywhere in the world, and our team is multilingual, so the company does not face many of the typical costs that come with global expansion,” Alionço told TechCrunch.</span></p>
