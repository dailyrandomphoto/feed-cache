		Luca Rossettini is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was Branson versus Bezos, rocket against rocket, in the race to send the first billionaire into space.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">announced</a> on June 7 that Jeff Bezos, its founder, would fly on the firm’s first crewed mission scheduled for July 20. That same day, <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/">Parabolic Arc</a> reported that Virgin Galactic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/">planning</a> to send Richard Branson on a suborbital flight on July 11. And both aimed to beat the third space-going billionaire, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>More than half a century after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, space exploration is clearly on the upswing again. However, today’s missions reflect far more than the ambitions of billionaires, even if Musk, Bezos and Branson have generated the most headlines for their personal space plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, we’re seeing the emergence of a true space economy. This new sector is in its exponential growth phase, and what unifies current commercial projects is the influx of investments in new technologies and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today’s explorers have plans for expansion that range from the outer limits of our imagination — travel to other planets or colonizing Mars — to the launches of thousands of telecommunication, global navigation and Earth observation satellites, with massive investments being made.</p>
<p>The size of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/2018_ast_compendium.pdf">global space economy</a> &#8212; which combines satellite services and ground equipment, government space budgets and global navigation satellites equipment &#8212; is estimated to be about $345 billion. Startup space ventures <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Start_Up_Space_2020.pdf">brought in $5.7 billion</a> in 2019, easily besting 2018’s $3.5 billion record. By 2040, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space">more than $1 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re at the start of a gold rush in outer space — and our track record for the sustainable development of any environment during gold rushes hasn’t been particularly noteworthy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The threat of catastrophic space collisions is growing</h2>
<p>We are at a critical tipping point for ensuring the safe and sustainable development of new business opportunities in space. Many of these activities use the same regions of the Earth’s orbit, which is not an infinite space. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html">NASA</a>, more than 100 million pieces of orbital debris of about 1 mm or larger are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors. Much more debris &#8212; too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions &#8212; exists in the near-Earth space environment.</p>
<p>In an environment where both debris and spacecraft are traveling at velocities in excess of 15,700 mph in low-Earth orbit, even a 5 mm nut can shred a solar panel like it was made of paper. In fact, NASA reports that millimeter-sized orbital debris represents the highest mission-ending risk to most robotic spacecraft operating in low-Earth orbit. As space becomes more and more congested, unsafe or irresponsible actions by any one actor could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Advances in reusable rockets, which lowered the cost to launch 1 kilogram of payload mass to orbit, and the miniaturization of satellites have all helped to create this threat of a traffic jam in Earth’s orbit. Nearly <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/visualizing-easrth-satellites-sapce-spacex/">3,000 active satellites</a> are currently in orbit above our planet, and this number will likely skyrocket in the coming years. A 230% increase in satellite launches per year is expected by 2025, with 24,000 satellite launches now in planning, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/space-infrastructure-is-the-next-investment-frontier-and-spacs-are-a-launch-pad-11618294752#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20experts%20predict%20a,applied%20to%20fly%2040%2C000%20satellites.">according to MarketWatch</a>. And that figure doesn’t even include launches by SpaceX, OneWeb or Kuiper. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613591/spacexs-starlink-satellites-are-clearly-visible-in-the-skyand-astronomers-arent-happy/">SpaceX’s</a> Starlink alone has applied to fly 40,000 satellites.</p>
<p>The cost to launch 22 tons to low-Earth orbit has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/06/space-tech-transforming-satellite-launches-with-blockchain/">declined</a> from $200 million to about $60 million thanks to reusable rockets. Satellite applications that once required one massive high-performance satellite with a cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars can now be tackled with constellations of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/small-satellites-growth-space/#:~:text=It%20says%20it%20can%20build,able%20to%20endure%20for%20years.">cheaper</a> ($1 million), smaller, lower-performance satellites working together to provide a global service.</p>
<p>While the performance of a single smaller satellite is still inferior to that of a much larger one, the use of data from multiple satellites can often produce comparable results. Moreover, the architecture of a constellation is highly scalable, so as soon as newer generations of satellites are launched, the performance of the infrastructure as a whole increases exponentially.</p>
<h2>Sustainable development requires new technologies and better governance</h2>
<p>Sustainable economic expansion will require innovative solutions to support traditional and new customers throughout the life cycle of a space mission, from a careful analysis of a mission&#8217;s requirements to end-of-life decommissioning.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions will require completely new space-based infrastructures that can streamline launch, operation and decommissioning. D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier, for example, is a space transportation vehicle designed to host a batch of satellites, transport them to orbit and release them individually into distinct orbital slots. This deployment service complements the one offered by launch providers, which targets only the most strategic orbits, enabling satellite operators to cover the last mile in a significantly shorter time and use all the resources of their spacecraft to extend the duration of the mission itself.</p>
<p>This is the first step toward the creation of permanent space logistic infrastructures that can move spacecraft from one orbit to another, extend the life of older vehicles, perform repairs and collect satellite wrecks and other debris.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding sustainable growth in the space economy are too important and consequential to be left to a single company or country.</p>
<p>To strengthen international cooperation and establish a set of ground rules, we need a new model of space governance based on consensus among countries, with common standards. While the technology for debris-capturing spacecraft is already attainable, for example, there are still legal challenges to allow an operator based in a country to approach, capture and remove a space object launched by another country. Formulating global regulation to address this kind of operation is an essential step that can open new markets and business opportunities.</p>
<p>Forty-eight organizations and other government and industry stakeholders, including D-Orbit, formed the <a href="https://spacesafety.org/">Space Safety Coalition</a> (SSC) in 2019 to actively promote best practices for the long-term sustainability of space operations. The SSC has developed guidelines for avoiding launch and on-orbit collisions, minimizing human casualties from spacecraft or debris reentry and minimizing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) events, among other best practices for the overall long-term sustainability of space operations.</p>
<p>This industry-led sustainability effort needs to be adopted by all space stakeholders. How we develop and regulate the space economy will have long-lasting repercussions, and the window for avoiding mistakes is rapidly closing.</p>
<p>It is essential that we lose no time in developing the infrastructure, best practices and governance that will broaden humankind’s ability to operate in space and create still-unimagined opportunities for us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s external policy review board will meet with Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who went public with her concerns about the company last week. Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/1232363373906301-oversight-board-to-meet-with-frances-haugen/">announced Monday</a> that it would meet with Haugen &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221; after the whistleblower accepted the board&#8217;s invitation to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Board members appreciate the chance to discuss Ms. Haugen’s experiences and gather information that can help push for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook through our case decisions and recommendations,&#8221; the Oversight Board wrote in a blog post.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have accepted the invitation to brief the Facebook Oversight Board about what I learned while working there. Facebook has lied to the board repeatedly, and I am looking forward to sharing the truth with them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Frances Haugen (@FrancesHaugen) <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen/status/1447617378402160642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In its announcement of the meeting with Haugen, the Oversight Board mentioned its ongoing interest in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">secret Facebook program known as &#8220;cross check&#8221;</a> that allowed some high profile users to circumvent the platform&#8217;s rules. The board said it was specifically examining whether the company had been &#8220;fully forthcoming&#8221; when answering questions on the cross check system and plans to share its findings in a report later in October.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of the program in an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=series_facebookfiles"> investigative series on Facebook published last month</a>. Those reports drew on documents provided by Haugen, who at the time served as an unrevealed source for the paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today released its second minor update to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios-15/">iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/">iPadOS 15</a>, which includes an &#8220;important security update&#8221; for a zero-day bug under active exploitation.</p>
<p>iOS 15.0.2 and iPadOS 15.0.2, which are available to download on supported devices now, include a fix for a memory corruption vulnerability that allowed an application to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of device access, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846">Apple says on its security support page</a>.</p>
<p>While details on the bug remain thin, Apple warns that it &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; — so it&#8217;s probably a good idea to update your devices right away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The updates also address a number of other glitches in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, including an issue that caused the iPhone Leather Wallet and with MagSafe and not to connect to Find My, a bug that could cause AirTags not to appear in the ‌Find My‌ Items tab, and another that caused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/carplay/">CarPlay</a> to fail to open audio apps or to disconnect during playback. There&#8217;s also a fix for a glitch that saw photos saved to your library from Messages deleted after removing the associated thread or message.</p>
<p>Apple is currently testing the first major update to iOS 15.1, which will be the first major update to iOS 15. This update will re-enable SharePlay in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">FaceTime</a>, add new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max camera features, and bring support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet. It&#8217;ll probably include a handful of bug fixes, too.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When building a startup, you’re making what feels like a million decisions on timing — when to launch to time the market, when to hire that key role, when to raise another round. But one of your most important timing decisions might be one you aren’t even considering yet: When to approach the enterprise. If you aren’t debating that now, chances are you’re overlooking a big opportunity.</p>
<p>I saw this time and again while working with dozens of startup CEOs while at Greylock Partners. Approaching the enterprise can feel daunting for early-stage teams. Many founders would push back when I suggested it, and I get why: It’s uncomfortable and maybe even counterintuitive. A commonly heard refrain was: &#8220;We&#8217;re not ready. We&#8217;re too early. We want to optimize our product more first.&#8221; They were afraid that if they talked to large enterprise companies too soon, they’d blow it.</p>
<p>In my experience, the opposite is true. At a startup, you’re constantly trying to maximize learning in the tightest loops possible. The earlier you start, the more valuable the knowledge and iterations you accrue. Your go-to-market is no different.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company <em>and</em> woo the enterprise at the same time.</p>
<h2>A short history lesson</h2>
<p>Take Slack, for example. A darling of startups across the Valley and beyond, Slack grew into a can’t-live-without technology for many teams. It&#8217;s a success by nearly anyone’s standards, and yet, it is a company that didn’t survive as an independent public company. Why? Because it couldn’t quite break into the enterprise on its own timetable.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company and woo the enterprise at the same time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Slack enjoyed hypergrowth among startups, but it got beat out by Microsoft Teams on the big deals. Microsoft used its enterprise credibility, deep distribution channels and raw muscle to block Slack from signing big companies that had to work within established protocols and existing infrastructure. Teams might not have had the same stellar user experience, but it met enterprises where they were and played by the buying rules they understood.</p>
<p>The result? Slack got acquired by Salesforce for $27.2 billion 12 years after it was founded.</p>
<p>To be clear, Slack’s acquisition — the largest in Salesforce’s history — is not a bad outcome. Lots of startups dream of such an exit, but it&#8217;s probably not the one the company was seeking given its darling status and enormous popularity. It was a catch-up move, a way to use Salesforce’s weight to get a shot at competing with Teams.</p>
<p>The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?</p>
<p>A bottoms-up approach to growth, like Slack famously championed, is fantastic, until it’s not enough. Having helped dozens of portfolio companies approach the enterprise at Greylock Partners and now as a startup CEO myself, here’s some advice on how to avoid common missteps:</p>
<h2>Start sooner than you think you should</h2>
<p>Some of the most commercially successful companies in the world today engaged with enterprise customers before they even had a product. The purpose is to gather intelligence about what a customer would want, what they’d value or how they’d evaluate their product. Startups can gain important information that may help shape their trajectory and get the product enterprise-ready much faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime">partnering with audio entertainment production studio Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts. The two companies have entered into a creative programming and strategic agreement, under which Audio Up is expected to create new podcasts for SiriusXM and its platforms, including the SXM app, Pandora and Sticher.</p>
<p>Audio Up, which was established in 2020, is a podcast content production studio that has created a slate of original scripted audio entertainment featuring marquee names across music, Hollywood and publishing, including Machine Gun Kelly, Garrett Hedlund and Stephen King.</p>
<p>The agreement gives SiriusXM an exclusive first-look option for new Audio Up original podcast concepts and exclusive rights to manage and sell advertising inventory in connection with any podcast produced for SiriusXM. Audio Up is expected to be an additional creative driver for SiriusXM in connecting artists, labels, brands, and creators of all types in developing new audio entertainment programming across SiriusXM channels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216150" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Audio Up also announced today that it has completed a $12 million Series B funding round led by SiriusXM. Further, Andrew Moss, SiriusXM&#8217;s senior vice president of business affairs and programming operations, is joining the board of directors of Audio Up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Audio Up is known for creating podcasts that combine music, entertainment, and rich storytelling to create bold new listening experiences, and we&#8217;re thrilled to welcome them to our extended SiriusXM family,” said Scott Greenstein, the president and chief creative officer of SiriusXM, in a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime"> press release.</a></p>
<p>A variety of original podcasts from Audio Up’s back catalog will also be represented across the SXM app, Pandora and Sticher, including Halloween in Hell, The Ballad of Uncle Drank, Bedtime Stories of the Ingleside Inn, Sonic Leap and Make It Up as We Go.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the vast reach and wide diversity of listeners that SiriusXM, Pandora and Stitcher together represent, we not only have a massive new multi-platform outlet for our original programming, but in SiriusXM we have a creative ally who shares our ambitions to keep pushing podcasting forward,” said Audio Up CEO and founder, Jared Gutstadt, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement with Audio Up follows SiriusXM’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> last year. The deal meant that thousands of podcasts moved to the SiriusXM roster, after which the company said it now had the “the largest addressable audience” in the United States for digital audio, including music, sports, talk and podcasts, covering 150 million listeners. It has also tried to differentiate Pandora from competitors by offering multiple pricing tiers and unique show formats,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/pandora-expands-its-music-and-podcasts-product-pandora-stories-with-help-from-siriusxms-guests/"> like Pandora Stories</a>, aided by SiriusXM&#8217;s guests.</p>
<p>SiriusXM’s new partnership with Audio Up will further its investments in podcasting and help it continue to compete with others in the audio space, as numerous companies are also looking to expand their podcast offerings. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/spotifys-catalog-tops-a-million-podcasts-consumption-increased-by-triple-digits-over-last-year/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/shonda-rhimes-iheartmedia/">iHeartMedia</a> have made notable acquisitions to acquire original podcasting content, as well as tools for podcasters to help run their businesses. Additionally, Apple is also investing in podcasts and recently made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions live</a> across more than 170 countries and regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney&#8217;s newest digital service, Disney Genie, is <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/10/disney-genie-launching-at-walt-disney-world-resort/">launching on October 19</a> at Walt Disney World Resort. The service, first <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">unveiled</a> in August, is an update to the company&#8217;s earlier line reservation tools for Disney&#8217;s parks, allowing guests to plan and update their itineraries, book time slots for the most popular attractions, and optionally purchase paid access to the fast lanes&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/genie/lightning-lane/">Lightning Lane</a>&#8221; entrances, either a la carte on top attractions or through the &#8220;Genie+&#8221; add-on.</p>
<p>The service will replace Disney&#8217;s older FASTPASS, FastPass+ and Disney MaxPass services, as Disney Genie will roll out across Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, the company said.</p>
<p>At the core of the Disney Genie experience is a smart trip-planning capability that maps out a personalized itinerary based on what rides, attractions, or food and entertainment experiences guests want to make sure to do while at the parks. That means Genie users can customize their day based on not only the top attractions, but also their general interests &#8212; like whether they need to incorporate Princess meet-and-greets into their day, or if they&#8217;d rather seek out the best cocktails at the park&#8217;s bars, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney (choosing your interests in the app) </p></div></p>
<p>Before Genie, guests make up to three reservations in advance of a park visit through the FastPass+ scheduling system, and could then continue to make reservations through the My Disney Experience app after those first three reservations had been used. But this free system made it difficult to get reservations on top rides, as it favored Disney resort-goers who could book 60 days in advance, while others got a 30-day window. It also didn&#8217;t make all top rides (aka Tier 1 attractions) available for the initial booking.</p>
<p>Disney Genie aims to address some of these issues, but for a fee. That&#8217;s led to quite a bit of <a href="https://blogmickey.com/2021/08/disney-fans-overwhelmingly-dislike-disney-genie-announcement/">backlash</a> from Disney fans who feel they already pay enough for their Disney trips and don&#8217;t want to add on more charges. In fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fP50klEPE">the video announcement</a> has a ratio of 12,000 dislikes to just 948 likes, as of the time of writing. However, paid fast lane access to a park&#8217;s main attractions is a common staple at Disney&#8217;s theme park competitors &#8212; and one that can help those who have tighter schedules ensure they get everything done.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9fP50klEPE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Genie&#8217;s WDW launch on October 19, guests will be able to choose from the two paid options &#8212; either individual access to up to 2 Lightning Lanes or Genie+&#8217;s broader selection.</p>
<p>Disney says the following rides are available for the a la carte option: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Space Mountain at Magic Kingdom, Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure and Frozen Ever After at Epcot, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey &amp; Minnie&#8217;s Runaway Railway at Disney Hollywood Studios, and Avatar Flight of Passage and Expedition Everest at Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom.</p>
<p>While picking two options could help speed up your wait times, it may not include your must-have ride selections.</p>
<p>Disney Genie+, meanwhile, opens up Lightning Lanes at a total of 40+ attractions across the four parks instead, including many more of the Tier 1 rides. It will be priced at $15 per ticket per day at Walt Disney World Resort and $20 per ticket per day at Disneyland Resort, when available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216161" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216161" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216161" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216161" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney</p></div></p>
<p>The a la carte pricing will vary by date, attraction, and park, Disney says. While Disney hasn&#8217;t announced specific ranges for each ride, it has offered some examples. It says the Lightning Lane entrance to Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure will be $9 per person on October 19 and $11 per person on October 23. But on those same dates, the Lightning Lane entrance to Expedition Everest – Legend of the Forbidden Mountain will be just  $7 per person, while Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance will be $15 per person.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s news of the Oct. 19 launch at Walt Disney World Resort, the company is also detailing how the feature is integrated into its My Disney Experience app. This is the app offering access to your tickets, park maps, showtimes, online food ordering, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_4.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney</p></div></p>
<p>Today, many park-goers turn to third-party apps like those from TouringPlans.com or other indie developers, as well as Disney fan blogs to get tips about how to plan their route through a given park to ensure they see all the main attractions and events. But Genie promises to help prioritize your trip for you directly in its own My Disney Experience app, using the company&#8217;s understanding of things like wait times and other park changes &#8212; like rides that temporarily closed or other delays. This in-house option could potentially impact the revenue streams from the third-party businesses that have sprung up to address park planning needs.</p>
<p>Plus, unlike static plans, Genie&#8217;s experience will adapt to users&#8217; days and their own unexpected plan changes &#8212; like needing to head back to the hotel to let little kids nap, taking an unplanned snack break, or deciding you want to ride something twice. As you adjust your plans, Genie also updates your itinerary. And this aspect of the service is offered for free, even if you&#8217;re not paying for fast lane entry.</p>
<p>Disney has not yet announced when Disney Genie will launch at Disneyland Resort, but <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">said</a> earlier that it would arrive this fall.</p>

The city of Los Angeles — eager to introduce zero-emission transportation — wants to ensure the launch of air taxis doesn&#8217;t repeat past mistakes.</div>

<p id="speakable-summary">To help prepare Los Angeles for the new tech, a nonprofit organization spun out of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti&#8217;s office is working with air taxi developers and local residents to develop a policy toolkit in advance of commercial operations later this decade.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to be hammered out before then. Foremost, the aircraft must be certified with the Federal Aviation Administration &#8212; a mammoth task in and of itself. But even beyond aircraft certification, companies will also need to plan for infrastructure, namely vertiports, or where the air taxis will take off and land. And these come with real issues like noise pollution and zoning laws that have the potential to affect not only city residents but other transportation networks, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.urbanmovementlabs.com/">Urban Movement Labs</a> was spun out of the mayor’s Office of Economic Development in 2020 to become a standalone 501c(3) nonprofit aimed at shaping the future of mobility in the city. This year, the organization commenced an urban air mobility (UAM) partnership with the mayor’s office and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to drill down into how the city can integrate UAM into existing infrastructure and transportation networks in a way that maximizes equity and accessibility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2209157" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The partnership is being funded, in part, by Archer Aviation and Hyundai’s Urban Air Mobility division.</p>
<p>“We have a commitment from Hyundai and Archer to actually focus on assisting us in developing this policy toolkit,” Sam Morrissey, UML’s executive director, explained to TechCrunch in a recent interview. “That&#8217;s everything from the policies around where these vehicles will fly, the air routes, where these vehicles may land outside of commercial airports … and other related policies around planning for [vertiports].”</p>
<p>Joby Aviation has coordinated with UML since the organization was formed, and German UAM developer Volocopter joined as UML’s newest partner earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Our role is to really facilitate the new deployment of technology in Los Angeles,” Morrissey said. He added that the city wants to avoid the ex post facto scramble to regulate transportation technologies, like what happened after the launch of Uber, Lyft and scooter rental services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Particularly in 2016, when Uber Elevate started talking about flying taxis in cities, the city of Los Angeles said, ‘We need to have a separate entity that can help focus this.’”</p>
<h2>The infrastructure challenge</h2>
<p>UML fashions itself as a three-way bridge between the city, private industry and, most importantly, Los Angelenos. The three perspectives may not always align. The launch of electric air taxis, in particular, presents unique challenges that need to be solved, everything from fire risk and zoning issues to noise pollution and issues that cause disagreement among stakeholders.</p>
<p>Consider vertiports. While certifying the aircraft is solely in the jurisdiction of the FAA, &#8220;if you want to build new infrastructure on the ground, this is obviously a municipal and a city question,&#8221; <span class="il">Greg</span> Bowles, Joby&#8217;s head of government affairs, explained to TechCrunch. &#8220;The way you want to use that, the access to that, the permitting, those are all municipal [issues].&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey said companies are primarily approaching route planning from a market standpoint — for example, looking at where people currently use Uber Black, the ride-sharing company&#8217;s premium service — while Urban Movement Labs wants to overlay that onto a regional-planning approach that accounts for how UAM would support existing transportation networks in the long term.</p>
<p>Siting and zoning laws are another issue. Beyond the easy-to-imagine NIMBYism that may crop up once potential vertiport sites are located, operational tempo, or flights per hour, could affect how many air taxi operators can use a given site.</p>
<p>While both Archer and Joby have announced private partnerships with REEF Technology to convert assets like parking garages into vertiport sites (and UML recognizes that these locations make a great deal of sense for a number of reasons), the city’s own regulations must still be accounted for before air taxis can start ferrying customers.</p>
<p>“Converting the roof of a parking structure sounds good, but you ultimately still need [the building and safety departments] to come in and say that this deck can support these aircraft, that the fire suppression needs are adequate enough,” Morrissey said.</p>
<p>A major question mark is whether and how many vertiports will be exclusive-use versus shared among the companies. One can imagine air taxi takeoff and landing sites like airport gates (homogenous and shared among all airlines) or more like gas stations (branded, competitive and offering different amenities). This, too, could be another potential point of contention between the city, its residents and the air taxi companies.</p>
<p>At least in the beginning, however, many companies may decide that working together &#8212; to set standards relating to noise and charging, for example &#8212; is the faster route to overall commercialization and adoption than working separately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really look at this as a competitive space,&#8221; Bowles said of Joby&#8217;s work on vertiport standards. &#8220;This is something we have to build, so we&#8217;re working with a lot of the other OEMs and future operators.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160169" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160169" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160169" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.jobyaviation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joby Aviation <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The final question, of course, is the perennial one: Who’s going to pay for it?</p>
<p>“When we think about vertiports in the future, it&#8217;s going to be really a combination of who provides the capital to build and operate that vertiport, and a conversation with the city as far as who can access those vertiports and what the pros and cons might be to a community, of having open-access vertiports versus not open access,” Archer’s head of business development, Andrew Cummins, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Echoing Cummins, UML&#8217;s urban air mobility fellow, Clint Harper, said that while the city of Los Angeles has been clear about its preference for an “OEM-ambiguous” infrastructure, much of the final network will depend on whether vertiports are completely private enterprises or built through public-private partnerships. “They&#8217;re different funding models to bring infrastructure into reality,” he said. “Depending on what that funding model looks like, I think will tell us whether it&#8217;s going to be a multioperator type of facility or a single operator facility.”</p>
<p>Volocopter&#8217;s chief commercial officer, Christian <span class="il">Bauer, told TechCrunch</span> it was the company&#8217;s viewpoint that “we need an open system” for all OEMs. “We do not want to invest into real estate,” he added.</p>
<h2>Working with the city and beyond</h2>
<p>Many of these questions are big and will likely take years to reconcile. In part, that’s because cities are still awaiting guidance from federal regulators. Harper told TechCrunch that UML is staying flexible as recommendations from the FAA, National Fire Protection Association and the International Code Council’s building code continue to evolve.</p>
<p>For their part, air taxi OEMs are also working at the federal level to provide input into developing policies. Archer, Joby and Volocopter are all also working with federal regulators and city municipalities.</p>
<p>Looking to the rest of the year and into next, UML said it’s reaching out to transportation advocacy groups, like pedestrian safety or cyclist organizations, as well as social issue groups that focus on things like homelessness, to understand how to plan for urban air mobility. Equity is particularly important in transportation planning in order to avoid repeating past mistakes: The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, found that California&#8217;s people of color and low-income residents are <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/inequitable-exposure-air-pollution-vehicles-california-2019#ucs-report-downloads">disproportionately exposed</a> to tailpipe emissions.</p>
<p>Much of the work on the city side is simply ensuring that relevant city departments are up to date on the latest developments with vertiports. Some of that comes down to ensuring the building and safety and fire departments, among others, can assign full-time staff to prepare for vertiports and new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Morrissey said UML is trying to be methodical.</p>
<p>“I think the reality is that these vehicles are coming, and we really want to do everything we can to plan for it but stay out of the hype cycle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Varda Space Industries, a startup that wants to build in-space manufacturing facilities, will be sending its first spacecraft to orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2023.</p>
<p>The actual spacecraft &#8212; the startup’s first to go to orbit &#8212; will be made by SpaceX’s rival launch company, Rocket Lab, which will also make two subsequent space vehicles for Varda. The three vehicles will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: a microgravity manufacturing module and a reentry capsule.</p>
<p>The aim is for each spacecraft to spend approximately three months in orbit, with the reentry module bringing back around 40-60 kilograms of manufactured materials.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/embed/#?secret=gsx1Tib6X3" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Varda’s goal is to unlock the benefits of microgravity &#8212; which can only be found for sustained periods in space &#8212; for manufacturing novel materials, like bio-printed organs or specialized semiconductors. The startup’s bet is that the potential market for such materials is high enough to make the effort worth it.</p>
<p>The Torrance, California-based startup has been moving fast since its founding by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov a little less than a year ago. Varda announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-industries-closes-42m-series-a-for-off-planet-manufacturing/">$42 million Series A</a> in July, and plans on following an aggressive launch schedule, with two launches in 2023 and a third in 2024.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will be one of many objects aboard the Falcon 9 rideshare mission, a new and lucrative program that spreads the cost of going to space between customers by allowing them to essentially carpool to space. SpaceX promises to slash the cost of launch to as low as $1 million for an individual customer looking to send up to 200 kilograms of payload to sun synchronous orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of its launch on October 19, it seems as if retailers and Google are playing a game of chicken about who can leak the most information about its two upcoming flagship phones; the Google Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 6 Pro. Google&#8217;s Pixel line of smartphones has traditionally been the flagship of the Android armada for those of us who like our Android operating system as un-adorned as possible. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/google-keeps-it-simple-with-the-pixel-5/">a somewhat underwhelming Pixel 5</a>, which meant that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-now-has-three-mid-range-pixel-phones/">the company had a number of mid-range phones</a> and no real flagship to speak off, Google seems to have learned its lesson. With the un-Apple-y approach of <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US">leaking its own device</a> a few weeks before launch, all googly eyes are on the duo of upcoming phones.</p>
<p>As the launch date crawls closer, the pace of information being pushed on the public hasn&#8217;t exactly slowed. Over the weekend, U.K. phone store <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/">Carphone Warehouse</a> published its sales pages for the two phones. Of course, the retailer yanked the pages as soon as they could, but not before <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889">an eagle-eyed leak-hunter snagged some screen shots</a>. In addition, Google has started advertising the yet-to-be-shipped pocket computers in a variety of media, too, presumably in the hope that some doubters will hesitate for long enough before pressing the buy-it-now button on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-iphone-13-mini-pro-max-keynote-live-stream-livestream/">Apple&#8217;s recently launched iPhone 13</a> series. In the advertising and marketing activities, which star<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">ted all the way back in August</a>, Google is <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">highlighting some of the advantages it has over its Cupertino-conceived cousin, and staking out the competitive landscape. </span></p>
<p>As you might expect, given that this is where a lot of the smartphone war has shifted its bellicose behavior, the leaked pages heavily focus on the quality of the cameras. The Google Pixel 6 continues the Android trend of adding computer vision and AI smarts to the photo-taking process but also introduces some top-shelf hardware to the mix. The Pixel 6 reportedly gets a 50mpx wide-angle camera and a 12mpx ultra-wide. The Pixel 6 Pro gets a trio of cameras &#8212; two with the same spec as its little brother, and an additional 48mpx telephoto lens.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216079" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216079" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?w=680" alt="Google Tensor image" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png 2551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Screenshot from <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a>&#8216;s official Pixel 6 holding page. (Image has been cropped)</p></div></p>
<p>The other big highlight is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-is-building-its-own-chip-for-the-pixel-6/">the already-much-discussed Tensor chip</a> that is making its debut in the new phones</p>
<p>The marketing pages also shed additional light on the claims Google is making about its battery technology. Adaptive battery performance means that the phones&#8217; batteries can charge from flat to 50% charge in just half an hour, and the operating system has a bunch of smarts built-in to further stretch your battery life for those days when you venture too far away from a power socket. The company also highlights high-speed wireless charging for when you&#8217;re hanging on without a thread.</p>
<p>With its main competitors making a bigger deal of security, Google joins the fray on that battlefront as well, claiming &#8220;more layers of hardware security than any other phone,&#8221; reminding users that they are introducing the Titan M2 security chip and a promise of &#8220;five years of updates&#8221; which will ensure it &#8220;gets more secure over time.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t immediately clear whether this refers to firmware updates or updates of the OS, but it&#8217;s encouraging to see Android stand behind its phones even as they age into oblivion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We expect to learn more about the phones as the launch date crawls closer. We expect preorders to start next week, on October 19.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch events always offer a compelling mix of main stage presentations and smaller, breakout sessions that allow more time for lots of questions and deeper discussions. Expect nothing less at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27.</p>
<p>We want to highlight the sponsored sessions we have on tap for you. Remember, TechCrunch sponsors don’t just cut a check and call it a day. They show up ready to inform, enlighten and take questions in their area of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>A quick reminder from the home office:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> right here. Prices go up at the virtual door.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before we tell you about the specific sessions, consider this feedback we received from Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax.</p>
<p>“There was always something interesting going on in one of the breakout sessions, and I was impressed by the quality of the people participating. Partners in well-known VC firms spoke, they were accessible, and they shared smart, insightful nuggets. You will not find this level of people accessible and in one place anywhere else.”</p>
<p>And now, a word from our sponsors. You’ll find the exact times (and more presentations) listed in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities:</strong> As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO Co-founder and CEO, Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities. Presented by KUDO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack Founder and CEO, Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like. Presented by RudderStack.</p>
<p><strong>How do High-growth Companies use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?</strong> Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl prohibits growth?</strong> SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100 percent. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS Management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. Presented by LeanIX.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale:</strong> As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries. Presented by AKASA.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving a satellite’s thruster power and maneuverability can play a vital role in space sustainability. How? Developing and testing new technologies — like electronic propulsion systems (EPS) — can ultimately help better smallsats achieve their correct orbit, avoid collisions with space junk and then de-orbit safely when they become non-operational.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPS and other new technologies can be used in smaller spacecraft without decreasing their capability to perform tasks like maintaining camera imaging, communications and other mission-critical projects.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s on the thruster horizon? You’ll have ample opportunity to learn about the latest up-and-coming advancements happening in in-space propulsion technologies at the virtual edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space this December 14-15</a>. Case in point:</span><a href="https://accion-systems.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — developer of ion propulsion systems for satellites — will be in the virtual house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to redefine the performance, efficiency and scalability of spacecraft propulsion systems to expand what’s possible in space. Or, as Natalya Bailey, the company’s co-founder &amp; CTO said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make space more affordable and accessible by changing what spacecraft can do in and beyond Earth’s orbit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propulsion systems don’t just power space flight; they power possibility and opportunity. Take advantage of your opportunity to learn more about this topic alongside, lunar sampling, orbit servicing and the commercialization of space from barrier-breaking companies at TC Sessions: Space 2021.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/">SkyCell</a>, a Swiss company developing smart containers for transporting medicines and vaccines, is announcing a significant round of funding. On top of a $62 million round that closed last year, the company has now raised a $35 million Series C to improve shipping of temperature-sensitive drugs &#8212; including COVID-19 vaccines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which is a combination of equity and debt financing, lists investors from the Middle East, including DisruptAD and (the VC arm of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund), and SHUAA (a major UAE asset management and investment banking firm). The investment also includes, per the company, “China-based” and Zurich-based family offices,” and investment from Mobiliar, a major private Swiss insurance company. </span></p>
<p>This round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $133 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, SkyCell has developed a shipping container that maintains temperature, controls vibration and is outfitted with sensors that continuously report the status of the cargo. The idea is to minimize temperature excursions &#8212; harmful fluctuations that can spoil drug products &#8212; and other damage that happens during shipping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An oft-cited number in the vaccine logistics community comes from a </span><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/68463/WHO_VB_03.18.Rev.1_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2005 World Health Organization report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting that as much as 50% of vaccines are wasted &#8212; partially thanks to temperature, logistics and shipping issues. The biopharma industry uses more optimistic numbers. SkyCell co-founder and CEO Richard Ettl says the industry typically factors in about a 4% failure rate for established markets and 12% failure rate for emerging markets when it ships drugs around the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, SkyCell’s temperature excursion rate is less than .1%, according to an </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/new-audit-reaffirms-skycells-high-performance-efficiency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outside audit of the technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/skycell-raises-62m-for-smart-containers-and-analytics-to-transport-pharmaceuticals/">last covered</a> SkyCell back in April 2020, the company had been working with eight major pharmaceutical companies and was in trials with seven more. The company now “works with the majority of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies,” per a PR representative &#8212; though the company wouldn’t provide further details. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before COVID-19, the company was delivering about 250 million vials of pharmaceutical products per year across all customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the technology has moved forward in one big way: It’s been redesigned to be able to transport mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the raw materials needed to make them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly designed containers use dry ice &#8212; a necessity to achieve the temperatures about -80 to -60 degrees Celsius preferred (but </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-allows-more-flexible-storage-transportation-conditions-pfizer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no longer always required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to transport vaccines like Pfizer’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to ultra-cold vaccine shipping, dry ice is basically unavoidable. (UPS Healthcare makes its own dry ice and has been <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/ups-dry-ice-pfizer-vaccine-coronavirus-stirling-ultracold/589723/">upping production</a> to meet COVID-19 vaccine demand). SkyCell’s tech, says Ettl, uses far less of it than competitors. It uses </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/skycell-introduces-revolutionary-new-deep-frozen-container-the-1500df/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 kilograms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of dry ice for about 120 hours of use, though it can store vaccines longer, if more dry ice is added upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The competition would need 200 kilos or more of dry ice,” he says. “So that was a major feat of engineering.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says the company is now transporting either raw materials or vaccines for three top COVID-19 vaccine makers (he did not disclose which ones &#8212; though by the ultra cold temperature requirements, you might be able to guess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two [of the three] we almost exclusively transport the raw material that comes out of the factory,” he says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major step forward is the company’s expansion from flying into trucking services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many vaccines first arrive in countries via plane, it’s often trucks that bring vaccines to central medical warehouses. Ideally these trucks are refrigerated, but those aren’t always available, which means that cold boxes and large-scale hauler trucks get used instead, according to a</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/port-to-patient-improving-country-cold-chains-for-covid-19-vaccines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2021 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion into trucking greatly increases the reach of SkyCell’s vaccine distribution network. The company has been involved in European distribution of vaccines for one major vaccine player, Ettl says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before we were not doing trucking,” says Ettl. “Our container is used on trucks to transport these -80 Celsius and very cold temperature [products] around. So this was definitely a big change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says that COVID-19 vaccine shipping will likely continue to play a role in the company’s future. But it’s not the core of their business. Many pharmaceutical products, from cancer drugs to other vaccines, require cold-chain handling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Air Transport Association’s Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics </span><a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/494bc14afd934b0193735e9a47091d72/iata_ceiv-pharma_how20to20become20ceiv20pharma20certified.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">world sales of cold-chain drugs and biologics will surpass $440 billion by 2024 &#8212; and that doesn’t include COVID-19 vaccine spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that industry, there also appear to be three macro-trends, the report continues. There are an increasing number of container reuse services, and development of more recyclable shipping containers, and finally the use of electronics to track shipments in real time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, SkyCell overlaps with all of these trends. The fact that SkyCell’s container is reusable is a “major driver” that has helped the company obtain pharmaceutical partnerships, Ettl says. The company has also installed sensors within the boxes, and collects a constellation of data points on every shipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl believes that SkyCell is poised to respond to industry-level changes and increasing demand for cold-chain products. So far, the numbers seem to be in the company’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have never lost the product in the company&#8217;s history,” he says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As last week came to a close, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001625278/000162828021019876/nerdwallets-1.htm">NerdWallet filed to go public</a>. Given the late hour, our S-1 dive had to wait until today.</p>
<p>The NerdWallet IPO comes at an interesting time. The company provides financial product recommendations to both consumers and SMBs, meaning that it dabbles in the same market that fintech startups play in. And because NerdWallet is essentially a weaponized content play, we get to talk about the value of the written word.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>NerdWallet is pursuing a traditional IPO, meaning that it will raise primary capital in its public debut. Per its filing, the company intends to &#8220;use approximately $29.0 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay all outstanding principal amounts and accrued interest under certain promissory notes.&#8221; The rest will go to running and growing the company, or what lawyers like to call &#8220;general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The NerdWallet IPO is a liquidity event for several investing groups, including Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which owns 17.5% of Class A stock ahead of the company&#8217;s public offering, RRE Ventures (6.5% of pre-IPO shares) and iGlobe Partners (6.0%). (Crunchbase has more regarding the company&#8217;s private fundraising history <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nerdwallet/company_financials">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We want to know how COVID-19 impacted NerdWallet&#8217;s growth, how quickly it is expanding revenues in 2021, its historical profitability and recent trends thereof and how the company manages to stay trustworthy, a question that we&#8217;ll address through the lens of editorial independence. Sound good? Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 and NerdWallet</h2>
<p>The pandemic was not kind to NerdWallet, but because the firm had variable costs it could constrain, wasn&#8217;t disastrous to its overall business.</p>
<p>NerdWallet generated $228.3 million in revenues in 2019, a figure that rose only modestly to $245.3 million in 2020. For a venture-backed company, posting growth of around 7.5% can be lethal. At that pace of growth, who&#8217;d want to back a startup?</p>
<p>More recently, growth has sped back up, with NerdWallet posting $137.3 million in H1 2020 revenues, a figure that expanded to $181.6 in the first half of 2021. The latter figure represents growth of just over 32%, a much healthier number than what the company recorded in 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic is partially to blame for NerdWallet&#8217;s slack 2020 growth. Here&#8217;s the company discussing what COVID-19 did to certain lines of its business:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is expanding its investment in audio initiatives with the launch of a new &#8220;Audio&#8221; destination in its mobile app in the U.S., where users will be able to discover in one place all the audio formats Facebook now hosts, including podcasts, Live Audio Rooms and short-form audio. The company says it&#8217;s also making its Clubhouse rival, Live Audio Rooms, more broadly available to global users, and is beginning to roll out a new product called Soundbites, a sort of TikTok for audio offering short audio clips.</p>
<p>An early version of the new Audio destination has been in the process of rolling out to all Facebook users (18 and up) in the U.S. across both iOS and Android, but is being officially announced now. It can be accessed through the top navigation within Watch, Facebook&#8217;s video hub &#8212; a design choice that feels a little incongruous, given that audio content is meant to be listened to, not &#8220;watched.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says the new destination will help creators to have their shows found, while Facebook users will be able to find audio content from favorite creators, discover new ones and access content they had saved for later. At launch, the Audio section will feature the content from the creators you&#8217;re already following, and will include a set of personalized recommendations as well as suggestions of other audio that&#8217;s popular across Facebook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The destination will become more personalized to your own tastes and interests over time, as you engage with the audio content and follow more creators, Facebook notes.</p>
<p>Timed with this launch, Facebook offered an update on the work it&#8217;s been doing to expand access to more of its audio products.</p>
<p>This spring, Facebook had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">introduced</a> a suite of new audio features, including its Clubhouse competitor called Live Audio Rooms, as well as the short-form audio product called Soundbites, plus support for podcasts. With Spotify, it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">partnered on a new miniplayer</a> that streams from the music service to users on Facebook.</p>
<p>Live Audio Rooms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">officially launched</a> in June to U.S. public figures in good standing with Facebook and to select Facebook Groups. Since then, Facebook said the feature has been found to work as a lightweight means of connection and conversation across communities, where it&#8217;s been adopted by creators including Lil Huddy, Noah and Miley Cyrus, quarterback Russell Wilson, singer Becky G, comedian Sherry Cola, Mereba Music and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2167905" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167905" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167905" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Now, Facebook says Live Audio Rooms are rolling out to more public figures and creators outside the U.S. as well as non-U.S.-based Facebook Groups. In addition to iOS, the feature has launched on Android, and the ability to listen to Live Audio has arrived on desktop, which makes it more accessible as it expands to other markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the short-form Soundbites product has been in testing since June with a group of emerging creators and others, including comedian and best-selling author Josh Sundquist; actress, disability advocate and lifestyle influencer Lolo Spencer; and digital creator Molly Burke. This test recently expanded to include more creators, and now, Facebook says Soundbites will roll out to more people in the U.S. in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The company also noted it&#8217;s been working on support for podcasts following its audio announcements earlier this year. This summer, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">made podcasts available to U.S. users</a>. More recently, it&#8217;s rolled out the ability to share short podcast clips in News Feed and added support captions on Android (with iOS still to come). Podcasters were additionally given the ability to add their RSS feeds to their Facebook Page on desktop and mobile. However, podcast listening remains still U.S.-only for the time being.</p>
<p>Facebook says as it&#8217;s been expanding its audio experiences, it&#8217;s been working on tools that would help to identify and act upon content that violates its Community Standards. This includes tools to automatically identify harmful content on Facebook. Plus, Facebook says it&#8217;s adapting both its technology and processes to detect and moderate violating audio content, as it learns more.</p>
<p>This new follows a tough week for Facebook, which not only included one of its longest outages to date, but also saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">whistleblower</a> testifying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">before the U.S. Senate</a> about the harms enabled by Facebook&#8217;s platform, including its engagement-based algorithms, inability to fight misinformation and corporate decision making that put profits above people. Facebook&#8217;s staff are now divided over the whistleblower&#8217;s testimony, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/technology/facebook-whistleblower-employees.html">The New York Times reported</a>. With Facebook now venturing deeper into audio and live audio &#8212; a difficult area to address from a moderation standpoint &#8212; Facebook could become a platform for more misinformation to spread if it&#8217;s not able to develop the necessary technology that would make audio a safe environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge declared last month that Apple was not a monopoly when issuing the court&#8217;s decision on California’s Epic Games v. Apple case. But the one area where Apple lost ground was in what sort of rules it can make for its own App Store. On this point, the judge sided with Epic Games, saying that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">Apple can no longer prohibit developers</a> from pointing to other means of payment beyond Apple&#8217;s own payment systems. Now, Apple is appealing that decision and asking for a stay on the injunction the judge had put into place. The move could delay any sort of changes to the App Store&#8217;s rules until a final decision is made after the appeals case has been decided.</p>
<p>Apple had been ordered to update its App Store policies to stop prohibiting developers from including external links and other calls to action inside their apps that could direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to in-app purchasing. Apple could also not stop developers from communicating with customers through points of contact they obtained voluntarily from customers through their app&#8217;s registration, the injunction said.</p>
<p>This is in line with other settlements Apple has recently made both inside and outside the U.S., including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">one with a Japanese regulator</a> which changed its policy for &#8220;reader apps,&#8221; allowing them to add a link to their website inside their apps. South Korea also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed a bill</a> that will prevent Apple and Google from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">a recent class-action settlement</a> with developers in the U.S., Apple clarified that developers could use communications, like emails, to share information about alternative payment methods with their iOS customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the Epic Games ruling, however, Apple was required to put into place the new rules within 90 days of the court&#8217;s decision on September 10, 2021. Some in the market were already moving forward to capitalize on that potential change. For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> somewhat prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple&#8217;s own as soon as the injunction went into effect.</p>
<p>If Apple wins the stay, the early December deadline to comply with the injunction will be discarded as the appeals case is argued in court. That means there could be no changes for App Store developers for many months to come.</p>
<p>Apple won nearly every point in the Epic Games battle except for this one minor point related to its &#8220;anti-steering&#8221; rules. But Apple was going to be forced to return to court anyway, due to Epic&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p>Despite winning the ability to add links to alternative payment methods, Epic Games was unsatisfied with the court&#8217;s original decision, which declared that Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221; It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">had filed an appeal</a> of its own back in mid-September, with the hope of convincing the appeals court that Apple was acting as a monopolist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The battle between the two tech giants continues to wage outside the courtroom, as well. Last week, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney pointed out, via a post on Twitter, how Apple was using its platform to market its own apps to customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-calls-out-apple-for-promoting-its-services-in-the-iphone-settings-screen/">within the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen</a> &#8212; effectively an ad slot that third-party competitors didn&#8217;t have access to, he said. The company declined to say if it would bring up this point in a later trial, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p dir="ltr">Fraud continues to be a major issue in the world of digital transactions, a situation that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/enterprise-solutions-real-cost-online-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> was only compounded in the last 20 months of online activity growing as a result of COVID-19. Today, a Melboune startup called FrankieOne that has built an automated platform to help combat that is announcing a Series A on the back of strong customer demand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company &#8212; which harnesses some 350 data sources to verify automatically people&#8217;s identities when onboarding, and then monitor subsequent activity for fraudulent behavior &#8212; has raised $16 million (AUS$20 million). It plans to use the money to grow its footprint internationally after seeing strong demand in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FrankieOne has picked up some 80 customers in the last 18 months, bringing its total to 90, including the likes of Afterpay, Westpac and Zipmex. It also saw its annual recurring revenue grow 20-fold in the last year, with half of those sales coming from outside of its home country (but it isn&#8217;t disclosing actual revenue numbers). Notably, FrankieOne has gotten to this point with no marketing or sales team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">That traction has also caught the attention of some high-profile investors. Australia&#8217;s AirTree Ventures and Greycroft, from the U.S., co-led the round, with 20VC, Reinventure, Tidal Ventures, APEX Capital and Mantis (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/the-chainsmokers-just-closed-their-debut-venture-fund-mantis-with-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VC fund started</a> by music act The Chainsmokers) also participating. Individuals in this Series A include Robinhood founder and CEO Vlad Tenev, Monzo founder Tom Blomfield and senior executives from Revolut and Public.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FrankieOne identified a critical challenge through its firsthand experience as a fintech startup. Simon Costello and Aaron Chipper co-founded the startup, which was originally called Frankie, in 2017 as a neobank hoping to ride the wave of disruptive fintechs out of Europe that were giving banks a run for their money in winning over younger consumers with more user-friendly, mobile-first options for saving, investing, managing, borrowing and spending money. That may have been ahead of its time for the Australian market, but in the process they also discovered one of the big growing pains for getting a business like that off the ground. There was no efficient way to screen and onboard new users, and subsequently make sure they were transacting on their platforms in a legal way.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Our journey to building a neobank revealed a single connection for onboarding simply didn’t exist,&#8221; said Costello in an emailed interview.</p>
<p>That became the focus of the company&#8217;s pivot (and Costello said that Frankie gave back all the money it took from investors in that first effort).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We decided to scratch our own itch and built it ourselves. We knew we had found a market niche when this platform also met the needs of our peers. As we pivoted, we quickly found that our first customers were all Australian NeoBanks such as Volt Bank,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;This experience allowed us to understand banking from the inside out, and realise that for existing financial institutions, as well as emerging fintech, regulatory compliance is the single biggest challenge these companies face.&#8221;</p>
<p>The year was 2019, and the timing turned out to be fortuitous. The pandemic has led to an explosion in the amount and breadth of online transactions. And whether that activity was via financial services or e-commerce or something else, more people and organizations doing business online has meant more fragmentation, more transactions and mainly more money for fraudsters to target.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, this is not an untapped area of financial technology. There are a number of companies in the market today building &#8220;fraud prevention as a service&#8221; and providing it to those companies that need it to run their own businesses. The list includes Alloy (which in September was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/alloy-raises-100m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-help-banks-and-fintechs-fight-fraud-with-its-api-based-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1.35 billion</a> in its latest funding round), idwall (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/brazils-idwall-raises-38m-for-identity-validation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $38 million</a>), Rapyd (a multipurpose financial services toolkit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $8.75 billion</a>), Stripe (the payments giant that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has made a big move</a> into onboarding, identity and fraud management) and many others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Costello points out that among FrankieOne&#8217;s unique selling points is its particularly international profile, with data-sources offered currently into 46 different countries, which he noted &#8220;speaks to the global nature of this platform, and its inherent potential to scale.&#8221; In contrast, he added that other providers of know-your-customer and anti-money laundering services tend to be region-specific. &#8220;Very few, if any, have the capacity to service multinational enterprises that require a nuanced approach to regulation, compliance, and digital identity based on the specific requirement of that geography.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Helping with this is that, while Frankie the startup (like other neobanks) might have relied heavily on APIs from third parties to power the services it provided to customers, FrankieOne sits on the other side of that relationship. It has built its own technology stack, Costello said, &#8220;much of which was informed by the compliance and regulatory sophistication required to operate a bank.&#8221; It also does integrate APIs directly into FrankieOne &#8212; the data sources, for example, that power its fraud management and identity verification system, which will also grow in number as FrankieOne continues to expand. It is, for example, going to be offering transaction monitoring for both fiat and cryptocurrencies later this year, and the fact that it&#8217;s already providing services to customers like Zipmex gives it an opening into doing more around fraud prevention in the still quite wild cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know your customer (KYC) and digital identity verification are board-level issues for financial services companies,&#8221; said John Henderson, a partner at AirTree Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;The current, manual systems used by fintechs and FTSE100 companies alike are both bespoke and broken. The world needs a better solution, and we believe <span class="il">FrankieOne</span> provides it. After seeing the incredible progress and undeniable traction Simon and the team have had, we&#8217;re excited to be leading their Series A as they position themselves to be the leading identity verification and fraud risk provider.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Financial services companies pay top dollar to acquire customers,&#8221; added Will Szczerbiak, partner at Greycroft. &#8220;Upon signup, customers undergo a series of checks—including KYC, identity verification, and anti-fraud—that can force companies to turn away potentially great customers because of reliance on inadequate systems. <span class="il">FrankieOne</span>’s APIs extracts the complexity away, allowing their clients to onboard more great customers while delivering a delightful end user experience. It is a unique approach that scales globally, and we are excited about the partnership”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.swile.co">Swile</a> has raised a $200 million Series D funding round led by SoftBank International Group. With this funding round, the startup has now reached unicorn status, meaning that Swile has a valuation of $1 billion or more. Swile provides a payment card for employee benefits, such as meal vouchers, gift cards and sustainable mobility vouchers.</p>
<p>Michel Combes, SoftBank International Group’s president (pictured left), is joining Swile’s board. Some of the startup’s existing investors are participating once again, such as Eurazeo, Index Ventures and Bpifrance. Headline is also investing in Swile for the first time.</p>
<p>This is a significant round for the company as it keeps raising bigger rounds year after year. Swile raised a Series A round of $17.4 million (€15 million) in 2018, a Series B round of $34.7 million (€30 million) in 2019 and a Series C round of $81 million (€70 million) in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Swile started as a payment card to hold your meal vouchers. In France, companies have to contribute to lunch when it’s in the middle of a work day. Some companies offer a cafeteria with cheap meals, others hand out meal vouchers that you can spend in restaurants and bakeries.</p>
<p>But the experience is a bit confusing when you’re paying for lunch. Employees often ask whether a restaurant accepts meal vouchers. And if you want to spend more than your daily budget, you have to use two cards.</p>
<p>With Swile, employees can optionally add their personal debit card to the Swile app. When you spend more than your daily limit, Swile automatically charges your personal card. It’s a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>And this product alone has been quite successful. Just four years after launch, Swile has captured a 13% market share on meal vouchers in France. It competes with well-established companies, such as Edenred, UpDéjeuner, Sodexo’s Pass Restaurant and Apetiz. Swile generates revenue on interchange fees and on commission on affiliates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to small and medium companies, the startup has managed to convince bigger clients, such as supermarket chain Carrefour and its 65,000 employees in France. Other clients include Doctolib, Spotify and Airbnb in France.</p>
<p>“Our bet with Swile — as we disclosed it 18 months ago — is that we want to go beyond lunch and manage employee benefits with the Swile card. It should help you manage all your employee benefits,” Swile founder and CEO Loïc Soubeyrand told me.</p>
<p>For instance, employee representatives usually offer gift cards for the end of the year. Instead of handing out paper checks, the employee representative bodies can top up the Swile card with those gift cards. After that, the employee can use the same card for lunch and for Christmas presents. Swile has acquired <a href="https://www.sweevana.com">Sweevana</a> for that part of the business.</p>
<p>Similarly, Swile will soon let you pay for ridesharing, public transport subscriptions or bike rides between your home and your office. In France, this is a nascent market, as companies will have to contribute to sustainable mobility spendings starting on January 1.</p>
<p>“This is what’s great with unification. You don’t need five different cards to manage five different benefits,” Soubeyrand said. And companies don&#8217;t need five solutions with five different suppliers either.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215960" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215960" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2215960" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215960" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swile</p></div></p>
<h2>From a super card to a super app</h2>
<p>Beyond the Swile card and its transactional revenue, the startup wants to build an app to improve internal communications, run anonymous surveys and gather feedback from employees. This could open up some revenue opportunities with a software-as-a-service approach and monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>The company has been testing its app in beta for the last 12 months and it should be available to Swile clients soon. Swile has acquired Briq for its expertise on that area.</p>
<p>In the future, small companies could also imagine managing their corporate spending from Swile. You don’t necessarily need a full-fledged, separate solution to manage expenses when you’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Up next, Swile also has ambitious international goals. Brazil is by far the biggest market when it comes to employee benefits. With the acquisition of Vee Benefícios, Swile now has 120 employees in São Paulo and it wants to turn Brazil into its main market.</p>
<p>By 2022, Swile wants to hire 500 employees — the company will double in size. There will be more international expansions as well. Mexico looks like another promising market, for instance. Even if those international bets take time to pay off, Swile is still just getting started in its home market. It still has a tiny market share and a lot of room for growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit announced today that it has hired Pali Bhat, the former vice-president of product and design at Google Cloud, as the company’s first chief product officer. Bhat will be tasked with overseeing Reddit’s product organization and leading the development of tools and features for the platform.</p>
<p>In his new role, Bhat will report directly to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. Bhat will lead and facilitate the creation of tools and features focused on bringing &#8220;community and belonging&#8221; to Reddit, the company said.</p>
<p>Bhat brings over 15 years of expertise in leading teams and products across developer platforms and consumer services, including several Google flagship services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
