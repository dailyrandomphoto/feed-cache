										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many brands are using the messaging app Discord to forge a sense of community among their fans. If the fast-food chain <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wendys">Wendy&#8217;s</a> can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?</p>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_us/status/1471208467251834880">teased on Twitter</a> that it was making a Discord server, but then confirmed the news on its own app today. Now, on TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tiktok">brand new Discord</a>, you can chat with strangers about&#8230; whatever you&#8217;d want to talk to a bunch of TikTokers about. Maybe the best way to make Emily Mariko&#8217;s <a href="https://www.insider.com/emily-mariko-salmon-rice-recipe-tiktok-ice-cube-2021-9#emily-marikos-content-has-exploded-on-tiktok-over-the-past-two-weeks-1">viral salmon recipe</a>?</p>

<p>&#8220;This server’s just like your for you feed: it’s made for you, some of its comments are spicy, and your parents have no idea what it is,&#8221; TikTok wrote in the Discord&#8217;s welcome channel. Some of the rules on the Discord include no NSFW content and no buying crypto. Before chatting, you have to indicate by selecting a check-mark reaction that you read the rules &#8212; this is common in popular Discords to discourage spam. There&#8217;s even an option to indicate your gender pronouns on your server profile.</p>
<p>As of publication, there are only 400 people in the Discord, which TikTok told TechCrunch is a &#8220;soft launch.&#8221; There are 5 moderators from TikTok, which could pose a problem if the server continues to grow. As one user said, &#8220;let&#8217;s take the advantage [to talk to each other] when there are not 300,000 people trying to chat at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent spam (which is also against the rules), TikTok is using &#8220;slowmode,&#8221; a Discord feature that only lets people send a message every 30 seconds. But users quickly got around the slowmode by making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/discord-threads/">threads</a>, where the time limit between messages doesn&#8217;t apply. Soon after, moderators removed the ability to make threads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Right now, the conversation channels on the TikTok Discord are relatively ordinary, expect for some light trolling. There are chats for introducing yourself, sharing your TikToks, TikTok support, server feedback, TikTok sounds, and more. There&#8217;s even a &#8220;game room,&#8221; indicating TikTok&#8217;s growing interest in gaming &#8212; right now, the platform is testing a desktop streaming software called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/">TikTok Live Studio</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is leaving the company, its parent company General Motors said in late afternoon statement.</p>
<p>Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company&#8217;s first CEO will take over the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise&#8217;s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former Chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said.</p>
<p>GM and Cruise did not provide additional details about why Ammann was leaving. The departure of the longtime GM executive is unexpected and came as a surprise to Cruise employees who asked not to be identified.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ammann was at the center of GM&#8217;s initial investment and acquisition of Cruise. He oversaw GM&#8217;s relationship with Cruise. And he was the person with whom Vogt had regular contact. Vogt even mentioned his connection to Ammann while onstage at SF Disrupt in September 2018. Ammann also came to the job with a specific skill set. When Ammann first joined GM in 2010 as vice president of finance and treasurer, his first task was to manage GM&#8217;s initial public offering. At the time, Ammann&#8217;s appointment as Cruise CEO seemed to signal that an IPO could be a goal.</p>
<p>Ammann was tapped to be CEO of Cruise in late 2018. He took over officially in January 2019. At the time, the move seemed to make sense. Cruise had grown from a small startup with 40 employees to more than 1,000 by the time Ammann took over.</p>
<p>And while Ammann continued to push the company to expand, there were missed targets, notably the plan to launch a commercial robotaxi business in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is the latest company to <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce</a> a Spotify Wrapped-like personalized end-of-year recap feature. The streaming service is giving subscribers the option to learn more about their viewing habits through a new <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Your TV DNA&#8221; tool</a>. The tool is accessible on a newly launched website where users can access a profile of their personalized viewing habits throughout the year. The tool analyzes users&#8217; streaming habits and shares information about things like their most-watched genres and how many films and TV show episodes they watched.</p>
<p>To get started, subscribers need to log into their Hulu accounts on the website in order to receive their recap. From there, the tool will analyze the user&#8217;s data and then display their most-watched genres, which can include categories like edgy comedies, high-stakes dramas, crime dramas and more. The recap will also include a &#8220;streaming persona&#8221; that&#8217;s meant to represent the user&#8217;s viewing habits of the year.</p>
<p>The tool also aims to help users discover recommendations about what they should watch next on the streaming service. The recommendations include upcoming or current content that is similar to what the user has already watched. Users also have the option to share their recap with others on social media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249020" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This year, for the first time, Hulu is giving subscribers the opportunity to request to see their own viewing DNA and the tools to proudly share, should they so choose, their streaming persona,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> regarding the announcement. &#8220;Starting today, subscribers can visit <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2">YourTVDNA.com</a> and request to see their personalized Hulu viewing habits throughout 2021.&#8221;</p>

<div class="article-content">
<p>The launch of the new feature comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it’s no surprise that other companies are mimicking the popular features. Hulu joins many other digital giants that have released their own Wrapped-like features. Last week, Facebook and Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/"> introduced</a> personalized &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; features to give users a way to reflect on the past year. Reddit also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/reddit-rolls-out-personalized-end-of-year-recaps-with-stats-about-users-habits/">rolled out</a> personalized recaps with stats about users’ habits last week; meanwhile, Snapchat launched its “Year End Story” this week.</p>
<p>In addition to the personalized recaps, Hulu also released information about overall trends on its platform. The company revealed that &#8220;Only Murders in the Building&#8221; was its most-watched comedy series and that &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers&#8221; set a new record as its most-watched series ever. Hulu also notes that adult animation was the No. 1 genre on the streaming service based on hours watched.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also outlined that the most streamed day of 2021 was Sunday, January 31, largely because subscribers tuned into the previous evening’s &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; episode hosted by John Krasinski. In terms of non-original series, the most-watched medical drama was &#8220;The Good Doctor,&#8221; which also topped this category in 2020. Other popular non-Original series included &#8220;Law &amp; Order: SVU&#8221; and &#8220;Modern Family.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian will use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it publicly listed its shares to build a second factory in Georgia that has double the capacity of its plant in Illinois.</p>
<p>The company, which made the announced Thursday as part of its first earnings report, said the funds will be used to expand production capacity of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year. Its second factory will be built east of Atlanta in Morgan and Walton counties and will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year.</p>
<p>This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. The company <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/3BYl8sLO3rzD9lluEwvXGE/754d4115dc0715d7e95e848556fc93cb/Rivian-Q3-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">said in its shareholder letter</a> that it picked the site due to the combination of sustainable business operations, talent pool, and proximity to supply chain and logistics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As we look ahead, our Georgia facility will be critically important to our objective to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable transportation,&#8221; the letter said, adding that the facility will be used for our next generation of vehicles.</p>
<p>In the near-term, that capital will also be used to design and develop its next generation of vehicles. To date, Rivian has three vehicles: the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which are aimed at consumers, and its commercial van. Amazon, which holds more than 20% of Rivian stock, is the company&#8217;s first commercial van customer with an initial 100,000 vehicle order.</p>
<p>Rivian will also invest heavily in vertical integration, which follows the company and its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe&#8217;s strategy over the past several years. Specifically, Rivian intends to invest in battery technology across the value chain, including battery cell chemistry development, raw material sourcing, and in-house cell manufacturing, the company said in its shareholder letter.</p>
<p>The electric drive system will be another investment priority. The aim, the company said, is to advance its &#8220;in-house family of future drive units offering higher performance, improved packaging, and lower cost.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Generating sales is of course at the top of the to-do list, which Rivian plans to increase by continuing to invest in customer engagement and experiences, including its &#8220;experience spaces,&#8221; the Rivian membership program for consumers and its digital fleet management software that is branded FleetOS for its commercial customers.</p>
<p>Rivian outlined plans to build out its vehicle service and charging infrastructure. By the end of the year, Rivian said it will have more than 60 mobile service vans in service and eight service centers located in California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Utah, and Washington.</p>

<p>The Internet Association has fought for tech&#8217;s interests in Washington for the last nine years, lobbying lawmakers to advance the combined interests of Facebook, Amazon, Google, Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, eBay, Spotify, Zillow and many more of the most recognizable names in tech, from the largest companies on down. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/14/silicon-valleys-voice-in-washington-to-dissolve-524486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico first reported</a> that the group would close up shop.</p>
<p>“Our industry has undergone tremendous growth and change since the Internet Association was formed almost 10 years ago, and in line with this evolution, the Board has made the difficult decision to close the organization at the end of this year,&#8221; the group wrote in a published statement. &#8220;&#8230; IA has made great progress on its mission to foster innovation, promote economic growth, and empower people through a free and open internet.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In recent years, some of the Internet Association&#8217;s members have come into direct conflict on policy issues. That rift appears to be widening on defining topics, even among the group&#8217;s biggest members. While the IA&#8217;s stated position defends keeping Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act intact as it stands now, IA member Meta (now parent company of Facebook) recently told lawmakers that it&#8217;s open to changing the law in order to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">&#8220;earn some of our Section 230 protections.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The group represents its members on issues like AI, broadband, content moderation and privacy, but conspicuously stayed out of the antitrust debate — the most relevant, consequential policy conversation in the industry&#8217;s recent history. With lawmakers gearing up to impose new regulations on tech companies, antitrust will continue to eclipse most other policy concerns that affect both major players in tech and the smaller companies that point to concerns around their market dominance.</p>
<p>Yelp, which joined the Internet Association in 2014, left previously due to differences with the group. &#8220;This org could’ve saved itself years ago by kicking out everyone with a market cap greater than $500b (ie GAFA),: Yelp Senior Public Policy VP<a href="https://twitter.com/lutherlowe/status/1470941101821472772?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Luther Lowe tweeted</a>. &#8220;I made this suggestion to the leadership a few years ago, but it was shot down, so we quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yelp has testified before Congress on antitrust issues, arguing that Google, previously a fellow IA member, is a monopoly that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742386857/yelp-ceo-discusses-his-efforts-to-convince-congress-that-google-is-a-monopoly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfairly gives search preference to its own products</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, longtime IA president Michael Beckerman left<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/"> to join TikTok</a> as the company&#8217;s head of public policy in the Americas. <a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-uber-leaving-internet-association-eed2477d-dc04-47c7-8d90-760d32d7b3f3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft and Uber</a> both left the group last month, signaling IA&#8217;s waning usefulness in the current tech policy landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While NSO Group was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">taking flak</a> for hacking into the phones of journalists, activists and human rights defenders, an entire class of spyware makers and surveillance-for-hire outfits were operating as normal, largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>These private surveillance groups develop and deploy never-before-seen exploits that quietly hack into and steal the contents of a victim&#8217;s phone — call logs, text messages, emails, location data and more — often on behalf of authoritarian governments targeting their most vocal critics.</p>
<p>Now, following an investigation by researchers at Citizen Lab and Facebook&#8217;s new parent company, Meta, seven surveillance-for-hire groups have been banned from using the social media giant&#8217;s platforms to target other users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Thursday</a> that it has removed more than 1,500 Facebook and Instagram accounts associated with the seven outfits, which the company said were used for reconnaissance, social engineering and sending malicious links to thousands of victims in over 100 countries. Meta said it&#8217;s notified around 50,000 people it believes were targeted by the seven groups.</p>
<p>Although much of the recent focus of the surveillance industry has been on companies like NSO Group, both Citizen Lab and Meta warned that the wider surveillance-for-hire industry will continue to balloon if left unregulated. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to realize that NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary ecosystem,&#8221; according to a report of Meta&#8217;s investigation seen by TechCrunch before its publication.</p>
<p>One of the banned companies is Cytrox, a North Macedonia-based spyware maker. Meta said it found the company using a &#8220;vast&#8221; infrastructure of web domains mimicking legitimate news sites to target the iPhone and Android devices of its victims. Meta said it sent legal notices to Cytrox and blocked hundreds of domains associated with its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Meta was acting on findings by Citizen Lab, which also on Thursday released a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forensic report</a> into the hacking of phones belonging to two Egyptians living in exile — a former politician and the host of a popular news show who asked not to be named. Citizen Lab said the spyware that infected their phones in July 2021, dubbed Predator, was developed by Cytrox.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab first discovered the spyware on the iPhone belonging to Ayman Nour, an Egyptian politician and outspoken critic of the incumbent president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took over the country following a military coup in 2013. Nour, who lives in exile in Turkey, became suspicious when his phone was &#8220;running hot.&#8221; Citizen Lab found that Nour&#8217;s phone had been infected with Pegasus, the now-infamous spyware created by NSO Group. That led to the discovery that his phone had been concurrently hit by the newly discovered Predator spyware.</p>
<p>Both Nour&#8217;s phone and the phone belonging to the host of the news show were running iOS 14.6, the latest version of iOS at the time of the hacks, suggesting the spyware made use of a never-before-seen exploit in the iPhone&#8217;s software to infect the phones. Apple spokesperson Scott Radcliffe declined to say whether the company had fixed the vulnerability.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Predator shares a similar set of features to NSO&#8217;s Pegasus. Citizen Lab said Nour was sent a malicious link over WhatsApp. When opened, the spyware can access a phone&#8217;s cameras and microphone and can exfiltrate the phone&#8217;s data. Predator — unlike Pegasus — lacks the ability to silently infect a phone without any user interaction, but it makes up for that with persistence. Citizen Lab said the spyware can survive a reboot of an iPhone — typically clearing any spyware lurking in its memory — by creating an automation using the Shortcuts feature built into iOS.</p>
<p>The researchers said that, &#8220;remarkably,&#8221; Nour&#8217;s phone was compromised at the same time with both Pegasus and Predator, but that the infections were likely unrelated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the slapdash nature of Predator&#8217;s code, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re looking at the B Team here,&#8221; said Bill Marczak, one of the Citizen Lab researchers who discovered and analyzed the Predator malware. &#8220;Even so, Predator was still able to break into the latest, fully up-to-date phones, so it&#8217;s no surprise that we found repressive governments, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as Predator operators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it was likely that Predator is being used by government customers in Armenia, Greece, Serbia, Indonesia, Madagascar and Oman — plus Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are known to target their critics with mobile spyware. Meta, meanwhile, said its investigation found Predator customers in Vietnam, the Philippines and Germany.</p>
<p>Cytrox CEO Ivo Malinkovski could not be reached for comment; an email sent prior to publication bounced as undelivered.</p>
<p>Meta said that it also banned four other Israeli companies involved in the surveillance-for-hire business: Cobwebs, Cognyte, Black Cube and Bluehawk. In addition, it banned BellTrox, an Indian hacking outfit <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-mercenaries-exclusive/exclusive-obscure-indian-cyber-firm-spied-on-politicians-investors-worldwide-idUSKBN23G1GQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of hacking</a> into thousands of email accounts belonging to politicians and government officials, and a China-based spyware maker believed to be used by China&#8217;s law enforcement.</p>
<p>Although NSO has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">legal challenges</a> and restrictions on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">its business dealings</a> in large part because of accusations of abuse and spying on members of civil society — claims that the company has repeatedly denied — the social media giant warned that the growing surveillance industry continues to proliferate regardless.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to investigate and enforce against anyone abusing our apps,&#8221; Meta&#8217;s report said. &#8220;However, these cyber mercenaries work across many platforms and national boundaries. Their capabilities are used by both nation-states and private enterprises, and effectively lower the barrier to entry for anyone willing to pay. For their targets, it is often impossible to know they are being surveilled across the internet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1471552033912098818?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out</a> a new &#8220;Profile Embed&#8221; feature that allows users to embed a miniature version of their profile into a website. The new feature will allow users to further integrate their Instagram profiles into websites such as blogs and portfolios. The social media giant says the feature is currently only available in the U.S. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1471552033912098818?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> posted to Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been able to embed an Instagram photo or Instagram video into a website for many years now,&#8221; Mosseri explained in the video. &#8220;This extends on that idea and allows you to embed a miniature version of your Instagram profile on a website. Maybe you want to showcase your Instagram content on a website somewhere or link to someone else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>We’ve rolled out some pretty fun new features this week that I wanted to share with you: <br />&#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IGPlayback?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IGPlayback</a> <br />&#8211; Reels Visual Replies <br />&#8211; Profile Embed (US only for now) </p>

<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1471552033912098818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the video, Mosseri also outlined two more features that were announced earlier this week. The company launched a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/">“Reels Visual Replies” feature</a> that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they’ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply. The video reply will appear as a sticker. The new feature is similar to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s video replies</a>, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Considering the popularity of TikTok&#8217;s feature, it’s no surprise that Instagram launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone. Instagram also wasn&#8217;t the only one in doing so, as Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pinterest-rolls-out-the-option-to-reply-to-comments-with-videos/">rolled out</a> the option to allow users to reply to comments with videos a few days after Instagram announced its feature.</p>
<p>The third new feature mentioned in Mosseri&#8217;s video is a new end-of-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/">“Playback” IG Stories</a> time capsule feature. The feature leverages the platform&#8217;s Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for “several weeks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is continuing its investments in podcasts with today&#8217;s news that it has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/spotify-is-building-on-megaphones-capabilities-with-the-acquisition-of-whooshkaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> another podcast technology company, <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whooshkaa</a>, an Australia-based all-in-one platform for hosting, managing, distributing, promoting, monetizing and measuring podcasts. The deal follows Spotify&#8217;s earlier acquisitions in the podcast technology market, including last year&#8217;s deal for hosting and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">ad company Megaphone</a>, and, more recently, podcast discovery platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Podz</a>.</p>
<p>The company has also acquired creator-facing tools like Anchor and the live talk show platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">from Betty Labs,</a> now Spotify Greenroom, among other podcast studios like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts/">Gimlet</a>, Parcast and The Ringer.</p>
<p>With Whooshkaa, Spotify is gaining a new tool: specialized technology that allows radio broadcasters to easily turn their existing audio content into on-demand podcast programming. This is the part that most interested Spotify, which says it will integrate this &#8220;broadcast-to-podcast&#8221; tech directly into Megaphone &#8212; the latter which already offers a suite of hosting, distribution, reporting and monetization tools for podcasters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spotify believes Whooshkaa&#8217;s porting capability will bring more third-party content to its Spotify Audience Network, which would increase the reach and impact for its advertising partners. This part of Spotify&#8217;s business has been scaling upwards. The company passed the €1 billion in advertising revenue milestone in 2021 and Spotify reported its highest ad revenue quarter ever in Q3.</p>
<p>Today, 1 in 5 Spotify advertisers are using the Spotify Audience Network and opted-in Megaphone podcast publishers have seen a double-digit increase in fill rates, Spotify says.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, Whooshkaa has also innovated in areas like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, connected home integration, ad technology with dynamic insertion, enterprise-grade private podcasting tools and more, the Australian firm&#8217;s CEO Rob Loewenthal noted in its own <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/blog/the-next-step-for-whooshkaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on the company blog. However, Spotify &#8212; with its over 381 million monthly listeners &#8212; allows Whooshkaa to bring its technology to a larger audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the worldwide growth potential for digital audio is still largely untapped. Through the addition of these new tools as well as the innovative team behind them, we are reinforcing our commitment to helping creators, publishers, and advertisers realize the value of this opportunity,&#8221; said Spotify&#8217;s Chief Content &amp; Advertising Business Officer, Dawn Ostroff, in a statement about the deal. &#8220;With Whooshkaa, we will strengthen our efforts to help audio publishers of all kinds grow their podcast business and scale our ability to help advertisers reach their audiences.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spotify declined to share the deal terms, and couldn&#8217;t yet comment on the transition plan for Whooshkaa&#8217;s existing customers. A total of 12 people will be joining Spotify as a part of this deal, and they will remain based in Australia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oh, hey, before we get started this week, I’m excited to finally be able to tell you that TC Sessions: Robotics has been announced for next year, and we’re returning to the East Coast! I’ve been pushing for this for a while now &#8212; and not just because it’s a shorter flight for me. Berkeley has been great to us &#8212; and hey, it’s more or less home for me (one of these days I’ll find an excuse to talk about all of the shows I saw at Gilman St. in this newsletter).</p>
<p>But there’s just so much great stuff happening in my current time zone, that I’m extremely happy we’re doing it out east this year &#8212; and specifically Boston, where we held the first one, way back in 2017.</p>
<p>Like all the ones before it, the 2020 event in Berkeley was fantastic, back in early March 2020, before, you know, everything changed. There was no in-person Robotics Session this year, as the event planning gods probably correctly surmised that this is an event best held in person &#8212; because, well, robots.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/techcrunch-2022-events/">event is set for the Hynes Convention Center on July 22, 2022</a>. That’s all of the information I have for you at the moment, but you best believe I’m going to be shilling it in here as we get closer.</p>

<div class="cx-rec-module__header"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">All right, enough about 2022. We only have a few more weeks to continue dwelling on what’s left of 2021. As with last week, I plan to wrap up the year with some reflections on what this extraordinarily strange year has meant to the world of robotics. Before we get to more of my thoughts, here are some from Open Robotics co-founder and CEO, Brian Gerkey. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He has also worked at Willow Garage, the SRI Artificial Intelligence Center, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and the USC Interaction Lab.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021? </strong>The top three trends in robotics for 2021 are deployments, deployments and deployments. Whether its for safety reasons, labor shortages, increasing automation or all of the above, there have been a ton of robots and robot fleets deployed in the past year.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories? </strong>More deployments means more integration challenges. In 2022, companies will want their fleets working together. That means robots from different vendors are going to need to start communicating with each other because customers will demand it. Believe it or not, there was a time when a Mac computer couldn’t communicate with a PC. We’re at a similar stage in robotics, but the tools are in place to make integration possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246537" style="width: 4066px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246537" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2246537 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg" alt="" width="4056" height="2280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg 4056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4056px) 100vw, 4056px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246537" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Symbotic</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If you’ve been following this column over the past year, you know I’ve been extremely bullish on warehouse and fulfillment robotics. And the investment trends have really borne much of that out. I can’t take too much credit, of course. The writing has been on the wall for a while now for one giant reason&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>It’s the big question on the minds of every company in the online retail space &#8212; and, to an increasing degree, the world of parcel delivery. Amazon continues to be a Katamari Damacy ball of capitalism, hoovering up any companies and industries in its way, and leaving even its biggest competitors looking for some kind of edge. Robotics and automation offer some hope &#8212; though they represent another space where Amazon has developed its own edge.</p>
<p>The last number I saw &#8212; published over the summer &#8212; was 350,000 Amazon robots. It’s a number that continues growing. The promise of offering a way to maintain a competitive edge against Amazon’s army has led to some of the year’s biggest robotics investments. This week, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/walmart-supported-symbotic-set-to-go-public-via-softbank-spac/">Symbotic enlisted the support of Softbank in a bid to go public via SPAC</a>. In addition to raising $725 million for the firm, the deal will give Symbotic a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>A lot of that excitement is built around Walmart’s vote of confidence. In July, the mega-retailer announced an expansion of a pilot program that would bring Symbotic’s automation to 25 of its distribution centers over the next several years. Walmart is also an investor in the company, and if the deal closes in the first-half of next year as planned, it will own 9% of Symbotic. That’s strong support from a company like Walmart, which has been dipping its toes in various robotics verticals &#8212; just as Bossa Nova, which suffered serious consequences from an ended contract.</p>
<p>It’s hard to blame them for putting so many eggs in that basket. Walmart is the sort of behemoth that can make or break a startup with a well-timed partnership. And as for Walmart, few companies have more to lose from potentially having their respective lunches eaten by Amazon. The company missed a huge opportunity to own online retail early on, and ought to be seeking any advantage possible to make sure it’s got a future, as fewer and fewer people seek out in-store experiences.</p>
<p>That last bit is, no doubt, only being exacerbated by the pandemic. These past couple of years have been the final nail in the coffin for countless brick and mortars. Add to that workforce shortages, shutdowns and health concerns, and you’ve got a rapidly escalating list of reasons why so many companies are taking a much more sober look at automating their workforces, for better and worse.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even touch on the whole supply chain thing. When Jack White is launching a tour called “Supply Chain Issues,” you know this thing isn’t going to loosen its grip any time soon. That’s going to mean increased investment in parcel automation and, perhaps, a more serious re-examination of localized manufacturing.</p>
<p>The beginning of this year also saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/">Berkshire Grey announce a SPAC</a>, hot on the heels of a $263 million raise. Locus Robotics (which has insisted on a commitment to remaining independent) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/locus-robotics-just-raised-another-50m/">has raised a whole bunch of money</a>, while Fetch Robotics went ahead and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/fetch-robotics-ceo-on-the-companys-acquisition-and-the-future-of-warehouse-robots/">got acquired by Zebra Technologies</a>. As founder Melonee Wise told me in July:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it’s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO’ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn’t been a robotics company that’s IPO’ed through the traditional route.</p>
<p>I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there’s just not a history of robotics companies IPO’ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they’re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&amp;L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2246443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246443" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2246443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ForwardX / ForwardX&#8217;s AMR robots seen in a warehouse</p></div></p>
<p>While we’re primarily focused on U.S. transactions, this is certainly not a U.S.-only phenomenon. We’ve seen similarly large rounds in Europe and Asia, as well. Just this week. Beijing-based warehouse robotics firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/forwardx-warehoue-robot-series-c1/">ForwardX raised a $31 million Series C</a>, bringing its total funding to around $100 million. With a massive population and the aforementioned global supply chain issues, I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet that we’re only seeing the beginning of some massive rounds in China.</p>
<p>An under-discussed element in all of this are things like exoskeletons. They’re not specifically fulfillment tools, but wearable robotics like the newly announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/german-bionic-debuts-a-new-exoskeleton-with-upper-and-lower-body-assistance/">fifth-generation Cray X</a> from German Bionic are going to play a big role in the field. Thankfully, not every industry sees a near-term solution in full automation, so human workers are going to continue to play an important role.</p>
<p>That means both the introduction of more cobots and augmentation tools like exoskeletons, which have had a big year, including the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ottobock-set-to-acquire-fellow-robotic-exoskeleton-maker-suitx/">acquisition of SuitX by Ottobock</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/robotic-exoskeleton-maker-sarcos-announces-spac-plans/">Sarcos’ announced SPAC plans</a> and several big raises from companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/verve-motion-raises-15m-following-exosuit-pilot-with-grocery-workers/">like Verve Motion</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248206" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248206" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2248206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/egg.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>One more quick one this week comes from Stanford University. After sending its gecko-inspired robotic gripper to the International Space Station, the team continues to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/stanfords-gecko-inspired-robot-hand-sets-its-sights-on-fruit-picking/">find novel uses for the technology</a>. Highlighting an application called FarmHand, the team notes how the technology can be used to pick up fragile objects like eggs and fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,&#8221; Doctoroff wrote. &#8220;These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.&#8221;</p>
<div id="outstreamPlayer-inArticle" class="basePlayer expandedPlayer vp-docked-mode">
<div id="outstream-adText"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pebble is a vehicle sensor system designed to manage curb and parking space, and Delve is centered around bolstering real estate development with the help of AI. Mesa sensors are designed to help save energy, while Affordable Electrification is about managing home energy use. Canopy Buildings, meanwhile, focuses on &#8220;factory-automated mass timber construction.&#8221;</span></div>
<p>Doctoroff started Sidewalk Labs within Google six years ago and it later became its own company under the wing of Alphabet. In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-16-alphabet-google-sidewalk-labs-toronto-quayside.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">build a smart neighborhood on Toronto&#8217;s waterfront</a>. Quayside would have featured, among other things, delivery robots and an array of sensors to manage things like noise, traffic and pollution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248867" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, Sidewalk Labs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-sidewalk-labs-abandons-smart-neighborhood-project-in-toronto-201246140.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">shut down</a> the project in May last year. Doctoroff said at the time that “unprecedented economic uncertainty” as a result of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-sidewalk-quayside-waterfront-toronto-technical-evaluation.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">other compromises</a> it would have to make meant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-sidewalk-labs-site-plan-smart-neighborhood-quayside-toronto.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">its vision</a> for Quayside was no longer viable. The company also advised on development projects across North America.</p>
<p>Several companies were spun out of Sidewalk Labs, including Cityblock Health, which aims to reinvent health care for underserved communities; Replica, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-sidewalk-labs-replica-series-a-funding.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">a controversial data collection project</a> which aims to revamp transportation planning; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cavnue-michigan-corridor-221520625.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, which Doctoroff says &#8220;pioneered new forms of tech-enabled infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctoroff said he&#8217;s stepping aside after doctors determined it was likely that he has ALS or Lou Gherig&#8217;s Disease. He&#8217;s focusing on spending more time with his family and fighting the condition. In 2010, Doctoroff started an organization focused on building a new, collaborative approach to ALS research after the deaths of his father and uncle, who had both been diagnosed with the disease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco on Wednesday evening was in manual mode, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit. Waymo says the vehicle was in manual mode at the time, meaning the human safety driver who was behind wheel was actually driving.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/">Reddit post from KWillets</a> that described the event included a photo that showed a Waymo test vehicle parked in the Lower Haight neighborhood in San Francisco. A fire truck and several first responders are also shown at the scene. The post from KWillets, who describes witnessing the aftermath of the crash, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just when we thought 2021 couldn&#8217;t get worse, we heard a thump. I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Our neighbors had gotten out of a ride share on the far side and one crossed while the other stayed behind apparently taking a picture. An SFPD patrol stopped to say something to her about being careful crossing the street(?), when a Waymo passed in the near lane and hit the one who had already crossed, as I think he returned. The victim was conscious and standing afterwards, but went to SFGH for a more accurate diagnosis. Hope he&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can say there&#8217;s no such thing as Waymo, but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident was then picked up on Twitter, where it received more attention. In one exchange with <a href="https://twitter.com/kathbarna/status/1471449449146822657">well-known Tesla fan Omar Qazi</a>, who tweets under WholeMars Catalog, a Waymo spokesperson responded and said the vehicle was in manual mode.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Waymo, which also provided this statement:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday evening [12/15], one of our vehicles was involved in a manual collision in San Francisco on Haight St. midblock between Webster and Buchanan.The vehicle was being driven in manual mode when it made contact with a pedestrian in the road. The pedestrian was treated for injuries at the scene and was transported to the hospital in an ambulance. The trust and safety of the communities in which we drive are paramount to us, and we will continue investigating this incident in partnership with local authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates autonomous vehicles in the state. The collision occurred when the Waymo vehicle was on a &#8220;manual-only mission,&#8221; which means it does not meet the criteria for a reportable collision under the DMV&#8217;s AV testing regulations, a spokesperson said. However, Waymo will adhere to another DMV state regulation that requires all traffic crashes on roads that involve injuries or significant property damage to be reported.</p>
<p>Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in California for years, particularly in and around Mountain View and San Francisco. Waymo has been ramping up its testing activity in San Francisco, which has brought more attention to autonomous vehicles in general, and more specifically to the company. For example, Waymo found itself on the local news after a steady stream of the company&#8217;s self-driving cars kept going down the same dead end street, forcing them to make u-turns.</p>
<p>While Waymo doesn&#8217;t provide exact numbers on its autonomous vehicle fleet size, the company told TechCrunch it has &#8220;hundreds of vehicles in San Francisco. Its activity in San Francisco has increased in 2021, particularly since August when the company launched its <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/welcoming-our-first-riders-in-san.html">Trusted Tester program</a>, which opened up its research program beyond employees and to some members of the public. Under the program, San Franciscans are able to hail an autonomous ride in one of Waymo&#8217;s all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. A safety driver is still behind the wheel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever listened to a podcast, you&#8217;ve probably heard a host ask you to leave a review on Apple Podcasts in their end credits. Now, that script might flip to &#8220;leave a review on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it&#8217;s implementing a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-star rating system</a>, similar to Apple&#8217;s, in an attempt to improve podcast discovery. The company said this feature will roll out in the coming days in nearly all markets where podcasts are on Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify told TechCrunch that unlike Apple, this feature will only support star ratings at this time &#8212; you cannot yet write a written review of a show.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> that its intention is to &#8220;give listeners an opportunity to support their favorite podcast shows and enable a two-way feedback loop between creator and listener.&#8221; But, after seeking out five-star Apple reviews since the advent of the podcasting medium, podcasters are wary about how much star ratings actually help them promote their shows.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="https://eventualmillionaire.com/how-to-get-your-podcast-into-new-and-noteworthy-in-itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.weeditpodcasts.com/get-your-podcast-into-the-new-and-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> <a href="https://rachelcorbett.com.au/blog/new-and-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myth</a> in podcasting that getting lots of <a href="https://gaffincreative.com/how-to-get-featured-on-apple-podcasts-new-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratings</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/how-to-get-your-podcast-featured-in-itunes-new-and-noteworthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a> in your first few weeks after launch can improve your chances of getting listed on Apple Podcasts&#8217; coveted &#8220;New and Noteworthy&#8221; chart, which could jump-start your show&#8217;s growth. Besides, professional podcasters have pointed out that <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/852-ratings-and-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple itself says</a> that ratings and reviews don&#8217;t influence charting.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Far too many podcasters (and an embarrassing number of podcast consultants) still think ratings and reviews on Apple Podcasts influence rankings. They don&#39;t. They never have.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A representative from Spotify told TechCrunch, &#8220;Ratings are a great way for prospective listeners to quickly gauge a show’s quality, but at this point (as we&#8217;re in early days for this feature), a show&#8217;s rating is not factored into podcast charts or personalized recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is a tool to show what fans think of a podcast, but as of now, not something that can help shows get on Spotify&#8217;s charts or curated lists.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Anchor, the podcast creation platform that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Spotify bought</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in 2019, offered suggestions in a blog post about how podcasters can encourage listeners to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://blog.anchor.fm/updates/spotify-podcast-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leave a rating</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Do you like this show? Let us know by leaving us a rating on our Spotify show page,&#8221; one example says. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;As a creator, I can see this feels like a marketing move,&#8221; said Eric Silver, head of Creative at <a href="https://multitude.productions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multitude Productions</a>, an independent podcasting collective. &#8220;I don&#8217;t tell people to rate and review on Apple Podcasts at all because I know it doesn&#8217;t do anything other than make me feel good.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar marketing tactic to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/">Spotify Wrapped</a>, which trended across social media earlier this month &#8212; it&#8217;s fun to share your music and podcast listening habits with your friends, but at the same time, it&#8217;s a big PR success for Spotify.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify&#8217;s new rating system won&#8217;t impact distribution, Silver says that he will probably encourage listeners to rate Multitude shows on Spotify, at least for a few weeks. Spotify recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">surpassed</a> Apple Podcasts in U.S. podcast listenership &#8212; so if a large portion of potential audience members are going to see that rating right when they navigate to your show&#8217;s page, it makes sense to ask fans to rate your show.</p>
<p>YouTube, TikTok and other creative platforms show potential audience members, right off the bat, how many followers you have. But you don&#8217;t know how many downloads and subscribers a podcast has unless the podcaster tells you. Even though ratings and reviews are an indication of popularity, this differentiates the podcasting industry from other more algorithmically driven media, like video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Theoretically, the algorithm is supposed to help you. But isn&#8217;t this the tech conversation of our age?&#8221; said Silver. &#8220;It&#8217;s so complicated. It&#8217;s not just like, &#8216;Well, I wish there was an algorithm so there&#8217;s more discovery,&#8217; but then the opposite is when you have an issue like YouTube and TikTok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok are incentivized to make content that they think the algorithm likes, perhaps more so than what they think their audience will like. But even in media, that&#8217;s less algorithm-dependent; like podcasting and even Twitch streaming, there are still inherent biases. Earlier this year, when Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">payout data</a> was leaked, it was revealed that the highest-paid woman streamer, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokimane</a>, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-06-twitch-leak-reveals-streamer-earnings-and-lack-of-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only the 39th</a> highest paid on Twitch. Podcasting <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/podcasts-diversity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn&#8217;t known for its diversity</a> either.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify isn&#8217;t using podcast ratings for algorithmic recommendations yet, it could be part of a larger plan to make it easier to find podcasts. Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">acquired Podz</a> earlier this year to try to promote podcast discoverability.</p>
<p>In the short term, this is a clever move from Spotify to get podcasters to tell their audiences to go on Spotify, since they will need to make their show look good through ratings. This isn&#8217;t inherently a bad thing, but as Spotify and Apple compete for the greater share of the podcasting ecosystem, creators can feel like their livelihoods are caught in the middle of a larger tech race.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian edtech giant Byju’s, the nation’s most valuable startup, is in talks to go public in the U.S. by merging with a blank check company led by Churchill Capital, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Byju’s, currently valued at about $21 billion, is seeking a valuation of over $45 billion and looking to raise as much as $4 billion, the person said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in 2011 and launched its online learning platform in India in 2015, is hoping to list in the U.S. next year, and also is exploring an additional listing in its home market at a later stage, the person said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest SPAC deal to date, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">surpassing Singapore&#8217;s Grab</a>.</p>
<p>The talks haven&#8217;t been finalized yet and the terms may still change, the person cautioned. Bloomberg News first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/byju-s-is-said-in-talks-to-go-public-through-churchill-spac-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> about the talks.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in August that Byju’s had started engaging with bankers to explore listing options. Several bankers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">offered Byju’s a valuation of $40 billion to $50 billion</a> if it listed next year, the report said.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth and those of several other online learning startups, including Bangalore-headquartered Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>Byju’s, which was valued at less than $6 billion in mid-2019, has expanded to the U.S. and several international markets in recent years and made a series of acquisitions to fuel the inorganic growth. This year itself it has spent $2 billion in cash and stock to acquire 10 startups.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s says it has over 100 million registered users, about 7 million of whom pay for the courses. The startup is aiming to generate revenue of $1.3 billion in the ongoing financial year, it has said.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s unusually aggressive quest for growth has also <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/inside-india-edtech-byjus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted serious criticism</a>. The Rest of the World and many media outlets have reported that the startup&#8217;s salespeople mislead parents &#8212; many of whom can&#8217;t afford to buy the startup&#8217;s products &#8212; into getting their kids to join Byju&#8217;s subscription. The startup has previously also used intimidation tactics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/whitehat-jrs-founder-files-2-6m-defamation-suit-against-critic/">to silence its critics</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiktok-to-diversify-its-for-you-feed-let-users-pick-the-topics-they-want-to-avoid/">coming changes</a> to its For You feed, TikTok today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-editing-tools">announced</a> a handful of updates to its lineup of camera and editing tools, including new features for its popular Green Screen effect tool, as well as other updates to video enhancements and sound effects.</p>
<p>Among the updates, one highlight is the update to the Green Screen effect, which the company notes is one of the most-used effects on the platform since its 2019 <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/green-screen-effect-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a>. The tool, which allows creators to position themselves in front of a different photo or video background, will now support GIFs.</p>
<p>To make this feature work, TikTok has partnered with GIPHY &#8212; notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">a Meta-owned</a> company. With the new integration, TikTok users will be able to select from a library of GIFs to use as their background, allowing for different types of videos. For example, users could record &#8220;reaction&#8221; videos with a GIF as the background, or they could use the tool to showcase or reference a particular meme.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, as TikTok expands to include more professional creators, we&#8217;ve seen the company begin to roll out tools that better cater to that particular audience &#8212; like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/">recent test of the desktop software</a> for livestreamers. Now, the company says it will roll out an option to upload videos in 1080p HD. This feature will be available in &#8220;select countries&#8221; and will be available as a toggle (&#8220;Upload HD&#8221;) on the Publishing page under &#8220;More Options,&#8221; if available in your market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248841" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248841" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tiktok-effects-cat.png?w=680" alt="" width="453" height="980" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248841" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Another feature is a new Visual Enhancement button which will automatically improve the video&#8217;s exposure and low-light conditions and perform color correction. The idea is to offer users who aren&#8217;t necessarily video experts an easy one-tap tool that can make their content look better. To use the tool, after you record or upload a video, you&#8217;ll tap a new &#8220;Enhance&#8221; button that appears on the right-side panel. If you don&#8217;t like how the adjustments make the video look, just tap the button a second time and the effects will be removed.</p>
<p>In addition, TikTok is rolling out new musical and audio effects, including silly features that make voices or other sounds turn into either animal sounds or the sound of a musical instrument, including a flute, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suona</a> or a cat. The new features will be available on the Editing page by tapping the &#8220;Voice Effects&#8221; button on the right panel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery &#8212; where urban-dwelling consumers buy food and other essentials and can get them delivered in 15 minutes or less &#8212; continues to be a big business, and one of the juggernauts in the space is now raising a big round of funding to meet that opportunity: <a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a> is in the process of raising $1.5 billion, with a valuation of up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the funding is being structured as a &#8220;Series X&#8221; convertible note from Guggenheim Partners. Other investors are not being disclosed. The size and nature of the raise, as a convertible note, is a strong indicator that this is a round being raised ahead of a liquidity event for Philadelphia-based Gopuff, most likely an IPO that could happen as soon as mid-2022.</p>
<p>The funding process was first discovered and flagged to us by <a href="https://PrimeUnicornIndex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Unicorn Index</a> (which <a href="https://www.axios.com/gopuff-valuation-40-billion-funding-round-878cda1b-03b5-4817-aa45-4e1542446989.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> has also separately reported). The round has yet to close and the value of the raise and the valuation are the highest amount as indicated in the filing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is coming swiftly on the heels of a couple of other events for Gopuff. This summer, we broke the news that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1 billion at a $15 billion valuation</a>, and then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November</a>, the company launched officially in London on the back of two acquisitions it had made, of Dija and Fancy, with plans to expand further into Europe.</p>
<p>That European expansion has involved some attempted M&amp;A in Europe: We&#8217;ve confirmed with sources on both sides of the deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff had made an offer to acquire Flink out of Germany</a> &#8212; another instant grocery player.</p>
<p>That deal didn&#8217;t happen &#8212; not yet at least &#8212; because of differences of opinion on valuation, and a general appetite for getting acquired, according to sources. But it &#8212; and now this big funding round &#8212; both underscore Gopuff&#8217;s intentions and attentions.</p>
<p>Flink, incidentally, had also been approached by Amazon and is now being backed by DoorDash, which underscores just how much big competition Gopuff has here, but on the other hand, there are so many strong instant grocery players in Europe that there will continue to be a number of options for it and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capital may help someone take the jump into entrepreneurship, but what about the activation energy to let them think that big in the first place? To <a href="https://twitter.com/cory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cory Levy</a>, the latter has always been more important.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur behind <a href="https://www.firsttext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Text</a>, a low-friction service that connects founders to investors, launched<a href="https://www.zfellows.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Z Fellows</a> last year to test out his take. The accelerator features a one-week sabbatical program that comes with a $10,000 check in optional equity, at a $1 billion cap, to aspiring founders.</p>
<p>“The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, he explained. “Hey, don’t do that, just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: if you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul,” he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248767" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Four cohorts in, Z Fellow announced that it is scaling its vision of bringing calculated risk and activation energy to, you guessed it, the crypto world.</p>
<p>The new crypto-focused accelerator, which is now accepting applications, will still come with a traditional venture capital check, but will have tailored programming on the sector’s many rabbit holes, from regulation to the best way to utilize technology in a decentralized world. Founders and investors involved with billion-dollar crypto companies will be available for mentorship, speaker talks and daily stand ups, the founder said.</p>
<p>It’s the first of potentially many vertically focused accelerators, and Levy thinks that it comes in a makeshift moment for crypto, as billions go into space (and billions more get raised off of plans to). He’s looking for startups working on crypto infrastructure, NFTs, DAOs, DeFi protocols and gaming.</p>

<p>Given that Z Fellows doesn’t require the same amount of buy-in as a Y Combinator, quality assurance could be an issue. After all, who wouldn’t take a week of PTO, a $10,000 check and a low-stakes chance to flirt with their entrepreneurial dream? Right now, about one-third of Z Fellows come from underrepresented backgrounds, which the accelerator defines as women, people of color and/or immigrants.</p>
<p>For now, the founder is focused more on nudging people to try out an idea versus extreme vetting. Levy still interviews all fellows himself. He thinks the time-bound nature of the fellowship and mentorship is what makes Z Fellows stand out in today’s capital rich environment.</p>
<p>“While they may not need capital, I think one thing that is constant is the mentorship and the network of smart individuals,” he said. “And that applies whether you&#8217;re working in Web 2.0 or Web 3.0.”</p>

Afghan refugee Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, 31, had been [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The brother of an <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/afghan-refugee-fatally-shot-during-attempted-robbery-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber driver who was killed during an armed robbery</a> in San Francisco has published a letter to the ride-hailing giant demanding access to his brother&#8217;s Uber account, $4 million in immediate aid for the victim&#8217;s family and better pay for all Uber drivers.</p>
<p>Afghan refugee Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, 31, had been driving for both Uber and Lyft since he arrived in the United States three years ago via the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)</a> granted to Afghans who were contracted to work for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Both Yusufi and his brother Mohammad Dawood Mommand, otherwise known as Ilyas, worked alongside U.S. soldiers as interpreters for the army. Like many other Afghan refugees and immigrants, the two brothers were resettled in a low-income neighborhood in Sacramento, California, and would head into San Francisco, where incomes and fares are higher, in order to earn a living.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go to San Francisco for three to four days at a time because there&#8217;s more work, then we work and sleep in the car,&#8221; Ilyas told TechCrunch. &#8220;We try to get a room, but we cannot afford a hotel room. Because for one day, 12 hours of work, we can only make $250 or up to $300, and then if we get the room or hotel we cannot save anything for our family.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yusufi and Ilyas represent the experience of many other <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/afghan-refugees-california-high-housing-prices/620016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghan refugees in California</a>, hundreds if Ilyas is to be believed, who have to leave their own neighborhoods and cities to find enough Uber and Lyft work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the resettlement agencies tend to resettle SIV recipients in low-income areas, which are quite oftentimes far away from the city centers or places where they tend to make consistent money working for Uber, so what they end up doing is commuting a distance,&#8221; Noah Coburn, an anthropologist at Bennington College and author of &#8220;Under Contract: The Invisible Workers of America&#8217;s Global War,&#8221; told TechCrunch. Coburn has interviewed more than 250 Afghan immigrants who recently moved to the States under SIVs, and said about half of them have worked for Uber and Lyft. &#8220;I think from Sacramento to San Francisco is sort of the extreme one but I&#8217;ve heard of other ones around LA and in the San Diego area as well where they&#8217;ll often work 16 hours straight.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Yusufi and other Afghan Uber/Lyft drivers would often congregate in certain areas throughout the city where they could find free parking so they could rest, sleep or eat &#8212; usually around parks, 24 Hour Fitness gyms or Safeway supermarkets, according to Ilyas. It might have been on one of these breaks, which took place around 5 a.m. on November 28 on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Portero Avenue, that Yusufi was shot and killed. He was with a fellow Uber/Lyft driver at the time, who was also robbed of his wallet and phone. </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to the San Francisco Police Department to obtain a police record of the incident, but because the case is still active, the SFPD said it was unable to share more details other than <a href="https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/news/san-francisco-police-investigate-potrero-avenue-homicide-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what it had originally published</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch that Yusufi did not appear to be active, meaning his Uber app might not have been open, during the time of the shooting, and that he had last taken a trip the night before. Ilyas and his brother&#8217;s family said they requested access to Yusufi&#8217;s Uber account so they could learn more about his last few hours, but that Uber has still not provided access.</p>
<p>Uber said it had been in touch with the family to offer condolences and is working to provide access to the account</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the time my brother worked for Uber, not Lyft,&#8221; said Ilyas. &#8220;We have access to his Lyft, but Uber doesn&#8217;t let us open his account and get information to see how many hours he worked, when he took a break or stopped to sleep. They don&#8217;t want to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uber says he wasn&#8217;t working at the time, but how is that?&#8221; continued Ilyas. &#8220;He lives in Sacramento. When he goes to San Francisco he goes for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Determining whether or not Yusufi was working for Uber at the time is a tricky business. Uber often doesn&#8217;t consider &#8220;inactive&#8221; time, when a driver is not actively driving to a passenger or completing a ride, to be time spent on the clock. Many gig workers say this type of definition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">leads to unfair and inadequate pay</a> because it doesn&#8217;t account for the time drivers spend waiting for a customer, driving around in search of customers and just taking a break. App-based gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash say they use this model of only paying drivers for active time because it allows drivers to be flexible and use multiple apps at once.</p>
<p>It is to keep precisely this distinction that those companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year campaigning for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">Proposition 22, a ballot measure that was passed in California in November 2020</a>, which allowed app-based companies like Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>This proposition was in part a response to a 2019 worker classification bill, Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), that impacts who is entitled to coverage under California labor law. It was under AB 5 that the California courts determined Uber drivers are &#8220;employees,&#8221; which would mean they&#8217;d have access to things like paid sick leave, mandatory breaks and workers&#8217; compensation in the event of injury or accident on the job. California&#8217;s labor laws also include <a href="https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/workerscomp/benefits/death-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death benefits</a>, which include burial expenses and cash benefits to the dependents that the deceased worker supported. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Yusufi is survived by his wife, who does not speak English, and three children, including a four-month-old daughter. </span></p>
<p>Prop 22 also provides death benefits and insurance protection for injuries incurred, at the same rates as California workers&#8217; compensation, but the key distinction is that it only applies to the time an app-based driver is on the app looking for or actively engaged in performing a trip or delivery, according an Uber spokesperson.</p>
<p>In August, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/a-california-judge-just-struck-down-prop-22-now-what/">California superior court judge ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional</a>, rendering it unenforceable; however, because supporters appealed the ruling, it is stayed pending appeal. That means for the moment, at least, Prop 22 is still in effect, according to William B. Gould IV, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and author of &#8220;For Labor to Build Upon: Wars, Depression and Pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the appeal is not granted, then Yusufi&#8217;s family might have a case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without providing a legal opinion, I believe that a persuasive argument can be made that since Uber drivers are now classified as employees, Uber would be responsible for compensating for work-related injuries,&#8221; Samantha J. Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson Law, told TechCrunch. &#8220;If that part is proven, then a court would have to determine whether this tragic death is a work-related injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not it falls to Uber to recompense Yusufi&#8217;s family is up for debate. Coburn says the U.S. military should share some of that financial burden.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;If you think about the trillions that the U.S. invests in the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and in long-term health care and the GI Bill, educational support for those that went to war, which I think is a fine thing, the investment for contractors is zero,&#8221; said Coburn. &#8220;And then you had senators and Congresspeople who felt bad about that, as they should have, and so they designed the SIV program to give these Afghans a visa. But what they did was they gave them a visa and they gave them close to nothing. So there was no retraining. There was no work to find jobs. So the resettlement agencies certainly share some of the blame, but I think this is sort of a wider governmental failure to see the big picture.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Many ride-hail drivers, immigrant or not, come to the apps because they think they&#8217;ll be able to make a lot of money, but find that having to cover the costs of gas and auto repairs just ends up sucking them into working more hours to make payments, all the while they&#8217;re not building out resumes that could help them find more stable work in the future. </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Uber pledged to support <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/supporting-afghan-refugees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Afghan refugees</span></a>, yet your company pays wages so low and sustains such precarious working conditions that hundreds of Afghan drivers drive from Sacramento to San Francisco each week and sleep in their cars in unsafe environments &#8212; just to earn enough each week to provide for their families,&#8221; wrote Ilyas in his open letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, SVP and chief legal officer Tony West and SVP of marketing and public affairs Jill Hazelbaker. &#8220;My brother and I did the same. And now after all the work we did for your company, you are turning your backs on us in our time of need.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-ahmad-fawad-yusufis-family?qid=1e7cdf98d9c38e0d614da60a6ee6d80e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFundMe</a> has been set up for Yusufi&#8217;s family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe-based vertical farming firm Infarm this week<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infarm-raises-200m-to-accelerate-global-expansion-of-climate-resilient-vertical-farms-301445604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced a $200 million Series D</a>. The round, led by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/">last year’s $170 million raise.</a> It pushes the company’s total funding to north of $600 million, while placing its valuation “well” north of $1 bililion, earning its place as Europe’s first vertical farming unicorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a global farming network of our climate-resilient vertical farms is a core mission at Infarm, which is why we&#8217;re excited to announce this latest funding round,” co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska said in a release. “This strategic investment will support our rapid global expansion and bolster our R&amp;D so that we can grow more varieties of crops close to consumers across Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East. It&#8217;s another step towards meeting our ambition of growing the entire fruit and vegetable basket in the near future, providing premium products at affordable prices to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the funding will go toward Infarm’s international expansion plans, with sights set on the U.S., Canada, Japan and additional parts of Europe. The company is also set to spread into more Asia-Pacific markets and the Middle East.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>QIA’s involvement in this round is no doubt a big driver in the latter. As part of the deal, the company announcement plans for a Qatar grow center, set to grow tomatoes, strawberries and other fruits in the region. Fruits have been a big push for many vertical farming companies, as they look to move beyond the standard leafy greens and herbs that have long been their bread and butter, due to the relative ease with which they can be grown in controlled indoor settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a responsible, long-term investor, QIA&#8217;s purpose is to create value for future generations. We see vertical farming as a way to enhance food security in every part of the world,” QIA’s Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud said in the same release. “We look forward to working with Infarm to develop their first Growing Centre in Qatar, which will contribute to Qatar&#8217;s own food security and economic diversification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vertical farming certainly makes sense for the region, affording growers the ability to produce crops in climate-controlled buildings, with far less water than standard farming. In 2018, Crop One announced a 130,000-square-foot farming facility set to open in the UAE. Of course, going forward, such concerns certainly won&#8217;t be relegated to a single region.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This was a record-breaking year for private investment across digital health. Investors <a href="https://rockhealth.com/insights/q3-2021-digital-health-funding-to-20b-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured billions of dollars into digital health solutions</a> with great promise of driving innovation in a highly antiquated and inefficient industry.</p>
<p>While digital health has captivated the attention of investors and received validation from consumers, providers and healthcare stakeholders, early-stage entrepreneurs are being required to address the highly complicated yet mission-critical question: How can I show value and ROI?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The problems these companies are addressing are enormous, and the potential to help consumers and their families is even greater — key metrics that shouldn’t be overlooked.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With any new innovation, proving out a financially substantiated ROI case requires a combination of time and data, and digital health is no exception. In healthcare, proving ROI ultimately means calculating how much a digital health solution has either <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.20173633v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved in outcomes</a> or <a href="https://transcarent.ai/posts/surgical-study-savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realized in cost savings</a> for the sponsoring organization and its members.</p>
<p>While a claims-based ROI analysis is a crucial long-term measurement of success, industrywide innovation will require stakeholders across the ecosystem to initially think creatively and consider proxies for demonstrating value early on. Rather than allowing claims data to be an inhibitor of innovation, investors must reframe their focus on the long-term direction of the business, the value delivered for the end user and the broader impact of the company on the healthcare system as a whole.</p>
<p>Three key questions can help reshape measurement and investment in early-stage startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem being solved?</li>
<li>What can be measured to identify early indicators of success?</li>
<li>Why (and how) is the experience delivered so much better than the status quo?</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the problem being solved?</h2>
<p>Digital health solutions are solving some of the biggest challenges facing our society today. Take access to mental health care, for example. During the COVID-19 pandemic, about <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four in 10 adults</a> in the U.S. reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenX, an advertising tech company, will pay $2 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that the company violated federal children’s privacy law.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_1-_complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a> filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the FTC alleges that OpenX violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal information from children under 13 without obtaining parental consent.</p>
<p>The California-based company is also accused of knowingly collecting information from hundreds of apps marketed for children, toddlers and for preschool learning, before passing this data — including granular location data, IP addresses and unique device identifiers — to third parties that used the data for targeted advertising.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248773" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“OpenX has received millions, if not billions of ad requests directly or indirectly from child-directed apps, and transmitted millions, if not billions, of bid requests containing personal information of children,&#8221; the complaint read.</p>
<p>In addition to violating COPPA, the FTC&#8217;s complaint alleges that OpenX also violated the FTC Act by falsely claiming that it did not collect granular location from users who opted out of such data collection. Rather, OpenX continued to collect location data from some Android users even after they specifically chose not to have such location tracking data collected, according to the FTC.</p>
<p>“OpenX secretly collected location data and opened the door to privacy violations on a massive scale, including against children,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Digital advertising gatekeepers may operate behind the scenes, but they are not above the law.”</p>
<p>In a separate statement, FTC Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips said that the order originally stipulated a $7.5 million penalty against OpenX, but the fine was reduced to $2 million due to the company&#8217;s inability to pay. The settlement also requires the company to delete all of the ad request data it collected to serve targeted ads and to implement a comprehensive privacy program to ensure it fully complies with COPPA.</p>
<p>OpenX did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but in a <a href="https://blog.openx.com/context-around-ftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> addressing the settlement it called the data collection an “unintentional error”, adding that an internal review showed that “more than 99% of domains and apps were appropriately categorized.”</p>
<p>“We have reviewed and bolstered our policies and procedures to make sure we are fully COPPA compliant, and we will continue to follow strict criteria of both qualitative and quantitative attributes to determine a site’s or an app’s suitability for inclusion in our exchange,” the company wrote.</p>
