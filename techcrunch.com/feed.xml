										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the pandemic keeping us in one place most of the time, proptech is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">taking off</a>. And not just in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dongnae.com/">Dongnae</a> is looking to digitize the rental and home buying market in South Korea. The startup is announcing the close of a $4.1 million seed round, led by Flybridge and MetaProp, with participation by Goodwater Capital, Maple VC, and a variety of strategic angel investors in both Korea and the U.S. This brings Dongnae&#8217;s total funding to $4.8 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Matthew Shampine, who was born in Korea but raised in New Jersey. Running WeWork Labs, Shampine was stationed in Asia and then more specifically Korea to build out that arm of the massive coworking firm. Moving a lot, Shampine realized the massive hole in the very fragmented real estate market in Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dongnae is very similar to Redfin in the U.S., giving buyers and renters a centralized place to find their new home. For now, the startup only represents the buyer/renter side, partnering with the thousands of brokers in Korea to essentially build out the country&#8217;s first true MLS (multiple listing system).</p>
<p>Some important context: the real estate market in Korea is very different than here in the states. First, most buildings have their own broker with retail space on the ground floor, meaning that there are thousands of brokers in Korea who only represent a limited number of properties. In fact, Shampine says there are about the same number of brokers in Korea as in the U.S., which has has a much bigger population.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the fragmentation across brokers, there is no real MLS in Korea that unifies all available properties. Renters and buyers must work across dozens of brokers and usually have to go see the space in person, rather than browse photos online. This system also means that the brokers are often representing both the buyer/renter and seller, which means they aren&#8217;t always negotiating in the best interest of the buyer.</p>
<p>Dongnae partners with brokers to centralize all the listings into one place, and gives buyers and renters an interface to browse those homes. In fact, Dongnae offers a Tinder-like experience for buyers, letting them swipe left and right on homes to learn more and more about what they&#8217;re looking for and ultimately serve up the best fit.</p>
<p>Not unlike Airbnb, Dongnae goes from complex to complex and builds out the digital inventory for each listing, taking 4K photos and watermarking them and passing them back to the broker, while also listing them on Dongnae.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily a franchise but it&#8217;s a really close partnership,&#8221; said Shampine.</p>
<p>Dongnae makes money by taking a buyer side fee, just like any other broker, which is around 8 percent in Korea. The team is 25 people strong and gender diversity at Dongnae is about 50/50.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup Skyroot is closing out 2020 with a key milestone in the development program for their Vikram-I launch vehicle: A successful test firing of a solid rocket propulsion stage that serves as a demonstrator of the same tech to be used in the production Vikram. This is the first time that a private Indian company has designed, built and tested a solid rocket propulsion stage in its entirety, and follows a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/indias-first-private-space-launch-startup-skyroot-succeeds-with-upper-stage-engine-fire-test/"> successful engine burn test of an upper stage prototype earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Skyroot also created its solid rocket stage using a carbon composite structure whose manufacturing process is entirely automated, the company says. That allows it to realize weight savings of up to five times vs. use of steel, a material typically used to house solid rocket propellant stages. The goal is to use the same process in the production of the final version of Vikram-I, which will help the small launch vehicle realize big benefits in terms of cost, in addition to the reliability benefits that come with the relatively uncomplicated fundamental design of solid rockets, which have no moving parts and therefore less opportunity for failure.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VF6DgH1jxK4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final third-stage Vikram-1 engine will be 4x the size of this demonstrator, and Skyroot is also in the process of manufacturing four other test solid rocket motors which have a carrying range of thrust, and which will be tested throughout the course of next years as work finishes on their construction.</p>
<p>Skyroot aims to perform its first Vikram-I launch by next December, supported in part by the Indian Space Research Organization. The company has raised $4.3 million to date, and says it&#8217;s currently in the process of raising another $15 million round which it&#8217;ll aim to close next year. It&#8217;s set to become the first private Indian company to build and operate private launch vehicles, with the regulatory framework now in place to allow that to happen since India opened up private launcher operations earlier this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Early in the pandemic, it was apparent that there would be worldwide lockdowns of varying degrees. So naturally, there was a run on toilet paper (and to a lesser extent, paper towels and tissues). Stores suddenly found themselves sold out of one of the most basic conveniences consumed by humans.</p>
<p>We had never seen this level of preparation, and the supply chains were not ready. They were still moving at the speed of business-as-usual, creating a gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Sliding further into the pandemic, this supply issue for basic goods shifted to the front-line workers who were stretching the safe limits of their personal protective equipment (PPE). This exposed the effect of a sudden change of demand in supply chains. Companies began to repurpose their production to produce protection equipment and hand sanitizer. Some to make a quick profit, others to fill a need in the supply chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It is time for companies and entire industries to rethink and transform their global supply chain models — in close collaboration with governments.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Governments and corporations were scrambling. There were spreadsheets floating around with offers from potential suppliers.</p>
<p>During this period, it was difficult to get an overview of the entire market, as quality, vendor search and price fluctuations caused general chaos. It was near impossible to track the origin of production, receive any information about any data related to the quality controls of production facilities. The market was flooded with bad products, fakes and so on. Think pieces started to appear with a beginner&#8217;s guide to supply chain structure.</p>
<p>Consumers began to understand that the system as it stood was not built for this type of upheaval.</p>
<h2>Corporate sourcing strategies have been challenged</h2>
<p>We have clearly witnessed that companies have little control of the supply chains. Normally most companies only have a moderately competent risk plan for tier one suppliers. We can only assume that this is why most of us are going without an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 this holiday season. These are not products that are built with components from one source; there are multiple components and materials that go into creating one of these machines.</p>
<p>From the refining process of the outer materials, to the dyeing colors, plastic elements and the need to have low-cost production sites in low-cost countries, all contribute to possible delays in production when things are not moving as they should be. De-constructing a gaming console reveals an extremely complicated matrix of companies, processes, materials and countries.</p>
<p>If we had direct visibility into the journey of each component in a gaming console as a sort of smart-representation exposing all the materials, people involved, companies and locations, we would be able to pinpoint inefficiencies in the supply chain.</p>
<p>All these materials and components find their way in the supply chain, but their stories get lost along the way. That specific data is not available, and thus both companies and countries are struggling to create effective risk plans for world events that throw the supply chain into chaos. Currently, there is a revolution happening under the radar of most people, enabled by distributed ledger technologies (blockchain) to bring such transparency into the supply chains.</p>
<h2>Identify your vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Understanding where the risks lie so that companies can protect themselves may require a lot of digging. It entails going far beyond the first and second tiers and mapping full supply chains, including distribution facilities and transportation hubs. This is time-consuming and expensive, which explains why most major firms have focused their attention only on strategic direct suppliers that account for large amounts of their expenditures.</p>
<p>But a surprise disruption that brings a business to a halt can be much more costly than a deep look into a supply chain.</p>
<p>The goal of the mapping process should be to categorize suppliers as low, medium, or high risk and build appropriate mitigation strategies. But this approach is only possible if we can access the data generated by different suppliers at any tier in the supply chain — and we can trust this data for analysis.</p>
<p>The aim is to have early warnings of delays or disruptions, allowing for either the diversification of sources or the stockpiling of key materials or items. Of course, that is all speculative as we have a vaccine rolling out, only months after running out of toilet paper.</p>
<h2>Pandemic and the vaccine and supply chains</h2>
<p>What we thought was a global and free market was challenged this year. Medical companies experienced a lack of capability to source some core ingredients, such as active ingredients in headache pills produced in India. Everything became a national fight to secure needed goods for one&#8217;s own country — a trend also enhanced by the increased nationalism and protectionism in trade. The need for control and visibility into supply chains was apparent and also became a priority for governments and not only the private sector.</p>
<p>With the rollout of a vaccine (or several vaccines), we not only will see the issues presented above in the sense of risk, control of sourcing and process, but quality and responsibility as well. From fakes to already active cyberattacks targeting a<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-vaccines-cyber/ibm-warns-hackers-targeting-covid-vaccine-cold-chain-supply-process-idUSL1N2II05A"> very specific point</a> of the supply chain process (vaccines must be shipped and held at a certain temperature) we’re seeing the need for decentralized logistic systems that tell the story of every touch point in production. But none of this will matter if governments cannot manage their own supply chain needs,<a href="https://t.co/tIG1k4usTF"> as we’re already seeing</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible that lessons will be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time for companies and entire industries to rethink and transform their global supply chain models — in close collaboration with governments. One thing is for sure, the pandemic has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many organizations, especially those who have a solid dependence on global sourcing for raw or finished materials.</p>
<p>The good news is that new supply chain technologies are emerging that will heighten visibility across supply chains, reducing risk and creating an infrastructure that can handle the volatility of the next pandemic. The application of distributed ledger technology has already proven to be useful as a solution to ensure accountability and trust in the data provided along the supply chain. Digital supply networks will slowly replace linear supply chain models, breaking down functional silos to create end-to-end visibility, collaboration, agility and optimization.</p>
<p>That is good news for the future, especially since we’re all experts in supply chain logistics after nearly a year of working from home, stockpiling toilet paper and clicking refresh to hopefully add one of the not-nearly-enough gaming consoles to our cart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rendin.co/">Rendin</a>, an Estonian proptech startup that wants to improve the home rental experience, including offering a no-deposit feature, has raised €1.2 million in seed funding. Backing the round is Tera Ventures, Iron Wolf Capital, Truesight Ventures, Atomico&#8217;s Angel Programme, and Startup Wise Guys.</p>
<p>Launched in Estonia in March this year and currently expanding to Poland, Rendin operates a long-term rental platform that promises to smooth out the process between landlords and tenants. Its headline feature is an insurance-backed solution that means no deposit is required from tenants.</p>
<p>The broader premise is that by digitising the rental process and adding an insurance layer, further trust can be generated between parties, therefore increasing occupancy rates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For landlords, Rendin has created a &#8220;letting agreement service&#8221; with certain guarantees and has insured those risks via a partnership with ERGO Insurance SE (Munich Re Group). So, for example, if a tenant causes damage or ends up in debt, the property owner is covered. The letting agreement is handled via the startup&#8217;s app and platform that plugs into rental marketplaces and real estate CRMs on the backend to provide a fully digital experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched publicly in Estonia on March 10th, 2020, two days before the country went into pandemic lockdown,&#8221; Rendin co-founder Alain Aun tells me. &#8220;It really looked like the world was going to fall apart and a lot of the risks in home renting skyrocketed. We had to reinvent some parts of our product insurance very quickly to adjust to the changes around us.</p>
<p>“Suddenly we had desperate tenants losing their income, expats leaving the country in a hurry, and more. Our learning curve was tremendous. We figured, if we can survive this, we can survive anything. The last eleven months have been constant proof to us that the concept of Rendin can endure”.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Passion Capital has backed Fronted, the startup that wants to offer loans to cover rent deposits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/embed/#?secret=nhCz8mczKr" data-secret="nhCz8mczKr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Longer term, Rendin is building what Aun describes as “a new standard in home renting”. The first step is to manage the rental process risks to help establish trust between landlords and tenants. This has seen the proptech startup build an “end-to-end value chain,” from contracting, evidence-based handover, preventive insurance flows, loss control, and claim handling.</p>
<p>Aun says Rendin’s insurance product offers landlords more safety than regular deposits, while some risks for tenants are also covered. “The insurance is a tool that helps Rendin to solve real-life, often complicated situations in renting, both for landlords and tenants,” he explains. “Tenants in the Rendin platform don’t have to pay the security deposit, but this is just a feature, not the core product. Trust is the name of the game”.</p>
<p>To generate revenue and cover the insurance costs, Rendin charges a fee of 2.5 percent of the monthly rent. It can be paid by the tenant or by the landlord. “More and more landlords choose to pay the Rendin fee themselves as it helps find new tenants faster,” adds Aun.</p>
<p>On the competition, Rendin isn’t competing with real estate listing sites or letting agencies, and instead can be thought of more as a plugin that can be easily integrated into listing sites and agents’ business processes.</p>
<p>“There are a few no-deposit startups around but their business models, although similar at first glance, are entirely different from ours,” claims the Rendin co-founder. “Most of them are set up to be essentially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/">lending businesses</a> that collect interest from tenants with real estate agencies serving up demand for them, but they don’t really do anything to help mitigate risks for the parties [involved]”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Applications based on artificial intelligence &#8212; whether they are systems running autonomous services, platforms being used in drug development or to predict the spread of a virus, traffic management for 5G networks, or something else altogether &#8212; require an unprecedented amount of computing power to run. And today, one of the big names in the world of designing and building processors fit for the task has closed a major round of funding as it takes its business to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphcore</a>, the Bristol, UK-based AI chipmaker, has raised $222 million, a Series E that CEO and co-founder Nigel Toon said in an interview will be used for a couple of key purposes.</p>
<p>First, Graphcore will use the money to continue expanding its technology, based around an architecture it calls &#8220;IPU&#8221; (Intelligence Processing Unit), which competes against chips from the likes of Nvidia and Intel also optimized for AI applications. And second, Graphcore will use the funding to shore up its finances ahead of a possible public listing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The funding, Toon said, gives Graphcore $440 million in cash on the balance sheet and a post-money, $2.77 billion valuation to start 2021.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We’re in a strong position to double down and grow fast and take advantage of the opportunity in front of us,&#8221; he added. He said it could be &#8220;premature&#8221; to describe this Series E as a &#8220;pre-IPO&#8221; round, &#8220;we have enough cash and this puts us in a position to take that next step,&#8221; he added. The company has in recent weeks been rumored to be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/12/06/blow-uk-tech-ambitions-graphcore-mulls-nasdaq-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eyeing up a listing not in the UK but on Nasdaq in the US</a>.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding is coming from a roster of financial investors. Led by the Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan, it also includes participation from Fidelity International and Schroders, as well as previous investors Baillie Gifford and Draper Esprit. Graphcore has now raised some $710 million to date.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This Series E gives Graphcore a definite step up in its valuation &#8212; the company last raised money back in February of this year, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/graphcore-the-ai-chipmaker-raises-another-150m-at-a-1-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 million extension to its Series D</a> that valued the company at $1.95 billion &#8212; but all the same, it closes off what Toon described as a &#8220;challenging&#8221; year for the company (and indeed, the world at large). </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I view this year as a speed bump,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has been challenging and we&#8217;ve realigned to speed things up.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">As it has been for many companies, the year came in different parts.</p>
<p class="p1">On one side, Graphcore&#8217;s hardware and software product development continued apace with ever-faster processors in ever-smaller packages. In July, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/graphcore-second-generation-chip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphcore launched</a> the second generation of its flagship chip, the GC200, and a new IPU Machine that runs on it, the M2000, which the company described at the time as the first AI computer to achieve a petaflop of processing power “in the size of a pizza box.”</p>
<p class="p1">But on the other side, the building and launch of those products was largely done with a remote workforce, with employees sent to work from home to help slow down the spread of the coronavirus that has gripped the world and rewritten how much of it operates.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, the industry at large, and how companies are spending and investing during a period of uncertainty, has also likely shifted. Some companies like Amazon, Apple and Google are all getting more serious about their own chipmaking efforts. Others are caught up in a wave of consolidation: witness<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nvidia&#8217;s efforts to acquire ARM in a $40 billion deal.  </span></p>
<p class="p1">All of these spell challenges for an upstart like Graphcore. Toon said Graphcore doesn&#8217;t have any plans to make acquisitions: its strategy is based around organic growth.</p>
<p class="p1">And, no great surprises here, he is not excited about Nvidia&#8217;s acquisition of ARM: &#8220;If we’re not careful, things will consolidate too much and that could kill off innovation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have made our position clear to the UK government. We don’t think the Nvidia ARM deal is a good thing.&#8221; (Somewhat ironic, considering he and Graphcore co-founder Simon Knowles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/09/nvidia-buys-baseband-and-rf-technology-company-icera-for-367m-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> a previous startup to none other than Nvidia.)</p>
<p class="p1">He also declined to talk about new customers for Graphcore, but he said that there has been interest from financial services companies, and some from the world of healthcare, automotive and internet companies, &#8220;large hyperscalers&#8221; in his words, that require the kind of technology that Graphcore is building either to run their systems, or to complement processors that they are potentially also building themselves. (Strategic backers of the company include the likes of Microsoft, BMW, Bosch and Dell.)</p>
<p class="p1">Graphcore said that the company is shipping its newest products &#8220;in production volume&#8221; to customers, and Toon said that a couple of big names are likely to be announced in the coming year, one that some believe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might actually be calmer overall for the chip industry compared to 2020</a>.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s that pull of technology, and specifically the processing demands of the next generation of computing, that investors believe will continue to drive business to Graphcore as the dust settles on this year.</p>
<p>“The market for purpose-built AI processors is expected to be significant in the coming years because of computing megatrends like cloud technology and 5G and increased AI adoption, and we believe Graphcore is poised to be a leader in this space,” said Olivia Steedman, senior managing director, Teachers’ Innovation Platform (TIP) at Ontario Teachers’. “TIP focuses on investing in tech-enabled businesses like Graphcore that are at the forefront of innovation in their sector. We are excited to partner with Nigel and the strong management team to support the company’s continued growth and product development.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://portal.dxy.cn/">DXY</a>, a 20-year-old online healthcare community for Chinese consumers and healthcare organizations like Pfizer, announced this week that it has raised $500 million in its Series E round led by private equity firm Trustbridge Partners.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/chinese-internet-giant-tencent-invests-70-million-in-healthcare-group-dxy/">Existing backer Tencent</a> and Hillhouse Capital&#8217;s<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200607005037/en/GL-Ventures-Completes-24-Million-Series-B-2-Investment-in-Clover-Biopharmaceuticals"> early-stage focused GL Ventures</a> also participated in the round, which lifted the firm&#8217;s total funding to over $680 million to date. DXY&#8217;s earlier investors include Xiaomi founder Lei Jun&#8217;s Shunwei Capital, Legend Capital and DCM.</p>
<p>The company started out as a knowledge-sharing platform for doctors and has over time added a consumer-facing aspect by bringing wellness advice and medical consultation services to the public, that is, steps that patients can take at home before having to go to the hospital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the pandemic took hold, hospitals and people around the world rushed to shift their activities online, spurring demand for healthcare apps. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dxy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dxy">DXY <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> responded swiftly and was among the first in China to introduce a real-time COVID-19 tracker at the beginning of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Today, healthcare organizations can also use DXY as an advertising channel, a learning platform as well as a recruiting site, ways for the company to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the site has attracted some 130 million consumers, more than 9,000 medical institutions, and 50,000 doctors who have provided online consultation. The platform has a current user base of 20 million and counts Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca among its major clients.</p>
<p>DXY plans to spend its new proceeds on buttressing the two pillars of its business &#8212; support for healthcare professionals and services for consumers. It will do so by strengthening cooperation with hospitals, consumer goods enterprises and pharmaceutical companies, including jointly funding R&amp;D in products or new consumer applications.</p>
<p>On the consumer front, the company faces some strong opponents in China including the likes of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-pingan-indonesia/coronavirus-spurs-ping-an-good-doctor-to-hire-hundreds-of-doctors-in-indonesia-idUSL4N2BH1TQ">SoftBank-backed Ping An Good Doctor</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/china-digital-healthcare/">Alibaba Health</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/china-digital-healthcare/">JD Health</a>, and WeDoctor, which is also backed by Tencent.</p>

<p>Less than two months ago, Chinese authorities halted the planned IPO of Ant Group, the payments and fintech company that spun out of Alibaba nearly a decade earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now the government has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/"> laid out a plan</a> for how Ant Group can become compliant and presumably go public, with steps including a renewed focus on payments, obtaining necessary licenses for its credit business, establishing a financial holding company, revamping several of its other business lines (credit, insurance, wealth management) and increasing compliance for its securities business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">also investigating Alibaba</a> over antitrust concerns. The crackdown is prompting global investors to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/global-investors-flee-from-chinese-tech-stocks-after-the-government-crackdown-on-ant-and-alibaba/">unload their Chinese tech stocks</a>.</p>

<p>Hayabusa 2 was launched in 2014 and arrived at the asteroid named Ryugu in 2018, at which point it deployed a couple landers to test surface conditions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/hayabusa2-lands-on-an-asteroid-and-sends-back-amazing-pictures-to-prove-it/">It touched down itself in the next year</a>, blasting the surface with a space gun so that it could collect not just the surface gravel but what might lie beneath it. After a long trip home it reentered the atmosphere on December 5 and was collected in the Australian desert.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Although everything worked perfectly, the team could never really be sure they would truly get the samples they hoped for until they opened the sample collection containers in a sealed room back at headquarters. The materials inside have been teased in a few tweets, but today JAXA <a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201225_samples/">posted all of the public images</a> along with some new explanations and discoveries.</p>
<p>For one thing, the &#8220;sample catcher&#8221; itself had grains of sediment from Ryugu. Perhaps this material, exposed to different conditions than that of the containers, will prove different when analyzed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091102" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091102" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png" alt="" width="603" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png?resize=300,253 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hayabusa-object.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2091102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JAXA</p></div></p>
<p>For another, sample container C appears to have an &#8220;artificial object&#8221; in it! But don&#8217;t get excited — as the team writes on their blog, &#8220;the origin is under investigation, but a probable source is aluminium scraped off the spacecraft sampler horn as the projectile was fired to stir up material during touchdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s probably a bit of the probe that came off during the not-so-gentle process of shooting the asteroid and crashing into it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1854798" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hayabusa_ryugu-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1854798" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1854798" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hayabusa_ryugu-1.gif" alt="GIF of the Hayabusa probe crashing into the asteroid Ryugu." width="700" height="490" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1854798" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JAXA</p></div></p>
<p>But the most important bit is all the rocks collected as planned. As you can see by the scale bar, these are little more than pebbles, but they&#8217;re large enough to show evidence of all kinds of processes leading to their particular shape and makeup. There&#8217;s also plenty of smaller-scale dirt and dust from below the surface that scientists hope could show signs of organic materials and water, the building blocks of life as we know it.</p>
<p>The success of the mission is worth celebrating, and the team has only just begun studying the materials brought back from Ryugu — so we can expect more information soon as they perform the painstaking work of analysis on these priceless samples. The <a href="https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa">Hayabusa 2 Twitter account</a> is probably the best way to stay up to date day to day.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Qualtrics, a software company that helps companies poll their employee base, customers and others, filed to go public. It&#8217;s the second time that the Utah-based unicorn has done so, failing the first time to complete its offering after SAP swooped in and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">bought it for around $8 billion in cash</a>.</p>

<p>SAP announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">late July of this year</a> that Qualtrics would be spun out via an IPO, bringing the smaller company&#8217;s saga full-circle.</p>

First, Qualtrics is larger than it was, and older. And its financials are more complex as it extricates itself from its soon-to-be-erstwhile corporate parent.</p>
<p>Qualtrics intends to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;XM.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking back at <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/qualtrics-and-sap-fired-up-after-their-8b-tie-up-announced-over-weekend/">my chat</a> with Ryan Smith, then Qualtrics CEO and today its chairman, and Bill McDermott, then SAP&#8217;s CEO and today the CEO of ServiceNow, it&#8217;s hard to believe that the acquisition deal was only two years ago.</p>
<p>Much has changed since late 2018. Let&#8217;s see what happened to Qualtrics in the meantime. We&#8217;ll dig into the financials, the company&#8217;s implied valuation range (spoiler: It has gone up) and whatever else we can shake loose.</p>
<h2>The new Qualtrics S-1</h2>
<p>A few things up top. First, SAP will be the company&#8217;s controlling shareholder after the Qualtrics&#8217; IPO. That&#8217;s early in the S-1 filing. And, Smith and Silver Lake are investing in the company as part of its new debut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FAA today announced that it will be issuing <a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541">two new rules</a> for drone pilots in the U.S. The first is the implementation of a long-awaited Remote ID. The system effectively works as a kind of digital license plate for unmanned aircraft, broadcasting identifying details, including the location of the craft.</p>
<p>The full text of the finalized new rule can<a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"> be found here</a>. In short, drone operators will have one of three methods for complying:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Operate a standard Remote ID drone that broadcasts identification and location information of the drone and control station;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>2. Operate a drone with a Remote ID broadcast module (may be a separate device attached to the drone), which broadcasts identification, location, and take-off information; or</p>
<p>3. Operate a drone without Remote ID but at specific FAA-recognized identification areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>While some drone operators are likely to be put off by additional regulations, their arrival is understandable given the sheer volume and speed of drone adoption. The FAA says that more than 1.7 million drones have been registered in the U.S., along with around 203,000 certifications for drone pilots. Those numbers will likely only snowball as more drones are deployed for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Notably, the FAA sees the new rules as a method for accelerating drone deliveries in the U.S. “The new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a release tied to the news. “They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.”</p>
<p>Also new is the “Operations Over People and at Night” rule, which, as the name implies, regulates both the ability to fly over people and fly at night. The rule features a number of different qualifications for compliance, including weighing less than 0.55 pounds to fly overhead.</p>
<p>According to the rule, “small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 25 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects.”</p>
<p>In order to fly at night, drones need to sport operational anti-collision lights that can been see for three miles. The rules are set to be officially published next month, officially becoming effective 60 days later. Drone makers will have a year-and-a-half to begin adding Remote ID to their devices. In August, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/amazons-prime-air-drone-delivery-fleet-gains-faa-approval-for-trial-commercial-flights/">FAA granted Amazon permission</a> for delivery trials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pokémon GO was created to encourage players to explore the world while coordinating impromptu large group gatherings — activities we&#8217;ve all been encouraged to avoid since the pandemic began.</span></p>
<p>And yet, analysts estimate that 2020 was <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020">Pokémon GO&#8217;s highest-earning year yet</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			By twisting some knobs and tweaking variables, Pokémon GO became much easier to play without leaving the house.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> approach to 2020 was full of carefully considered changes, and I&#8217;ve highlighted many of their key decisions below.</p>
<p>Consider this something of an addendum to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">the Niantic EC-1</a> I wrote last year, where I outlined things like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/how-a-google-side-project-evolved-into-a-4b-company/">beginnings as a side project within Google</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/pokemon-go-and-the-april-fools-joke-that-made-billions/">Pokémon Go began as an April Fools&#8217; joke</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/harry-potter-the-platform-and-the-future-of-niantic/">the company&#8217;s aim to build the platform that powers the AR headsets of the future</a>.</p>
<h2>Hit the brakes</h2>
<p>On a press call outlining an update <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shipped in November, the company put it on no uncertain terms: the roadmap they&#8217;d followed over the last ten-or-so months was <em>not</em> the one they started the year with. Their original roadmap included a handful of new features that have yet to see the light of day. They declined to say what those features <em>were</em> of course (presumably because they still hope to launch them once the world is less broken) — but they just didn&#8217;t make sense to release right now.</p>
<p>Instead, as any potential end date for the pandemic slipped further into the horizon, the team refocused in Q1 2020 on figuring out ways to adapt what already worked and adjust existing gameplay to let players do more while going out less.</p>
<h2>Turning the dials</h2>
<p>As its name indicates, GO was never meant to be played while sitting at home. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/john-hanke" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="john-hanke">John Hanke&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> initial vision for Niantic was focused around finding ways to get people outside and playing together; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/how-a-google-side-project-evolved-into-a-4b-company/">its very first prototype</a>, Niantic had players running around a city to take over its virtual equivalent block by block. They&#8217;d spent nearly a decade building up a database of real-world locations that would act as in-game points meant to encourage exploration and wandering. Years of development effort went into turning Pokémon GO into more and more of a social game, requiring teamwork and sometimes even flash mob-like meetups for its biggest challenges.</p>
<p>Now it all needed to work from the player&#8217;s couch.</p>
<p>The earliest changes were those that were easiest for Niantic to make on-the-fly, but they had dramatic impacts on the way the game actually works.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doubling the players &#8220;radius&#8221; for interacting with in-game gyms, landmarks that players can temporarily take over for their in-game team, earning occupants a bit of in-game currency based on how long they maintain control. This change let more gym battles happen from the couch.</li>
<li>Increasing spawn points, generally upping the number of Pokémon you could find at home dramatically.</li>
<li>Increasing &#8220;incense&#8221; effectiveness, which allowed players to use a premium item to encourage even <em>more</em> Pokémon to pop up at home. Niantic phased this change out in October, then quietly reintroduced it in late November. Incense would also last twice as long, making it cheaper for players to use.</li>
<li>Allowing steps taken indoors (read: on treadmills) to count toward in-game distance challenges.</li>
<li>Players would no longer need to walk long distances to earn entry into the online player-versus-player battle system.</li>
<li>Your &#8220;buddy&#8221; Pokémon (a specially designated Pokémon that you can level up Tamagotchi-style for bonus perks) would now bring you more gifts of items you&#8217;d need to play. Pre-pandemic, getting these items meant wandering to the nearby &#8220;Pokéstop&#8221; landmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By twisting some knobs and tweaking variables, Pokémon GO became much easier to play without leaving the house — but, importantly, these changes avoided anything that might break the game while being just as easy to reverse once it became safe to do so.</p>
<h2>GO Fest goes virtual</h2>

<p>Thrown by Niantic every year since 2017, GO Fest is meant to be an ultra-concentrated version of the Pokémon GO experience. Thousands of players cram into one park, coming together to tackle challenges and capture previously unreleased Pokémon.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For obvious reasons, many of us are spending the final week of 2020 looking forward. Samsung is hoping some folks are looking far enough ahead to reserve a spot in line for its still-unannounced Galaxy S21 handset (not an official name, mind, but probably a safe guess).</p>
<p>If you’re on the Samsung Mobile mailing list, you may well have received an email, compelling you to <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/">“Get ready to jump to the next Galaxy.”</a> The link takes you to a reservation page that offers up some perks for getting in early on the company’s new flagship, including credits on other Samsung products like Galaxy earbuds.</p>
<p>The company recently noted that it would have more information in January — be it at CES or, more likely, a standalone event. That bucks trends a bit, which have found the company introducing its latest Galaxy S devices closer to Mobile World Congress (the S20 &#8212; pictured above &#8212; was announced February 11). Of course, MWC has been delayed until late June next year and nothing is really normal besides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/not-even-5g-could-rescue-smartphone-sales-in-2020/">noted in a recent piece</a>, 2020 was the roughest in a series of rough years for the smartphone industry, so why not get those pre-orders started a little early? And hey, not everyone got what they wanted for the holiday. Why not treat yourself to a new phone?</p>

<p>The good news is we know a lot about the unannounced phone. Samsung’s never been great at keeping things under wraps and we’re already starting to see some key details leaking out a few weeks ahead of the expected official unveil. Surprisingly, camera specs look to more or less be in line with the last model, after the company promised some big imaging strides in 2021. Perhaps those updates will arrive more in the form of software, instead of straight hardware bumps.</p>
<p><a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html">Specs from Winfuture</a> point to — naturally — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/qualcomms-snapdragon-888-will-land-on-phones-in-q1-2021/">the Snapdragon 888</a> in the U.S., with the Exynos 2100 chip in other locales. The S21 sports a 6.2-inch display and 4000 mAh battery, where as the Plus upgrades things to 6.7 inches and 4,800 mAh, per the leak.</p>
<p>Samsung is expected to make everything official on January 14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen Group has developed a mobile electric vehicle charger that can autonomously navigate parking areas, power up an EV and then make its way back to its outpost without the intervention of humans.</p>
<p>The prototype, which VW Group Components created, aims to showcase how the automaker will expand charging infrastructure over the next few years to meet the expected demand that will arise as it produces and sells more electric vehicles. VW Group has committed to launching dozens of electric models over the next decade. The group&#8217;s Volkswagen brand plans to build and sell 1.5 million electric cars by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;Setting up an efficient charging infrastructure for the future is a central task that challenges the entire sector,&#8221; Volkswagen Group Components CEO Thomas Schmall said in a statement. &#8220;We are developing solutions to help avoid costly stand-alone measures. The mobile charging robot and our flexible quick-charging station are just two of these solutions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VW Group is developing a portfolio of different DC charging products, including a DC wallbox that charges up to 22 kilowatts. The automaker began piloting its DC wallbox earlier this month at some of its production sites in Germany. VW Group is also planning to launch a flexible — yet still more stationary — quick-charging station in early 2021.</p>
<p>The mobile charging robot doesn&#8217;t have a release date. The company said now that it has reached prototype status it will be &#8220;comprehensively further developed.&#8221; There is one caveat for the mobile charger. VW said that car-to-X communication, which allows a vehicle to &#8220;talk&#8221; to infrastructure, will be one prerequisite for the mobile charger to reach market maturity.</p>
<p>The charging robot prototype can be started via an app launched by the vehicle owner or car-to-x communication. Once the communication begins, the mobile charger turns on — two digital eyes open on the display — and it steers toward a vehicle. The mobile charger opens the charging socket flap as well as connects or disconnects the plug. The mobile charger is also able to move and then connect the vehicle to an energy storage unit. Once the charging is complete, the robot collects the mobile energy storage unit and takes it back to a central charging station.</p>
<p>Schmall said the DC charging products will not just focus on customers&#8217; needs and the technical prerequisites of electric vehicles, but will also consider the economical possibilities of possible partners such as operators of parking bays and underground car parks.</p>
<p>You can watch the video of the mobile charging robot in action below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global investors are running from Chinese tech stocks in the wake of the government&#8217;s crackdown on Ant Group and Alibaba, two high-flying businesses founded by Ma Yun (Jack Ma) that were once hailed as paragons of China&#8217;s new tech elite.</p>
<p>Shares of major technology companies in the country have fallen sharply in recent days, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/alibaba-hikes-share-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-from-6-billion?sref=gni836kR">with Bloomberg calculating</a> that Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com and Meituan have lost around $200 billion in value during a handful of trading sessions.</p>
<p>Already reeling from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">last-minute halt</a> of the public debut of Ant Group, a major Chinese fintech player with deep ties to Alibaba, the e-commerce giant came under new fire, as China&#8217;s markets watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">opened a probe</a> into its business practices concerning potentially anticompetitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ant Group was itself summoned by the government on December 26, leading to a plan that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">will force the company to &#8220;rectify&#8221; its business practices</a>.</p>
<p>Shares of Alibaba are off around 30% from their recent record highs set in late October. Tech shares are also off in the country more broadly, with one <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CQQQ/">Chinese-technology-focused ETC</a> falling around 8% from recent highs, including a 1.5% drop today.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China postpones Ant&#8217;s colossal IPO after closed-door talk with Jack Ma&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/embed/#?secret=SHBfpDBPjn" data-secret="SHBfpDBPjn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The American Depositary Receipts used by traders to invest in Alibaba fell from around $256 per share at the close of Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange to around $222 last Thursday. The company is down another half point today. It was worth more than $319 per share earlier in the quarter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the rising tensions between China&#8217;s tech giants and the country&#8217;s ruling Communist Party have investors spooked. But Jack Ma&#8217;s relationship with the Chinese government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556">has always been a bit more fraught</a> than that of his peers. Ma Huateng (Pony Ma), the founder of Tencent, and Xu Yong (Eric Yong) and Li Yanhong (Robin Li), the co-founders of Baidu, have kept lower profiles than the Alibaba founder.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/dissecting-china-s-crackdown-on-its-internet-giants-quicktake?sref=AwwRcx4b">has a good synopsis of the state of the market right now</a>. The companies that are most directly in the crosshairs appear to be Ma Yun&#8217;s, but at different times, Tencent has been the focus of Chinese regulators bent on curbing the company&#8217;s influence through gaming.</p>
<p>Specifically for Alibaba things have gone from bad to worse, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/alibaba-hikes-share-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-from-6-billion?sref=gni836kR">boosted share buyback program</a> was not enough to halt the bleeding.</p>

<p>Whether this new round of regulations is a solitary blip on the radar or the signal of an increasing interest in Beijing tying tech companies closer to national interests remains to be seen. As the tit-for-tat tech conflict between the U.S. and China continues, many companies that had seen their growth as apolitical may become caught in the diplomatic crossfire.</p>
<p>Other tech companies are seeing their fortunes rise, boosted by newfound interest from the central government in Beijing.</p>
<p>This is already apparent in the chip industry, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/technology/china-semiconductors.html">China&#8217;s push for self-reliance has brought new riches and capital for new businesses</a>. It&#8217;s true for Liu FengFeng, whose company, Tsinghon, was able to raise $5 million for its attempt at building a new semiconductor manufacturer in the country. Intellifusion, a manufacturer of chipsets focused on machine learning applications, <a href="https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2020/04/03/chinese-ai-chip-maker-intellifusion-completes-141m-pre-ipo-round">was able to raise another $141 million back in April</a>.</p>
<p>Private investors may be less enthused at the prospect of backing Chinese tech upstarts who could face government censure should the regulatory winds shift. Whether other startup markets in the region &#8212; India, Japan, among others &#8212; will benefit from the Chinese regulatory barrage will be interesting to track in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government is appealing the ruling that blocked the Trump administration&#8217;s TikTok ban, according to a new court filing. On December 7, 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols in Washington <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/">became the second U.S. judge to block</a> the Commerce Department&#8217;s attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">stop the TikTok app</a> from being downloaded from U.S. app stores, citing threats to national security.</p>
<p>The Trump administration had raised concerns over the videosharing app due to its Chinese ownership by way of parent company ByteDance and the potential risk of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. user data being accessed by the Chinese government. This ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">resulted</a> in President Trump&#8217;s decision to use his executive order power to ban TikTok from the U.S. market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Second federal judge rules against Trump administration&#8217;s TikTok ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/embed/#?secret=zmt4hnb39K" data-secret="zmt4hnb39K" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TikTok, in response, had vowed to fight the order in court while it also entered negotiations with American companies over the potential sell-off of its U.S. operations, in case the order was upheld.</p>
<p>However, prior to the Dec. 7 ruling on the matter, a group of TikTok creators<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/tiktok-stars-got-a-judge-to-block-trumps-tiktok-ban/"> successfully challenged the ban</a>, when U.S. Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania issued an injunction that blocked the restrictions that would have otherwise stopped TikTok from operating in the U.S. The creators said the ban would have caused them to lose their income by way of their brand sponsorships and other opportunities afforded by the platform.</p>
<p>Following that order, Judge Nichols in the separate case led by TikTok ruled that Trump overstepped his authority in trying to ban the app from the U.S., referring to the agency&#8217;s action as &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Dept. spokesperson said at the time of the ruling it would continue to comply with the injunctions but intended to &#8220;vigorously defend the [executive order] and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, it has followed through on that statement with its appeal.</p>
<p>Of course, the decision as to whether the U.S. will continue its attempt to ban TikTok will ultimately reside with the incoming Biden administration.</p>
<p>The news of today&#8217;s filing was first reported by <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-tiktok/us-government-appeals-judges-order-blocking-tiktok-restrictions-idINW1N2H604B">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to comment on the appeal.</p>
<p>A Commerce Dept. spokesperson issued the following statement (12/28/20, 1:14 PM ET):</p>
<blockquote><p>On December 7, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Executive Order (E.O.) 13942, limited to the Secretary of Commerce’s Identification of Prohibited Transactions with TikTok/ByteDance. The court’s ruling is consistent with the nationwide preliminary injunction granted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 30, 2020. The Department maintains that the E.O. is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests. The Government will continue to comply with the injunctions and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When kids today want to learn about a new topic they&#8217;re interested in, they&#8217;ll often turn to YouTube. But the quality of the educational content on the platform can be hit or miss, depending on what specific videos kids happen to come across. <a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/">Tappity</a>, a digital educational startup now backed by $1.3 million in seed funding, aims to offer an alternative. Its video library offers entertaining and interactive live-action videos kids enjoy, while also ensuring the content itself is aligned with current educational standards.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup was co-founded by CEO Chad Swenson, his brother and CTO Tanner Swenson, and CPO Lawrence Tran.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090929" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090929" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090929" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="227" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg 2067w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=768,256 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=680,227 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=1536,512 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=2048,683 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090929" class="wp-caption-text">Tappity founders. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Tappity</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Chad explains, the idea for Tappity emerged from his interest in designing interactive learning experiences, which resulted in a senior project eight years ago where he created an interactive experience to help students learn about evolution. Over the years that followed, he began to experiment with different concepts in this area, but never planned for anything of venture scale.</p>
<p>However, Chad says he later realized there could be an opportunity to develop content based around the <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">Next Generation Science Standards</a> (NGSS) &#8212; the set of K-12 science content standards that were developed by a consortium of multiple U.S. states &#8212; whose adoption across the U.S. is now growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of parents were looking for healthier alternatives to YouTube,&#8221; Chad says. &#8220;And I really started to believe this is something that could be much bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found also that the science-based topics kids are generally interested in are often those that are aligned with what the NGSS aims to teach &#8212; like space, dinosaurs, geology and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big inspiration was just looking at the most popular books on Amazon for kids,&#8221; Chad adds, noting that a large number of these books are focused on STEM-related subjects.</p>
<p>Chad met his co-founder Lawrence Tran when consulting for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/bill-coms-ipo-pricing-is-good-news-for-unprofitable-startups/">fintech startup Bill.com</a>, and convinced him and his brother Tanner to work on the startup.</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of years, Tappity has developed tools that make it easier and efficient to produce interactive, educational video content. Today, the library includes over 200 science lessons for kids ages 4 to 10, across thousands of videos.</p>
<p>While the video clips themselves are pre-recorded, they give the kids the feeling of having a one-on-one interaction with the character on the screen. For example, if the teacher is building something and needs a screwdriver, the kids can pass it to her in the app when she asks. But they&#8217;ll also have a lot of other fun options they can do instead, like passing her tape or even throwing pizza at her &#8212; and she&#8217;ll react. The teacher may also engage with kids in other ways, too, like responding to what they drew in the app, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090928" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090928" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2090928" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?w=509" alt="" width="509" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg 1673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=224,300 224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=768,1026 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=509,680 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=1149,1536 1149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=1532,2048 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090928" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tappity</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, Tappity&#8217;s teacher Haley the Science Gal<a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/team"> (Haley McHugh)</a>, a childhood entertainment expert with over 10 years of experience, is leading the lessons, which span topics like space, life science, earth science and physical science.</p>
<p>In addition to the video lessons, kids are engaged with an in-app points system for completing activities. The app also offers follow-up emails for parents so they can track what kids are learning and further engage them.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID pandemic, and the resulting screen fatigue that comes from virtual schooling, Tappity adapted some lessons to include offline activities &#8212; like drawing with paper and pens, for instance. And on Sundays, Tappity offers more involved activities parents and kids can do together &#8212; like baking cookies that you turn into Pangea or making a volcano.</p>
<p>Tappity expects to have over 1,000 hours of video content by the end of next year, and over 4,000 hours by the year after, Chad notes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2akPe4za39k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>When the team of three applied to startup accelerator Y Combinator, Tappity was small but profitable, thanks to its in-app subscription tiers that average around $9 per month. Today, the company has over 5,000 paying customers and over 20,000 weekly active users who have collectively completed 30 million lessons to date.</p>
<p>The company has now raised a seed round of $1.3 million from Y Combinator, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mystery-science-c051">Mystery Science</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keiths/">Keith Schacht</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toca-boca">Toca Boca</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjornjeffery/?originalSubdomain=se">Björn Jeffery</a>, Brighter Capital (<a href="https://brightercapital.com/">Yun-Fang Juan</a>), former Spotify CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasehn/">Andreas Ehn</a>, Fairchild Fund, 18 Ventures and AltaIR.</p>
<p>In the near term, Tappity is working to expand its team and bring its lessons &#8212; that today are only available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tappity-interactive-stories/id1265019371?ls=1">iOS</a> &#8212; to the web. Over time, the company&#8217;s goal is to create a large library of interactive educational content.</p>

<p>While the COVID pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/vcs-pour-funding-into-edtech-startups-as-covid-19-shakes-up-the-market/">has inspired VCs to invest in more edtech startups</a>, the longevity of some of these businesses in the post-COVID world remains to be seen. Where Tappity is different from many of these remote learning startups or those designed for the classroom, is that its focus is not on selling into the school system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers have picked it up organically &#8212; we give it away free to schools right now,&#8221; Chad explains. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not dedicating any resources to it because we&#8217;re focused on the parents&#8217; and kids&#8217; needs, which are quite a bit different,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Tappity&#8217;s app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tappity-interactive-stories/id1265019371?ls=1">is available for iOS</a> and includes some free content outside of the subscription.</p>

From record-setting M&amp;A purchases to prodigious venture capital financing, the decline of major players and huge international trade fights, semiconductor companies found themselves in the crosshairs of inventors, VCs, regulators, politicians and, well, Apple.</p>

	</p>
<p>2020 was a banner year, mostly since it was the culmination of patterns we’ve been watching in the industry for years now. It’s dangerous to predict that there will be “less news” in any tech industry, but these patterns have in many ways worked themselves out, and it seems highly probably that 2021 will be a quieter year for semiconductors than the past year has been.</p>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of four of the largest storylines of 2020 and what may happen next as we enter 2021.</p>
<h2 id="Chip consolidation is in process. The question is whether it will all be approved">Chip consolidation is in process. The question is whether it will all be approved</h2>
<p>The biggest story this year in chips was the rapid consolidation of the industry in just the span of a few months. That consolidation was headlined by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia’s $40 billion purchase offer of Arm</a>, the chip design firm that supplies the blueprint for almost all smartphones and is also starting to encroach on the desktop world with Apple’s launch of its M1 processor.</p>
<p>Nvidia wasn’t unique in throwing around big money to consolidate. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/amd-grabs-xilinx-for-35-billion-as-chip-industry-consolidation-continues/">AMD spent $35 billion to buy Xilinx</a>, which makes reprogrammable chips known as FPGAs that are increasingly vital in tech stacks like 5G, where technologies change faster than silicon can be replaced. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/intel-agrees-to-sell-its-nand-business-to-sk-hynix-for-9-billion/">Intel sloughed off its memory unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion</a> as it fights for survival, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maxim-intg-m-a-analog-devices/chipmaker-analog-devices-to-buy-rival-maxim-for-about-21-billion-idUSKCN24E14B">Analog Devices bought Maxim for $21 billion</a> in a bid to consolidate the embedded chips market in areas like sensors and power management. Beyond the major headlines of course, there were many smaller acquisitions made across the industry.</p>
<p>The chips industry isn’t unique in its heavy consolidation — plenty of other industries have also taken the M&amp;A route given the relatively lenient antitrust policy in place and the abundant capital from the public markets at their disposal. Yet, there are also unique forces pushing semis to head this direction.</p>
<p>First, the cost of staying competitive in the chip industry have been rising rapidly. For the most high-performance chips, fabs cost tens of billions of dollars to construct and require years of lead time. R&amp;D costs remain high, which is one reason why VC financing of the industry has been limited in the past (although that has changed — read below). It’s just tough to make it in chips if you are small and don’t have the capital to burn to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly though, there has been consolidation on the customer side, and that monopsony is also forcing general consolidation for suppliers. Among the largest buyers of high-performance compute and storage today are the big cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Apple and a few other manufacturers control most of the market in smartphones, and even in embedded systems, the number of buyers is apparently consolidating. Customer consolidation forces supplier consolidation, fighting market demand power with market supply power.</p>
<p>Those two trends have been around for years, but they culminated this year with the M&amp;A frenzy we saw. That’s not to say that there is nothing left to buy in the market, but big players like Nvidia and AMD have made their biggest bets and are unlikely to make any more major acquisitions in the meantime.</p>
<p><b>What to watch for in 2021</b>: The big story next year is which of these massive acquisitions actually receives approval. Antitrust regulators have been remarkably sanguine about consolidation in the sector, but now that consolidation is reaching its logical end, with only a few players — or even just one — existing in their respective markets.</p>
<p>These antitrust concerns are most notable with Nvidia/Arm, which has to receive simultaneous approval from four authorities (United States, Britain, Europe and China). Experts in the industry that I have talked to have been divided on their predictions, with some feeling that the parties can “work out a deal” and others feeling that China in particular is unlikely to approve a deal. We can expect some signs of how this is going in 2021, although approval of the deal might well head into 2022.</p>
<p>AMD/Xilinx has also raised some eyebrows among experts, but hasn’t gotten nearly the press that Nvidia/Arm has. As for Analog Devices and Maxim — which is pretty much classic horizontal consolidation — shareholders approved the merger in October, and the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201008006054/en/Analog-Devices-and-Maxim-Integrated-Shareholders-Approve-Combination">said in its press release</a> then that the period for the U.S. to intervene on antitrust grounds had expired. It still faces regulatory approvals in other regions and could close by summer 2021.</p>
<p>Given the huge spike in antirust concerns in the United States among both Democrats and Republicans around platform companies like Google and Facebook, the big question is whether those concerns spill over into other technology industries like chips. So far, that hasn’t been the case, but the new Biden administration might have other ideas when it sets up shop in January.</p>

<p>2020 was another major year for VC dollars in next-generation silicon, after huge investment in 2019 and 2018. I’ve covered a lot of the exciting startups in the space, including Nuvia (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">which announced $240 million in September for its Series B</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/sifives-new-pc-is-bringing-open-source-computing-closer-to-reality/">SiFive</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/edgeq-raises-51-million-to-fuse-ai-compute-and-5g-within-a-single-chip/">EdgeQ</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/the-cerebras-cs-1-computes-deep-learning-ai-problems-by-being-bigger-bigger-and-bigger-than-any-other-chip/">Cerebras</a>, and there are even more companies in the sector, including Graphcore and Mythic that are working on exciting products. Aggregate dollars in the sector are hard to calculate, since most chip companies stay very quiet about their funding for years due to concerns about competition. Nonetheless, even just the rounds that have been announced are staggering in scale.</p>

<p>Tesla&#8217;s operations will begin with sales in early 2021 and then “maybe” look at assembling and manufacturing vehicles in the country, India’s transport minister Nitin Gadkari <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/nitin-gadkari-confirms-tesla-coming-to-india-in-early-2021-7123238/">told</a> newspaper Indian Express. How early? Definitely not next month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1343094437149229056">tweeted</a> over the weekend.</p>
<p>Tesla has for years expressed interest in expanding to India. But in a 2018 tweet, Musk shared that “some government regulations” in India had emerged as a roadblock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like elsewhere in the world, Musk has amassed tens of millions of fans in India. A handful of people paid the token amount of $1,000 to pre-order the Model 3 in 2016. Musk later blamed the local regulations for the delay in bringing the cars to customers in India.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn’t yet exist in India to support that,” he tweeted in 2017.</p>
<p>There are automakers operating in India. Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, salt-to-steel giant Tata and Mahindra currently command the auto market in India. In the past two years, Tata Motors, Hyundai, Morris Garages and Mercedes have launched new electric car models in the country, including the Mercedes EQC and Tata Nexon EV.</p>
<p>Tesla has long focused on expanding global sales and today has showrooms in Australia, Canada, China, Japan and Mexico, as well as throughout Europe. It has a final assembly facility in Tilburg, Netherlands that opened in 2013. However, it wasn&#8217;t until 2019 that the company began producing vehicles outside of the United States. In late 2019, Tesla started producing electric vehicles at its factory in Shanghai. Tesla is constructing another factory in Berlin as well as in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>New Delhi, which has claimed to abolish more than 1,000 “archaic laws” in recent years, has previously acknowledged the pain points expressed by Musk. In the past three years, India has proposed billions of dollars in incentives to car companies to switch to electric alternatives and accelerate innovation and manufacturing of batteries in a bid to reduce its spending on oil and curb air pollution.</p>
<p>India also proposed that ride-hailing firms Uber and Ola <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/india-electric-vehicles-2026-uber-ola/">convert 40% of their fleets in the country to electric by April 2026</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, a proposal drafted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-backed think tank Niti Aayog said the country could slash its spendings on oil imports by as much as $40 billion in the next 10 years if electric vehicles were to be widely adopted.</p>

		Ross Lipson is CEO and co-founder at <a href="https://dutchie.com/home">Dutchie</a>, an online cannabis marketplace. Ross possesses more than a decade of experience in advanced and equitable delivery services for a variety of industries, including online food ordering, and has executed two successful business exits.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">To say that COVID-19 has dominated the past year would be an understatement. We’ve seen the pandemic reorient how we interact with businesses, each other and the world around us. It’s accelerated many trends in business — from e-commerce to digital payments — by several years in a matter of months.</p>
<p>The cannabis industry is no exception. Cannabis was already the country’s fastest-growing industry, but 2020 has taken the space to another level. A record-high percentage of Americans now support cannabis legalization.</p>
<p>By all accounts, cannabis was one of the biggest winners on Election Day, with legalization passing in Arizona, Montana, Missouri, New Jersey and South Dakota. More than one-third of the country — over 111 million people — now live in a state with legal recreational cannabis. By 2021, the legal industry is expected to be worth $24.5 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			A record-high percentage of Americans now support cannabis legalization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Never has it been more clear that cannabis is now a staple in mainstream America. As we look toward 2021, this upward trajectory not only opens new doors for the industry, but the economy as a whole, with greater innovation, investment and employment opportunities flowing into the space.</p>
<h2>A green economy</h2>
<p>More than 57 million Americans have filed for unemployment since March. While the financial and employment opportunities around cannabis are not a silver bullet, they&#8217;re certainly not something we should ignore.</p>
<p>Legal cannabis sales reached nearly $20 billion this past year and are expected to top $40 billion annually within the next four years. As the industry continues to grow, companies are hiring to keep pace. The legal cannabis market supports 243,700 full-time-equivalent American jobs, which are set to multiply by 250% between 2018 and 2028. This makes the cannabis industry America’s largest source for new jobs.</p>
<p>Cannabis can also strengthen state economies and generate opportunities for increased tax revenue, particularly as state and local budgets dwindle. For example, with its new legalization measure, Arizona will issue a 16% tax on cannabis sales that will go toward community colleges, police, fire departments and public health programs.</p>
<h2>Accelerating cannabis e-commerce</h2>
<p>If there’s one point that’s been reinforced this year, it’s that cannabis is a highly demanded and indispensable consumer good.</p>
<p>At the height of widespread shelter-in-place orders this spring, dispensaries were classified as &#8220;essential&#8221; in many states alongside grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. While people couldn’t shop at department stores or go to the movies, they could still purchase from their local dispensary. This government recognition was a major signal to the market that the space has been elevated to the mainstream.</p>
<p>A resounding response from consumers followed with record cannabis sales. Unprecedented demand forced cannabis retailers to revolutionize the ways they do business and how customers purchase products. To minimize direct person-to-person contact that can potentially spread the virus, dispensaries turned quickly to e-commerce and digital payment solutions to keep employees and consumers safe while modernizing their business.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes across industries, online sales will reach $794.5 billion by the end of the year, far surpassing original estimates. Experts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce by five years. At Dutchie, we’ve seen this firsthand. Since March, we’ve experienced a 700% surge in online orders and a 32% increase in average order size.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead to 2021</h2>
<p>These political and business transformations were milestones that we&#8217;ve fast-forwarded to at breakneck speed. So, what comes next?</p>
<p>I see technological innovation at the forefront of the legal industry moving forward. Technology will enable dispensaries to streamline operations in a highly regulated space where compliance is essential. In turn, data will increasingly become more important as retailers will need to better understand their data to make more proactive, informed decisions. This will be a focus for dispensaries of all sizes, but in particular larger businesses that are looking for an increasingly high level of sophistication for their online experiences.</p>
<p>To meet this need, we’re finally seeing new enterprise-level solutions on the market that empower dispensaries to fully leverage their data to design their unique online identity so they can remain competitive as more players join the space.</p>
<p>As legalization continues to spread, wider adoption will further legitimize the industry and de-stigmatize cannabis sales and use. We will likely see cannabis companies attracting more top talent from some of the most notable companies across mainstream industries, and more software platforms, businesses and investors that were formerly hesitant to enter the space begin to work with and invest in cannabis-related businesses. Federal legalization of cannabis also has the potential to enhance liquidity and open the floodgates to more investment deals.</p>
<p>Additionally, as we’ve already begun to see, there will be an increasing trend toward consolidation across the space as retailers continue to make big acquisitions and mergers. More multistate operators will consume smaller players and smaller players will combine forces, creating a space that is more cohesive and less fragmented.</p>
<h2>The future of cannabis</h2>
<p>The cannabis industry is still in its infancy, but its potential is crystal clear.</p>
<p>As more states legalize and the industry grows and matures, we will see the needle move even closer to where we want to be: Where legal cannabis is afforded the same technological and financial resources as other mainstream industries; innovators can more freely come together to develop modern technology solutions to push the space forward; and where consumers and patients can get what they want more conveniently.</p>
