										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s status in the U.S. has been one of many question marks hovering over the newly minted Biden administration. The smartphone maker was one of a number of Chinese companies added to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list” during Trump’s four years in office.</p>
<p>Gina Raimondo, Joe Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary, has offered what is potentially one of the clearest looks so far at how Huawei’s status might (or might not) evolve under a new administration. Responding to questions from Senate Republicans, former Rhode Island Governor Raimondo indicated that the Biden administration likely would not be in any hurry to remove Huawei from the blacklist.</p>
<p>Republican House members had previously<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/536979-house-republicans-urge-senate-to-block-vote-on-commerce-secretary-over"> raised concerns</a> over Raimondo&#8217;s position on companies like Huawei, a stance she had yet to clarify. “We urge those Senators who have a history of calling for Huawei to remain on the Entity List to stick to their principles and place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies their intentions for Huawei and on export control policies for a country that is carrying out genocide and threatening our national security,&#8221; they wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raimondo has since responded.</p>
<p>“I understand that parties are placed on the Entity List and the Military End User List generally because they pose a risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” the politician said, in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist">note reported by Bloomberg</a>. “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/">Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/embed/#?secret=QcTAFkiGNv" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The statement isn’t definitive in either direction (as is perhaps to be expected for a Cabinet nominee), but it certainly doesn’t point to a radical change from Trump’s position on the issue. The smartphone marker was added to the list in 2019, following longtime accusations over security and spying concerns. The company has also variously been tied to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The DoC noted at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration proved especially aggressive in regards to blacklisting Chinese tech companies, a fact that has already had a profound impact on Huawei’s bottom line. Drone giant DJI and AI company SenseTime have been added to the DoC list, while Xiaomi made a separate military blacklist in the waning days of the administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Democrats settle into control of both chambers of Congress, signs of the party&#8217;s legislative priorities are starting to manifest. So far, lawmakers&#8217; interest in reimagining tech&#8217;s regulatory landscape appears to be alive and well.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is out with a new proposal for antitrust reform that would create more barriers for big mergers and beef up federal resources for antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar&#8217;s bill, the <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/1/e171ac94-edaf-42bc-95ba-85c985a89200/375AF2AEA4F2AF97FB96DBC6A2A839F9.sil21191.pdf">Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a>, seeks to address consolidation across industries, calling out &#8220;dominant digital platforms&#8221; specifically.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem,&#8221; Klobuchar said. &#8220;We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klobuchar now leads the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, a corner of Congress already signaling its interest on reform that would impact big tech.</p>
<p>The new bill would bolster the Clayton Antitrust Act, a 1914 bill that created a framework for the rules around competition that are still applied today. Specifically, it would amend that bill to reinterpret its standard for evaluating anti-competitive mergers, changing the language to prevent any deal that &#8220;create[s] an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition&#8221; rather than the current wording.</p>
<p>The aim is to catch potentially anti-competitive behavior earlier in the game — an outcome that would address the government&#8217;s current conundrum, in which federal regulators are now awkwardly reevaluating mergers that evolved into monopolistic behavior years after the fact.</p>
<p>The bill would also put the onus on merging companies to prove that they don&#8217;t pose a risk of reducing competition, taking that burden off of the government in specific cases. Those rules would apply to &#8220;mega-mergers&#8221; worth $5 billion or more and in which a company with 50 percent market share seeks to buy a current or potential competitor.</p>
<p>Klobuchar&#8217;s proposal also seeks to add a provision to the Clayton Act against conduct that puts competitors at a disadvantage — a rule that would address some of the murkier areas of anti-competitive behavior that stretch beyond outright mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Citing lacking enforcement budgets, the bill also sets out a $300 million infusion for the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division and the FTC. At the FTC, that money would help create a new division within the agency for research on markets and mergers.</p>
<p>The bill will be co-sponsored by Senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, all Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee. And while it&#8217;s a single party endeavor for now, the antitrust reform could attract support from Republicans in Congress like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-ban-big-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions">signaled his interest</a> in antitrust changes that target large tech companies as recently as this week. Hawley also sits on the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee.</p>
<p>Klobuchar stops short of calling for large tech companies like Facebook and Google to be broken into their component parts, a move that has attracted some support from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/presidential-hopeful-elizabeth-warren-is-calling-for-the-breakup-of-big-tech/">lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/bernie-sanders-break-up-google-amazon-apple-1369255">Bernie Sanders</a> in recent years. In the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">emerging multi-state lawsuits targeting big tech companies</a>, the FTC announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">own antitrust case against Facebook</a> late last year, pushing for the company to be broken up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) has found a strong foothold in the world of enterprise IT through its effective use of AI and other technology to help automate repetitive tasks, to free up people to focus on more complicated work. Today, a startup called <a href="http://infinitus.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinitus</a> is coming out of stealth to apply this concept to the world of healthcare &#8212; specifically, to speed up the process of voice communication between entities in the fragmented U.S. healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Infinitus uses &#8220;voice RPA&#8221; to become the machine-generated voice that makes calls from, say, healthcare providers or pharmacies to insurance companies to go through a series of questions (directed at humans at the other end) that typically need to be answered before payments are authorized and other procedures can take place. Those conversations are then ingested into Infinitus&#8217;s platform to parse them for relevant information that is input into the right fields to trigger whatever actions need to happen as a result of the calls.</p>
<p>The startup is coming out of &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; today but it has been around for a couple of years already and has signed on a number of large healthcare companies as customers &#8212; for example, the wholesale drug giant <a href="https://www.amerisourcebergen.com/insights/manufacturers/harnessing-the-power-of-a-digital-assistant-to-accelerate-patient-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AmerisourceBergen</a> &#8212; and is in some cases contributing its technology to public health efforts around the current coronavirus pandemic, with one organization currently using it to <a href="https://infinitus.ai/blog-posts/vaccinateca-covid19-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate a mass calling system</a> across several states to get a better idea of vaccine availability to help connect the earliest doses with the most vulnerable groups that need them the fastest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It made 75,000 calls on behalf of 12,000 providers in January alone.</p>
<p>Infinitus&#8217; public launch is also coming with a funding kicker: it has picked up $21.4 million in Series A funding from a group of big-name investors to build the business.</p>
<p>The round is being co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue, with Gradient Ventures (Google&#8217;s early stage AI fund), Quiet Capital, Firebolt Ventures and Tau Ventures also participating, along with individual investments from a selection of executives across the worlds of AI and big tech: Ian Goodfellow, Gokul Rajaram, Aparna Chennapragada and Qasar Younis.</p>
<p>Coatue is shaping up to be a huge investor in the opportunity in RPA. Earlier this week, it emerged that it co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest investment in UiPath</a>, one of the leaders in the space, having been a part of previous rounds as well.</p>
<p>“Coatue is proud to have led the Series A in Infinitus,” says Yanda Erlich, a general partner at Coatue. “We are big believers in the transformative power of RPA and Enterprise Automation. We believe Infinitus’ VoiceRPA solution enables healthcare organizations to automate previously costly and manual calls and faxes and empowers these organizations to see benefits from end-to-end process automation.”</p>
<p>The problem that Infinitus is addressing is the fact that healthcare, in particular in the privatized U.S. market, has a lot of time-consuming and often confusing red tape when it comes to getting things done. And a lot of the most immediate pain points of that process can be found in voice calls, which are the primary basis of critical communications between different entities in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Voice calls are used to initiate most processes, whether it&#8217;s to obtain critical information, follow up on a form or previous communication, or pass on some data, or of course provide clearance for a payment.</p>
<p>There are 900 million calls of these kinds made in the U.S., with the average length of each call 35 minutes, and with the average healthcare professional who works in an administrative role to make those calls dedicating some 4.5 hours each day to being on the phone.</p>
<p>All of this ultimately adds to the exorbitant costs of healthcare services in the U.S. (and likely some of those inscrutable lines of fees that you might see on bills), not to mention delays in giving care. (And those volumes underscore just what a small piece Infinitus touches today.)</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Ankit Jain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and ex-Googler who held senior roles in engineering and was a founding partner at Gradient at the search giant &#8212; told TechCrunch in an interview that the idea for Infinitus first occured to him a couple of years ago, when he was still at Gradient.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were starting to see a lot of improvements in voice communications technology, turning text into speech and speech into text. I realised that it would soon be possible to automate phone calls where a machine could carry out a full conversation with someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, around that time, Google itself had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched Duplex, </a>a service built around the same principle<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, </a>but aimed at consumers, for people to book appointments, restaurant tables and other services.</p>
<p>He determined that just being able to talk like a human and understand natural language wasn&#8217;t the only issue, and not even the main one, in enterprises applications like healthcare environments, which rely on specific jargon and particular scenarios that are probably <em>less</em> rather than more like actual human interactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, if someone wanted to build this for healthcare it would change it,&#8221; he said. And so he decided to do just that.</p>
<p class="p1">Jain said that Infinitus is using public cloud speech to text systems but the natural language processing and flows to triage and use the information gained from the conversations are built in house. The specialization of the content and interactions potentially is also one reason why Infinitus might not worry so soon about cannibalization from bigger RPA players, at least for now.</p>
<p>The fact that services like these &#8212; the new generation of robocalls, as it were &#8212; can sound &#8220;lifelike&#8221;, like actual humans, has been something that consumer versions have aspired to, although that hasn&#8217;t always worked out for the best. Duplex, for example, in its early days <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came under criticism</a> for how it&#8217;s excellent quality might actually be deceptive, because it wasn&#8217;t clear to users they were speaking to a machine logging their responses in a data harnessing exercise. Jain notes that Infinitus is actually intentionally choosing voices that sound like bots to help make that clear to those taking the calls.</p>
<p>He said that this also &#8220;helps reduce the level of chatter&#8221; on the conversation and keep the person speaking focused on business.</p>
<p>On that front, it seems that while Infinitus works like other voice RPA services, connected up with live, human agents who can take over calls if they get tricky, that hasn&#8217;t really needed to be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we don’t need to triage with humans because we see high enough success rates with our system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>You might wonder, why hasn&#8217;t the healthcare industry just moved past voice altogether? Surely there are ways of exchanging data between entities so that calls could become obsolete? Turns out that at least for now that isn&#8217;t something that will change quickly, Jain said.</p>
<p>Part of it is because the fragmentation in the market means it&#8217;s hard to implement new standards across the board, covering hundreds of insurance payers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical groups, billing and collections organisations and more. And when it comes down to it, a phone call ends up being the easiest route for many admins who might have to typically deal with 100 different payment companies and other entities, each with a different logging mechanism. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of cognitive load, so it&#8217;s often easier to just pick up the phone,&#8221; Jain said.</p>
<p>Bringing in voiceRPA like Infinitus&#8217;s is part of that long haul to update the bigger system.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;By automating one side we are showing the other side that it can be done,&#8221; Jain said. &#8220;Right now, there are just too many players and getting them agree on one standard is a gargantuan task, so trying to winning one small piece after another is how it’s done. It should not be voice, but by the time standards bodies agree on something else, the world has moved on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As startups have stayed private longer and liquidity has become harder to secure for early employees and investors, more and more shareholders have looked for ways to unload their shares to others. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/17/secondmarket-115-million-q1/">All the way back in 2011</a>, companies like SecondMarket were seeing nine-figures&#8217; worth of shares being traded on their secondary share platforms.</p>
<p>That wave of liquidity startups ran into two problems: One was regulatory, and the other was a lack of company information about cap tables and that company’s current financial picture. Stock buyers were essentially flying blind while buying into companies, which some investors were more than willing to do, but that blindness limited the market demand for secondary shares significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://carta.com">Carta</a> is hoping that its base as the cap table management solution of choice for many startups will allow it to parlay that position into a new service it has called <a href="https://cartax.com/">CartaX</a>. We’ve heard rumblings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/carta-was-just-valued-at-1-7-billion-by-andreessen-horowitz-in-a-deal-some-see-as-rich/">about the service for more than a year now</a>, but <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97">according to a new blog post by founder Henry Ward</a>, it looks like the product is exiting beta and starting to operate in the real world with real money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yesterday, Carta sold just shy of $100 million of its shares across 1,484 market orders to 414 participants through its own CartaX product at a price of $6.9 billion. Ward says that is up from the $3.1 billion valuation of the company’s Series F round from last year.</p>
<p>As a comparison, secondary transactions typically involve secondary buyers who negotiate these deals manually one-on-one with individual sellers. What makes CartaX interesting is that it could allow for much faster and more frequent secondary sales at companies based on the same sort of computerized trading models that currently power the stock market.</p>
<p>Liquidity is a huge issue for startups, and while CartaX is just getting going, it fulfills a key need for many participants in the startup ecosystem, and it’s a key financial product to watch as it expands in 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenues are looking good at Carta these days. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/revenue-climbs-at-carta-a-vc-favorite-now-valued-at-6-9-billion-after-private-stock-sales">According to an article earlier today by Zoë Bernard and Cory Weinberg at The Information</a>, Carta has an ARR of $150 million. That’s a 46x revenue multiple if all the numbers are correct, which these days is good if not great for SaaS companies approaching the public markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter is upping its data analytics game in the form of an expanded, multiyear partnership with Google Cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social media giant first began working with Google in 2018 to </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2018/a-new-collaboration-with-google-cloud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move Hadoop cluster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s to the Google Cloud platform as a part of its </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/the-start-of-a-journey-into-the-cloud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partly Cloudy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the expanded agreement, Twitter will move its offline analytics, data processing and machine learning workloads to</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/google-cloud-leads-in-cloud-data-analytics-and-databases"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s Data Cloud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Sudhir Hasbe, Google Cloud’s director of product management and data analytics, to better understand just what this means. He said the move will give Twitter the ability to analyze data faster as part of its goal to provide a better user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, behind every tweet, like and retweet, there is a series of data points that helps Twitter understand things like just how people are using the service, and what type of content they might want to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s data platform ingests trillions of events, processes hundreds of petabytes of data and runs tens of thousands of jobs on over a dozen clusters daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By expanding its partnership with Google, Twitter is essentially adopting the company’s Data Cloud, including BigQuery, Dataflow, BigTable and machine learning (ML) tools to make more sense of, and improve, how Twitter features are used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal said in a written statement that the company’s initial partnership was successful and led to enhanced productivity on the part of its engineering teams.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Building on this relationship and Google’s technologies will allow us to learn more from our data, move faster and serve more relevant content to the people who use our service every day,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud’s Hasbe believes that organizations like Twitter need a highly scalable analytics platform so they can derive value from all their data collecting. By expanding its partnership with Google, Twitter is able to add significantly more use cases out of its cloud platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform is serverless and we can help organizations, like Twitter, automatically scale up and down,” Hasbe told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Twitter can bring massive amounts of data, analyze and get insights without the burden of having to worry about infrastructure or capacity management or how many machines or servers they might need,” he added. “None of that is their problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift will also make it easier for Twitter’s data scientists and other similar personnel to build machine learning models and do predictive analytics, according to Hasbe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other organizations that have recently turned to Google Cloud to help navigate the pandemic include </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0917/bedbathbeyond"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed, Bath and Beyond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0110/wayfair-google-cloud"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayfair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0219/etsy-completes-migration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://diginomica.com/home-depot-builds-firm-data-foundation-google-big-query-meet-changing-customer-demands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Home Depot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 2, TC’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"><b>Frederic Lardinois</b></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/google-cloud-lost-5-6b-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud is seeing accelerated revenue growth, its losses are also increasing. This week, Google </span><a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operating income/loss for its Google Cloud business unit in its quarterly earnings. Google Cloud lost $5.6 billion in Google’s fiscal year 2020, which ended December 31. That’s on $13 billion of revenue.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual health and wellness platforms have grown <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coronavirus-impact-sends-app-downloads-usage-and-consumer-spending-to-record-highs-in-q2/">increasingly popular throughout the pandemic</a>, but a new startup wants to focus that effort exclusively on senior citizens. <a href="https://www.agebold.com">Bold</a>, a digital health and wellness service, plans to prevent chronic health problems in older adults through free and personalized exercise programs. Co-founded by Amanda Rees and her partner Hari Arul, Bold picked up $7 million this week in seed funding led by Julie Yoo of Silicon Valley-based Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>Rees said in an interview that the idea for Bold came from time she spent caring for her grandmother, helping her through health challenges like falls. “I kept thinking about solutions we could build to keep someone healthier longer, rather than waiting for until they have a fall or something else goes off the rails to intervene,” she said. Rees started Bold to use what she’d learned from her own experience in dance and yoga to help her grandmother practice maintaining balance to prevent future falls. “My passion really was around ways to sort of widen the aperture and make these solutions more accessible and built for older people.”</p>
<p>The member experience is pretty straightforward. Users fill out some brief fitness information on the web-based platform, outlining their goals and current baseline. From that information, Bold creates a personalized program that ranges from a short, seated Tai Chi class once a week, to cardio and strength classes meeting multiple times each week. “The idea is to really meet a member where they are, and then through our programming, help them along their journey of doing the types of exercises that are going to have the most immediate benefit for them,” said Rees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coronavirus impact sends app downloads, usage and consumer spending to record highs in Q2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coronavirus-impact-sends-app-downloads-usage-and-consumer-spending-to-record-highs-in-q2/embed/#?secret=NSQOmxUNVP" data-secret="NSQOmxUNVP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bold’s funding round comes at a time of <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-ballooning-costs-of-long-term-care/">concern around ballooning healthcare expenses for older populations</a>, and a focus on how to reduce these costs for both current and future generations. While falls alone aren’t necessarily complex medical incidents, they have the potential to lead to fractures and other serious injuries. Bold’s preventative approach to falls is a more active solution than necklace or bracelet monitors that send a signal to emergency services when they detect a fall. And by offering virtual programs, they can help at-risk older populations engage in exercise while avoiding potential COVID-19 exposure at gyms.</p>
<p>Research shows that this works. Even <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/51/24/1750">simple, low-intensity exercise can improve balance and strength enough to reduce the incidence of falls</a>, which is currently the leading cause of injury and injury death among older adults.</p>
<p>Fewer injuries would mean less need for medical care, which would lead to money saved for hospitals and health insurers alike. That’s why in addition to their seed funding, Bold has plans to start rolling out partnerships with Medicare Advantage organizations and risk-bearing providers, which will help make their exercise programs available to users for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The recent Databricks funding round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">$1 billion investment at a $28 billion valuation</a>, was one of the year&#8217;s most notable private investments so far.</p>
<p>For Databricks signaled its IPO readiness by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">disclosing to TechCrunch last year</a> that it had scaled its revenue run rate from $200 million to $350 million in a year, so the new capital looked like the capstone on its private fundraising before an eventual public debut.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But I did have a few questions, starting with the price of the round.</p>
<p>At a $28 billion valuation and ARR of $425 million, Databricks is valued at around 66x top line. That&#8217;s steep, if not the highest number we can dredge up on the public markets. Of course, for Databricks shareholders, seeing the value of their stock rise so quickly is hardly a bad thing. They are hardly going to complain about having more paper wealth.</p>
<p>But what about the investor perspective? Does the price really make sense? The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://www.battery.com/our-team/member/dharmesh-thakker/">Battery Ventures&#8217; Dharmesh Thakker</a> earlier this week to discuss a number of things, one of which was Databricks&#8217; round and pricing. Thakker is <a href="https://databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-secures-140-million-accelerate-analytics-artificial-intelligence-enterprise">named</a> in the Databricks Series D funding announcement, which brought Battery into the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What was surprising about our conversation was not that Thakker was bullish on Databricks &#8212; a company that he and his firm have backed since its $140 million, 2017 round when the company was worth just under $1 billion. What surprised me was that he thinks its new $28 billion valuation might be a little <em>low</em>.</p>
<p>Intriguing, yeah? So this morning for both of us, I&#8217;ve pulled out quotes from our chat to help explain how Thakker views the market for Databricks, unicorns at scale more broadly through the lens of risk-adjusted investing, and the scale of the market some unicorns are playing in.</p>
<p>At the close, we&#8217;ll remind ourselves what Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch when we asked him the same question. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Databricks at $28 billion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the valuation part of my chat with the Battery Ventures&#8217; investor went down:</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange: I want to talk about Databricks, because I spoke to [CEO] Ali [Ghodsi] yesterday about this round, and hot damn, it&#8217;s a lot of money at a valuation that is roughly 64x ARR, give or take. I don&#8217;t understand the price, and I know it&#8217;s a boring thing to talk about. [It&#8217;s a] great company, I get their market, I&#8217;ve talked to them a bunch, I know their revenue numbers. [But] I don&#8217;t understand the price, and I was hoping you could tell me why I&#8217;m being too conservative.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dharmesh Thakker:</strong>  I, for what it&#8217;s worth, think [the price] fair. If anything, I think it is on the lower end &#8212; he could have done better, frankly. But I think it comes down to three major things, right?</p>
<p>One is the addressable market. Just think about the addressable market of data. If there&#8217;s a trillion dollars spent in software or technology, I think you and I would be both hard pressed to say, almost all of that [isn&#8217;t] influenced by some data-oriented decisioning. Whether it&#8217;s digital transformation, whether it&#8217;s analytics, data is everywhere. So the TAM is massive … I think you and I both agree on that, whether it is $20 billion or $80 billion &#8212; it&#8217;s massive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Fundraising is challenging, especially for deep tech founders who need to get investors excited about a complex technology, a complex sales cycle and a complex risk profile.</p>
<p>As a former investor and current angel investor, I have met thousands of founders, many in the deep tech space.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, here&#8217;s how to avoid making the most common mistakes deep tech founders make when pitching investors:</p>
<h2>Work on your storytelling</h2>
<h3><strong>Highlight your big vision</strong></h3>
<p>Early-stage investors are in the business of funding dreams. They chose to be early-stage investors because they love hearing about new ideas and enthralling futures. They deliberately are not investment bankers or accountants because they do not want to constantly pour over endless spreadsheets or dive deep into financial models. Similarly, they are not operators because they do not want to spend time figuring out the intricacies of a supply chain or a marketing campaign or the configuration of a product component.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Make your pitch tailored to what excites venture capital investors and avoid what does not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So make your pitch tailored to what excites venture capital investors and avoid what does not. Keep the financial model details and the warehouse system logistics information to your Appendix. You have it in case anyone wants to dive in deeper, but your core presentation should be focused on your biggest, most bullish hopes for the company seven to 10 years from now. Dedicate multiple slides to painting the picture of what society would look like should you meet all your intended milestones as a company.</p>
<h3><strong>Underscore the impact</strong></h3>
<p>As a deep tech company, your differentiation is in your intellectual property. However, investors care less about the “what” and much more about the “so what.” Investors are less interested in the intricacies of your technology and more interested in what impact it can create.</p>
<p>Formulate your slides to focus on answering questions like, “What can people or companies do as a result of your technology?” and “How will people save time, money and lives with your product?”</p>
<p>Put your presentation to the “grandma” test. Would your grandmother be able to understand and be excited about everything you share? Investor pitch meetings are not dissertation defenses. You are being evaluated on your potential for impact rather than the intricate details of your research. The best way to succeed in this evaluation framework is to ensure that everything you share is relevant and exciting to a diverse audience of even nontechnical folks.</p>
<h3><strong>Try to reach hearts and minds</strong></h3>
<p>Five million people are a statistic, but one person is a story. When people read data on massive populations of people, they conceptually understand the implications but only on a logical level, not an emotional one. When pitching, you want to reach the hearts of investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.moka.care">moka.care</a>, a French startup that has built several services that should help you improve your psychological well-being. The company sells its solution to employers directly. They can then offer access to moka.care to their employees.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $3 million (€2.5 million) funding round from <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, the VC firm founded by former Alven partners Jeremy Uzan and Raffi Kamber. A long list of business angels are also participating in today’s round, such as Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia), Ning Li (Made.com, Typology), Florian Douetteau (Dataiku), Céline Lazorthes (Leetchi, MangoPay), Pierre Dubuc (OpenClassrooms), Marc-Antoine de Longevialle (LeCab), Adrien Ledoux (JobTeaser), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Thibault Lamarque (CASTALIE) and Côme Fouques (Indy).</p>
<p>Moka.care believes that companies aren’t doing enough when it comes to mental health. Many companies give you a phone number and tell you that you can call that number to get mental support. But few employees actually call those helplines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why the startup is taking a completely different approach. The most important principle is that people are looking for different things. And you don’t necessarily know what you’re looking for when you’re feeling down. When you first contact moka.care, the company spends roughly half an hour talking with you to understand what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>There are three main options after that. Moka.care could send you some recommendations for a practitioner — it can be a psychologist, a certified coach or a licensed therapist. Moka.care also organizes group sessions around a specific topic. It could be focused on remote work, work-life balance, self-confidence, etc. Finally, moka.care also provides content on some of those topics. You can access that content and learn more about yourself.</p>
<p>With this granular approach, the company hopes it can tackle mental health conditions before it’s too late — you don’t want to recommend a therapist when an employee is already suffering from excessive stress, fatigue or burnout.</p>
<p>Employees don’t pay for the first sessions as it’s part of moka.care’s plans. This way, the barrier to entry should be much lower for employees. Of course, if you want to book further appointments, you’ll have to pay at some point.</p>
<p>For employers, moka.care tries to lower the barrier to entry as well. Clients agree on a per-employee-per-month subscription plan based on some usage rate. If your employees end up using moka.care more than that, you don’t pay more. If your employees don’t use the service at all and you’re overpaying, the startup pays you back.</p>
<p>There are 30 companies currently using moka.care — it represents thousands of employees that could potentially create an account and access the service. The startup currently works with around 50 practitioners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Venmo mobile payments app is going to look very different in 2021 as it inches closer to neobank territory with expansions into budgeting, saving and cryptocurrency, said Venmo parent company PayPal, during its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company also plans to put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">its $4 billion Honey acquisition</a> to work by integrating its suite of shopping tools into the Venmo app, including merchant offers, deals, price tracking and wish lists.</p>
<p>PayPal already signaled its intentions to bring cryptocurrencies to Venmo. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/"> entered the crypto market last November </a>by adding support for buying, holding and selling cryptocurrencies in the U.S. through a partnership with the regulated crypto services provider, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2956193-1&amp;h=1362442868&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paxos.com%2F&amp;a=Paxos%C2%A0Trust+Company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paxos Trust Company.</a> At the time, PayPal noted it would bring a similar feature set to its Venmo app during 2021.</p>
<p>That time frame is still on track, PayPal confirmed during its earnings call with investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said, in the next few months, Venmo users will gain the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto inside the Venmo mobile app, along with other &#8220;investment alternatives.&#8221; (This statement refers to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/central-bank-digital-currencies-a-matter-of-when-not-if-8211-paypal-ceo-61067468">PayPal&#8217;s work with central banks</a> who are developing their own digital currencies on the blockchain.)</p>
<p>Other changes to Venmo make the app sound as if it&#8217;s becoming more of a neobank competitor.</p>
<p>For example, PayPal said it will work with its financial industry partners this year to introduce features like budgeting and saving tools as well as bill pay options inside PayPal &#8212; additions that are common to modern-day mobile banking apps.</p>
<p>On Venmo, the forthcoming savings feature will look similar to PayPal&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-can-i-do-with-my-personal-paypal-account,-paypal-cash-account-or-paypal-cash-plus-account-faq3997">PayPal Cash Plus account</a>, where it partners with financial institutions to provide FDIC pass-through insurance. Today, funds held in the Cash Plus account are eligible for this insurance only if customers also have a PayPal Cash Card debit card, have enrolled in Direct Deposit or have established Goals in their Cash Plus account. Venmo now has the pieces in place to offer the same.</p>
<p>Another change includes the Honey integration, which PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">has been promising for some time</a>. Now, the company is offering more details around what those integrations will look like. It said the plan is to integrate Honey&#8217;s features into both its PayPal and Venmo platforms in the first half of 2021 &#8212; including Honey&#8217;s wish list, price monitoring tools, deals, coupons and rewards.</p>
<p>This integration will allow merchants to target specific demographics of PayPal and Venmo customers with personalized offers and discounts, thanks to PayPal&#8217;s two-sided marketplace. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In other words, the company will attempt to capture the consumer in the earlier stages of the shopping process, when they&#8217;re browsing for deals, looking up prices or searching for specific products. Honey&#8217;s shopping tools could point them to a matching deal, and then the customer could complete the checkout process using the Venmo app. </span></p>
<p>These new tools will arrive at a time when the pandemic has forced more commerce to shift online, as retail stores and other in-person retail opportunities declined due to store closures and government lockdowns. Plus, some people today now just prefer to shop online because they no longer feel safe in physical retail stores where basic safety measures like mask-wearing and social distancing aren&#8217;t enforced.</p>
<p>This broader acceleration of e-commerce and &#8220;contactless&#8221; payments also helped PayPal to add 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter. It now has 29 million merchants across its platform, who interact with nearly 350 million consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venmo&#8217;s total payment volume grew 60% year over year to $47 billion, and its customer base grew 32%, ending just shy of 70 million accounts. The company expects its revenues will approach $900 million in 2021.</p>

<p>Venmo has been rapidly expanding beyond being just a payments app. In recent months, it has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/venmo-launches-its-first-credit-card-offering-up-to-3-cash-back-personalized-rewards/"> launched its first credit card</a>, which will be 100% rolled out by month-end, as well as QR codes for in-store shopping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/venmo-begins-piloting-business-profiles-for-small-sellers/">business profiles </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/venmo-adds-a-check-cashing-feature-waives-fees-for-stimulus-checks/">cash-checking features</a> that arrived just in time to handle customers&#8217; stimulus checks.</p>
<p>But Venmo doesn&#8217;t aim to be a full neobank &#8212; at least not yet. Instead, it imagines itself as more of a &#8220;digital wallet&#8221; of sorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping,&#8221; explained PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, speaking to investors. &#8220;This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As Venmo&#8217;s new features roll out, PayPal expects the app&#8217;s usage and payment volume to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are going to see … a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it’s going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments,&#8221; Schulman said.</p>
<p><em>Correction, 2/4/21, 1 p,m. EST &#8212;  Schulman&#8217;s note about bill pay was referencing a launch inside PayPal&#8217;s app in 2021. It was mentioned alongside other forthcoming Venmo features, which led to some confusion. We&#8217;ve now corrected this. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tryflux.com/">Flux</a>, the London fintech that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/">built a technology platform for banks and merchants</a> to power itemised digital receipts and more, has seen its lengthy pilot with Barclays bear fruit.</p>
<p>Announced formally today &#8212; but actually quietly rolled out a few months ago &#8212; Flux-powered digital receipts are now available as an opt-in for all U.K. Barclays debit card holders within the bank&#8217;s main mobile banking app. Previously, the functionality was only available within the Barclays Launchpad app, which is available for customers that want to try out experimental or upcoming features.</p>
<p>Early last year, Barclays announced that it has invested in Flux, taking a minority stake, so the strengthening of its partnership isn&#8217;t too much of a surprise. Flux also went through the Techstars-powered Barclays accelerator in its very early days. However, not all corporate accelerators lead to great outcomes as corporates are notoriously risk-adverse. This one certainly wasn&#8217;t rushed but it&#8217;s meaningful regardless, giving Flux a major shot in the arm in reaching mainstream banking customers beyond the existing challenger bank partnerships it has forged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZkvjCS1Yeq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/">Flux raises $7.5M Series A to bring its digital receipts platform to more banks and merchants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Flux raises $7.5M Series A to bring its digital receipts platform to more banks and merchants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/embed/#?secret=ZkvjCS1Yeq" data-secret="ZkvjCS1Yeq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers who pay using their Barclays debit card for future in store purchases at H&amp;M, shoe retailer schuh and food outlets, which include Just Eat and Papa Johns, will see their receipts sent automatically to their app after making a purchase. They can then easily and securely view their receipts whenever they need by tapping on the transaction,&#8221; says Barclays. Crucially, although opt-in, Barclays customers will receive a prompt to set up digital receipts when they purchase items from retailers currently on-boarded to Flux.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by former early employees at Revolut, Flux bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app. Off the back of this, it can also power loyalty schemes and card-linked offers, as well as give merchants much deeper POS analytics via aggregated and anonymised data on consumer behaviour, such as which products are selling best in unique baskets.</p>
<p>On the banking side, along with Barclays, Flux has partnered with challenger banks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/">Starling</a> and Monzo. Once banking customers link their account to the service, Flux delivers digital receipts (and where available rewards and loyalty) for transactions at Flux retailer partners.</p>
<p>Longer term, Flux wants to become a standard for the interchange of item level digital receipt data — and the proprietary platform that powers that standard — but has always faced a chicken-and-egg problem: It needs bank integrations to sign up merchants and it needs merchant integrations to sign up banks. Barclays going live properly is another significant turn in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/flux-partners-with-fast-food-merchant-itsu-for-itemised-paperless-receipts/">the upstart&#8217;s flywheel</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://latitude.io">Latitude</a>, a startup building games with &#8220;infinite storylines&#8221; generated by artificial intelligence, is announcing that it has raised $3.3 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The idea of an AI-generated story might make you think of hilariously nonsensical experiments like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc">&#8220;Sunspring,&#8221;</a> but Latitude&#8217;s first title, <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">AI Dungeon</a>, is an impressively open-ended (and coherent) text adventure game where you can choose from a wide variety of genres and characters.</p>
<p>Unlike a classic text adventure like Zork — where players quickly become familiar with &#8220;you can&#8217;t do that&#8221;-style messages when they type something the designers hadn&#8217;t planned for — AI Dungeon can respond to any command. For example, when my brave knight was charging into battle, I typed &#8220;get depressed&#8221; and he quickly sat on a rock with his head between his hands.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;How does the AI know what’s a good story?&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Nick Walton. &#8220;Because it’s read a lot of good stories and knows the patterns involved in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI Dungeon actually started out as one of Walton&#8217;s hackathon projects. While the initial version didn&#8217;t win any prizes, he kept at it, assisted by improvements in OpenAI&#8217;s language generator, of which <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">the most recent version is GPT-3</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108902" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108902" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108902" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?w=680" alt="AI Dungeon screenshot" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg 3578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108902" class="wp-caption-text">AI Dungeon, <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Latitude</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The very first version of AI Dungeon I built was coherent on a sentence level, but on a paragraph level it made no sense,&#8221; Walton said. &#8220;Once you get to GPT-2, it makes a lot more sense. Once you get to GPT-3, it&#8217;s a lot more coherent on a story level. And so I think to a degree, these issues with coherency, the story not making sense, get solved as the AI gets better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latitude says AI Dungeon is attracting 1.5 million monthly active users. The startup plans to create more AI-powered games, and eventually to release a platform allowing other game designers to do the same.</p>
<p>Walton noted that without AI, video games are always constrained by the imagination of its creators. Even when you get to games like The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall or No Man&#8217;s Sky, with randomly generated towns or planets, he argued that they&#8217;re really offering &#8220;the same spin on a similar concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, he said that in Daggerfall, &#8220;When you go to all these towns, they’re all basically the same. That&#8217;s the problem with procedural generation: You&#8217;re not coming up with unique things.&#8221; AI, on the other hand, can come up with &#8220;something completely unique that&#8217;s so, so different every time.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108908" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108908" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?w=500" alt="Latitude CEO Nick Walton" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Walton-CEO-and-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108908" class="wp-caption-text">Latitude CEO Nick Walton. <strong>image Credits:</strong> Latitude</p></div></p>
<p>From a business perspective, he said that this could lower the cost of developing AAA games from more than $100 million to less than $100,000 — though Latitude has a ways to go before it reaches that level, since it hasn&#8217;t even released a game with graphics yet. Walton also said this could lead to new levels of immersion and interactivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this technology, you could have a world with tens of thousands of characters with their own hopes and wants and dreams,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can have worlds that are dynamic, that are alive, rather than something like World of Warcraft, where you&#8217;ve got 10 million people who are doing the same quest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s funding was led by NFX, with participation from Album VC and Griffin Gaming Partners.</p>
<p>“Latitude is revolutionizing how games are made, creating a whole new genre of entertainment gaming fueled by AI,” said James Currier of NFX in a statement. “The best AI minds and engineers are gathering there to produce games that the world has never seen before. Latitude is already by far the leading AI games company.“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As impressive as the cameras in our smartphones are, they&#8217;re fundamentally limited by the physical necessities of lenses and sensors. Metalenz skips over that part with a camera made of a single &#8220;metasurface&#8221; that could save precious space and battery life in phones and other devices&#8230; and they&#8217;re about to ship it.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to, but not descended from, the &#8220;metamaterials&#8221; that gave rise to flat beam-forming radar and lidar of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/gates-backed-lumotive-upends-lidar-conventions-using-metamaterials/">Lumotive</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/">Echodyne</a>. The idea is to take a complex 3D structure and accomplish what it does using a precisely engineered &#8220;2D&#8221; surface — not actually two-dimensional, of course, but usually a plane with features measured in microns.</p>
<p>In the case of a camera, the main components are of course a lens (these days it&#8217;s usually several stacked), which corrals the light, and an image sensor, which senses and measures that light. The problem faced by cameras now, particularly in smartphones, is that the lenses can&#8217;t be made much smaller without seriously affecting the clarity of the image. Likewise sensors are nearly at the limit of how much light they can work with. Consequently most of the photography advancements of the last few years have been done on the computational side.</p>

<p>Using an engineered surface that does away with the need for complex optics and other camera systems has been a goal for years. Back in 2016 I wrote about a NASA project that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/moth-eyes-inspired-the-design-of-this-hypersensitive-camera/">took inspiration from moth eyes</a> to create a 2D camera of sorts. It&#8217;s harder than it sounds, though — usable imagery has been generated in labs, but it&#8217;s not the kind of thing that you take to Apple or Samsung.</p>
<p>Metalenz aims to change that. The company&#8217;s tech is built on the work of Harvard&#8217;s Frederico Capasso, who has been publishing on the science behind metasurfaces for years. He and <span id="m_7014018653220318688gmail-m_5304010451562732722gmail-docs-internal-guid-46472761-7fff-b5e1-8371-b9b5f5e61db6">Rob Devlin, who did his doctorate work in Capasso&#8217;s lab, co-founded the company to commercialize their efforts.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Early demos were extremely inefficient,&#8221; said Devlin of the field&#8217;s first entrants. &#8220;You had light scattering all over the place, the materials and processes were non-standard, the designs weren&#8217;t able to handle the demands that a real world throws at you. Making one that works and publishing a paper on it is one thing, making 10 million and making sure they all do the same thing is another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their breakthrough — if years of hard work and research can be called that — is the ability not just to make a metasurface camera that produces decent images, but to do it without exotic components or manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really using all standard semiconductor processes and materials here, the exact same equipment — but with lenses instead of electronics,&#8221; said Devlin. &#8220;We can already make a million lenses a day with our foundry partners.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108534" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108534" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2108534" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png" alt="Diagram comparing the multi-lens barrel of a conventional phone camera, and their simpler &quot;meta-optic&quot;" width="1024" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png 1118w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108534" class="wp-caption-text">The thing at the bottom is the chip where the image processor and logic would be, but the meta-optic could also integrate with that. the top is a pinhole.</p></div></p>
<p>The first challenge is more or less contained in the fact that incoming light, without lenses to bend and direct it, hits the metasurface in a much more chaotic way. Devlin&#8217;s own PhD work was concerned with taming this chaos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light on a macro [i.e. conventional scale, not close-focusing] lens is controlled on the macro scale, you&#8217;re relying on the curvature to bend the light. There&#8217;s only so much you can do with it,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But here you have features a thousand times smaller than a human hair, which gives us very fine control over the light that hits the lens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those features, as you can see in this extreme close-up of the metasurface, are precisely tuned cylinders, &#8220;almost like little nano-scale Coke cans,&#8221; Devlin suggested. Like other metamaterials, these structures, far smaller than a visible or near-infrared light ray&#8217;s wavelength, manipulate the radiation by means that take a few years of study to understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2108455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg" alt="Diagram showing chips being manufactured, then an extreme close up showing nano-scale features." width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg 1886w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=768,250 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=680,221 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=1536,500 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>The result is a camera with extremely small proportions and vastly less complexity than the compact camera stacks found in consumer and industrial devices. To be clear, Metalenz isn&#8217;t looking to replace the main camera on your iPhone — for conventional photography purposes the conventional lens and sensor are still the way to go. But there are other applications that play to the chip-style lens&#8217;s strengths.</p>
<p>Something like the FaceID assembly, for instance, presents an opportunity. &#8220;That module is a very complex one for the cell phone world — it&#8217;s almost like a Rube Goldberg machine,&#8221; said Devlin. Likewise the miniature lidar sensor.</p>
<p>At this scale, the priorities are different, and by subtracting the lens from the equation the amount of light that reaches the sensor is significantly increased. That means it can potentially be smaller in every dimension while performing better <em>and</em> drawing less power.</p>

Beyond the vignetting it&#8217;s not really easy to tell what&#8217;s different, which is kind of the point.</p></div></p>
<p>Lest you think this is still a lab-bound &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if&#8221; type device, Metalenz is well on its way to commercial availability. The $10M round A they just raised was led by 3M Ventures, Applied Ventures LLC, Intel Capital, M Ventures and TDK Ventures, along with Tsingyuan Ventures and Braemar Energy Ventures — a lot of suppliers in there.</p>
<p>Unlike many other hardware startups, Metalenz isn&#8217;t starting with a short run of boutique demo devices but going big out of the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we&#8217;re using traditional fabrication techniques, it allows us to scale really quickly. We&#8217;re not building factories or foundries, we don&#8217;t have to raise hundreds of mils; we can use whats already there,&#8221; said Devlin. &#8220;But it means we have to look at applications that are high volume. We need the units to be in that tens of millions range for our foundry partners to see it making sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Devlin declined to get specific, he did say that their first partner is &#8220;active in 3D sensing&#8221; and that a consumer device, though not a phone, would be shipping with Metalenz cameras in early 2022 — and later in 2022 will see a phone-based solution shipping as well.</p>
<p>In other words, while Metalenz is indeed a startup just coming out of stealth and raising its A round&#8230; it already has shipments planned on the order of tens of millions. The $10M isn&#8217;t a bridge to commercial viability but short term cash to hire and cover up-front costs associated with such a serious endeavor. It&#8217;s doubtful anyone on that list of investors harbors any serious doubts on ROI.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing thing is Metalenz&#8217;s first major application, but the company is already working on others. The potential to reduce complex lab equipment to handheld electronics that can be fielded easily is one, and improving the benchtop versions of tools with more light-gathering ability or quicker operation is another.</p>
<p>Though a device you use may in a few years have a Metalenz component in it, it&#8217;s likely you won&#8217;t know — the phone manufacturer will probably take all the credit for the improved performance or slimmer form factor. Nevertheless, it may show up in teardowns and bills of material, at which point you&#8217;ll know this particular university spin-out has made it to the big leagues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The early-stage carbon offset API developer, <a href="https://www.usepatch.com/">Patch</a>, could be another one of Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s early bets on climate tech.</p>
<p>According to several people with knowledge of the investment round, former OpenTable chief executive and current Andreessen Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan is looking at leading the young company&#8217;s latest financing.</p>
<p>Such an investment would be a win for Patch, which could benefit from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s marketing muscle in a space that&#8217;s becoming increasingly crowded. And, if the deal goes through, it could be an indicator of more to come from one of the venture industry&#8217;s most (socially) active investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a>, <a href="https://www.cloverly.com/">Cloverly</a>, <a href="https://www.carboninterface.com/">Carbon Interface</a>, and <a href="http://cooler.dev/">Cooler.dev</a> all have similar API offerings, but the market for these types of services will likely expand as more companies try to do the least amount of work possible to become carbon neutral through offsetting. A growing market could generate space for more than one venture-backed winner.</p>
<p>Neither Patch&#8217;s co-founders nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to a request for comment about the funding.</p>
<p>One concern with services like Patch is that its customers will look at offsetting as their final destination instead of a step on the road to removing carbon emissions from business operations. To fix our climate crisis will take more work.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/bspellacy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennan Spellacy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-grunfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Grunfeld, </a>two former employees at the apartment rental service Sonder, Patch raised its initial financing from <a href="https://versionone.vc/announcing-patch/">VersionOne Ventures</a> back in September.</p>
<p>Around 15 to twenty companies that are using the service now, according to people familiar with the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The company has an API that can calculate a company&#8217;s emissions footprint based on an integration with their ERP system and then invests money into offset projects that are designed to remove an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>While services like Pachama privilege lower-cost sequestration solutions like reforestation and forest management, Patch offers an array of potential investment opportunities for offsets. And the company tries to nudge its customers to some of the more expensive, high technology options in an effort to bring down costs for emerging technologies, said one person familiar with the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>Like other services automating offsetting, Patch evaluates projects based on their additionality (how much additional carbon they&#8217;re removing over an already established baseline), permanence (how long the carbon emissions will be sequestered) and verifiability.</p>
<p>And, as the company&#8217;s founders note in their own statement about the company&#8217;s service, it&#8217;s not intended to be the only solution that customers deploy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a class="dn jq" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f" rel="noopener nofollow">majority of climate models</a> indicate that we need to reduce our emissions globally, while <em class="ks">also</em> removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,&#8221; the founders wrote in a Medium post. &#8220;We take care of a company’s carbon removal goals, while they focus their efforts on reducing emissions, a more proprietary task that requires intimate operational knowledge. Patch complements this behavioral shift and gives us a real chance to mitigate climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>VersionOne&#8217;s Angela Tran addressed any concerns about the defensibility of Patch&#8217;s technology in her own September announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also believe that defensibility comes with the aggregation and “digitization” of quality supply. When we view Patch as a marketplace, we believe that businesses (demand) care about the type of projects (supply) they purchase to neutralize their emissions,&#8221; Tran wrote. &#8220;For example, a company might choose their sustainability legacy to be linked with forestry or mineralization projects. Patch is partnering with the best carbon removal developers and the latest negative emission technologies to build a network of low-cost, impactful projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Patch is explicitly focused on climate change, Andreessen has made a few early investments in a broad sustainability thesis. The firm led a $9 million investment into <a href="https://usesilo.com/info">Silo</a> last year and backed <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/bill-gates-backed-breakthrough-energy-ventures-backs-cobalt-hunters-kobold-metals/">KoBold Metals back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Silo has developed an enterprise resource planning tool for perishable food supply chains. Currently focused on wholesale produce, Silo said in a statement last year that it would be extending its services to meat, dairy and pantry items over the next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“The market potential for an innovator like Silo to reduce waste and improve margins is enormous and we’re excited to support its efforts as the system of record for food distribution in the United States,” said Anish Acharya, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement at the time. “Silo is well-positioned to scale beyond the west coast to help more customers modernize and transition their operations from pen and paper to software.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, KoBold is a software developer that uses machine learning and big data processing technologies to find new prospects for the precious metals that companies need to make new batteries and renewable energy generation technologies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;By building a <em>digital </em>prospecting engine — full stack, from scratch — using computer vision, machine learning, and sophisticated data analysis not currently available to the industry, KoBold’s software combines previously unavailable, dark data with conventional geochemical, geophysical, and geological data to identify prospects in models that can only get better over time, as with other data network effects,&#8221; wrote Connie Chan in a blog post at the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taken together, these investments coalesce into a picture of how Andreessen Horowitz and its pool of $16.5 billion in assets under management may approach the renewables industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced the launch of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee">Apigee X</a>, the next major release of the Apgiee API management platform it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/">acquired</a> back in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at what&#8217;s happening &#8212; especially after the pandemic started in March last year &#8212; the volume of digital activities has gone up in every kind of industry, all kinds of use cases are coming up. And one of the things we see is the need for a really high-performance, reliable, global digital transformation platform,&#8221; Amit Zavery, Google Cloud&#8217;s head of platform, told me.</p>
<p>He noted that the number of API calls has gone up 47% from last year and that the platform now handles about 2.2 trillion API calls per year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the core of the updates are deeper integrations with Google Cloud&#8217;s AI, security and networking tools. In practice, this means Apigee users can now deploy their APIs across 24 Google Cloud regions, for example, and use Google&#8217;s caching services in more than 100 edge locations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108876" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108876" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png 1758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108876" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Apigee X now integrates with Google&#8217;s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Cloud Armor</a> firewall and its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam#:~:text=Cloud%20Identity%20and%20Access%20Management%20(IAM)%20lets%20administrators%20authorize%20who,manage%20Google%20Cloud%20resources%20centrally.">Cloud Identity Access Management</a> platform. This also means that Apigee users won&#8217;t have to use third-party tools for their firewall and identity management needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do a lot of AI/ML-based anomaly detection and operations management,&#8221; Zavery explained. &#8220;We can predict any kind of malicious intent or any other things which might happen to those API calls or your traffic by embedding a lot of those insights into our API platform. I think [that] is a big improvement, as well as new features, especially in operations management, security management, vulnerability management and making those a core capability so that as a business, you don&#8217;t have to worry about all these things. It comes with the core capabilities and that is really where the front doors of digital front-ends can shine and customers can focus on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform now also makes better use of Google&#8217;s AI capabilities to help users identify anomalies or predict traffic for peak seasons. The idea here is to help customers automate a lot of the standards automation tasks and, of course, improve security at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ6DYaSZ4WI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As Zavery stressed, API management is now about more than just managing traffic between applications. But more than just helping customers manage their digital transformation projects, the Apigee team is now thinking about what it calls &#8220;digital excellence.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re thinking of the journey for customers moving from not just &#8216;hey, I can have a front end,&#8217; but what about all the excellent things you want to do and how we can do that,&#8221; Zavery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;During these uncertain times, organizations worldwide are doubling-down on their <span class="il">API</span> strategies to operate anywhere, automate processes, and deliver new digital experiences quickly and securely,&#8221; said James Fairweather, chief innovation officer at Pitney Bowes. &#8220;By powering APIs with new capabilities like reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Cloud Armor (WAF), and Cloud CDN, <span class="il">Apigee</span> X makes it easy for enterprises like us to scale digital initiatives, and deliver innovative experiences to our customers, employees and partners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Axios<a href="https://www.axios.com/hubspot-acquisition-the-hustle-0e1743eb-d29c-4caf-a419-7fd2584b1307.html"> broke the news</a> of the deal and reported that it values the startup at around $27 million. HubSpot declined to comment on the deal price, and while tweeting about the acquisition, The Hustle CEO Sam Parr <a href="https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1357099443141632002">wrote</a>, &#8220;Early in my career I was transparent with money. But I didn’t like the result of sharing that stuff. So we’re not disclosing the price and HubSpot has agreed. I&#8217;m taking it to the grave!&#8221;</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ir.hubspot.com/news/hubspot-signs-agreement-to-acquire-the-hustle-adding-content-to-help-scaling-companies-grow-better">press release</a> about the acquisition, HubSpot noted that customers are finding its products through content like its YouTube videos and HubSpot Academy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By acquiring The Hustle, we&#8217;ll be able to better meet the needs of these scaling companies by delivering educational, business and tech trend content in their preferred formats,&#8221; said HubSpot&#8217;s senior vice president of marketing Kieran Flanagan in a statement. &#8220;Sam and his team have a proven ability to create content that entrepreneurs, startups and scaling companies are deeply passionate about, and I&#8217;m excited to bring them on board to take that work to the next level.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S., we take for granted the ability to invest and trade in the stock market. So while we can get in an uproar about the various ways Robinhood may or may not be acting responsibly, it can be easy to forget that not everyone in the world has the same access to potentially making &#8212; or losing &#8212; money via trading as we do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mexico City-born Sergio Jiménez Amozurrutia, the fact that in his country of more than 120 million people, only a </span><a href="https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/SECTORES-SUPERVISADOS/BURS%C3%81TIL/Boletines-de-Prensa/Prensa%20%20Casas%20de%20Bolsa/Comunicado%20de%20Prensa%20078%20CB%20junio%202020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny fraction </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the population have the ability to invest in the capital markets just didn’t seem right. To him, the lack of widespread participation in investing is an example of the rich getting richer as part of an infrastructure “that is built for the wealthy.” The result of the imbalance is that a lot of people are locked out of making potentially wealth-building investments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So after selling Easy Credit, a consumer lending platform he’d built with Rick Rafael Bueno (whom he met in 2015 at a hackathon at Tech de Monterrey), Amozurrutia set out to give Mexicans access to something he believed they’d never had access to: an app-based consumer trading platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That platform, called <a href="https://miflink.com">Flink</a>, attracted the attention of Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Accel, which just led a $12 million Series A for the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexico’s ALLVP, Clocktower, Kevin Efrusy and Oskar Hjertonsson and existing backer Raptor Financial Group participated in the financing as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for what Flink has to offer is clear. Since launching its first brokerage product in July of 2020, Flink has surpassed 1 million users and 800,000 active brokerage accounts. This makes Flink the largest retail brokerage service in Mexico, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It averages 6,000 new customers a day, mostly due to word of mouth, the company said. And, the app was recently ranked in the top 10 of all apps downloaded in Mexico via Google Play, surpassing Spotify and Facebook app downloads, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most legacy Mexican banks cater to less than 1% of the population — meaning most Mexicans don’t have a bank account, let alone a brokerage account,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “At Flink, we’re guided by the belief that Mexico’s financial system should work for everyone — not only a select few.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Latin Americans are underbanked is not new news. In Mexico in particular, there are far fewer banks than the thousands the U.S. is home to. Those banks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes, make it challenging for most people to make investments by charging high fees, among other barriers to entry, such as large minimum deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, here in Mexico, the population is not that sophisticated like in the U.S. in terms of investing in the markets,” he told TechCrunch. “The banks and incumbents take advantage of that and make people feel like they’re not smart enough to manage their money. They say, ‘Give me your money and I’ll invest it and charge you fees.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink is out to not only give Mexicans a way to invest, but to help educate them as well. Ninety percent of its users are first-time investors, and many are millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you compare this kind of product with Robinhood or Acorns for example, the difference with us is that we need to be even more responsible with the kind of information and access we are trying to provide,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. “We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to educate on a basic level.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108474" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108474" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2108474 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108474" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Flink</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink has also built a community around the product so that people can share ideas and try to help each other, including a Facebook group made up of more than 35,000 people.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Accel partner Andrew Braccia (who was also an early investor in Slack), the most interesting thing about Flink is that in many ways it is “creating a market,” rather than building an offering in an already large and sophisticated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A high percentage of customers are a younger demographic that has never invested before, and never had the tools or opportunity to use a product like Flink,” Braccia said. “It’s a responsibility we take very seriously so we’re trying to make sure there’s a tremendous amount of education and transparency in the process.”</span></p>
<p>He also believes Flink&#8217;s story and the larger opportunity of what&#8217;s happening in Mexico &#8220;is one centered around accessibility and hope.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Flink’s product is not only coming from Mexico, but from other Latin American countries such as Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink can’t yet enter those markets due to regulatory constraints, but getting licenses to do business in Latin American countries is something the company plans to use some of its new capital to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you try to understand the deeper issues around financial services in Latin America,” Amozurrutia said, “you will see the status quo is really similar.”</span></p>
<p>Accel&#8217;s Braccia agrees.</p>
<p>Flink, he believes, has already created a level playing field for those who want to participate in investing in Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the vast majority of their users are first-time participants in the stock market speaks to the significance of their vision of financial accessibility—a vision that we believe will continue to resonate with other markets throughout Latin America,&#8221; Braccia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink also plans to use its funding in part to continue improving the user experience and product offering, as well as to add to its current headcount of 60 to be able to meet rising demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to get to 4 million users by the end of 2021,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, backing Flink fits into Accel&#8217;s overall investment thesis. The firm has also put money in other fintechs globally, such as France’s Lydia, London-based Monzo and WorldRemit, Galileo and Braintree/Venmo, among others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is introducing features that will allow users to take vital health measurements using just the camera they already have on their smartphone, expanding to a whole new group of people health and fitness features typically only available on dedicated wearables. Beginning next month, and available initially on Google Pixel phones exclusively (but with plans to offer it for other Android devices in the future), users will be able to measure both their heart rate and their respiratory rate using just their device&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>Typically, taking these measurements has required specialized hardware, including red or green light-based heart-rate monitors like those found on the Apple Watch or on fitness trackers like those made by Google-acquired Fitbit. Google&#8217;s hardware and software teams, including the Google Health unit led by Director of Health Technologies Shwetak Patel, have managed to develop computer vision-based methods for taking these measurements using only smartphone cameras, which it says can produce results that are comparable to clinical-grade measurement hardware (it has produced a study to validate these results, which it&#8217;s making available in pre-print format while it seeks peer review through an academic journal).</p>
<p>For respiratory rate, the technology relies on a technique known as &#8220;optical flow,&#8221; which monitors movements in a person&#8217;s chest as they breathe and uses that to determine their breathing rate. In its clinical validation study, which covered both typical individuals in good health and people with existing respiratory conditions, Google&#8217;s data indicates that it&#8217;s accurate to within 1 breath per minute across all participants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Watch 3 rolls out heart health and smart fitness features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/apples-watch-3-rolls-out-heart-health-and-smart-fitness-features/embed/#?secret=C56YFb4j9G" data-secret="C56YFb4j9G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For heart rate, Google is initially using the camera to detect &#8220;subtle color changes&#8221; in a user&#8217;s finger tip, which provide an indicator about when oxygenated blood flows from your heart through to the rest of your body. The company&#8217;s validation data (again, still subject to external review) has shown accuracy within 2% margin of error, on average, across people with a range of different skin types. Google is also working on making this same technology work using color changes in a person&#8217;s face, it says, though that work is still in the exploratory phase.</p>
<p>Google is going to make these measurement features available to users within the next month, it says, via the Google Fit app, and initially on currently available Pixel devices made by the company itself. The plan is then to expand the features to different Android devices running Android 6 or later, sometime &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108839" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108839" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Google-Fit_measuring-heart-rate.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="835" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;My team has been working on ways that we can unlock the potential of everyday smart devices,&#8221; Patel said in a press briefing regarding the new features. This would include smart devices in the home, or a mobile phone, and how we leverage the sensors that are starting to become more and more ubiquitous within those devices, to support health and wellness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patel, who is also a computer science professor at the University of Washington and who has been recognized with an ACM Prize in Computing Award for his work in digital health, said that the availability of powerful sensors in ubiquitous consumer devices, combined with advances in AI, have meant that daily health monitoring can be much more accessible than ever before.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2FaC4U8n5w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/google-fit-gets-improved-activity-logging-and-a-breathing-exercise/">Google Fit gets improved activity logging and a breathing exercise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Fit gets improved activity logging and a breathing exercise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/google-fit-gets-improved-activity-logging-and-a-breathing-exercise/embed/#?secret=2FaC4U8n5w" data-secret="2FaC4U8n5w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I really think that&#8217;s going to be a really important area moving forward given that if you think about health care, the journey just doesn&#8217;t end at the hospital, the four walls of the hospital,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really this continuous journey, as you&#8217;re living your daily life, and being able to give you feedback and be able to measure your general wellness is an important thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google is explicit about these features being intended for use in a person&#8217;s own tracking of their general wellbeing &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s not meant as a diagnostic or medical tool. That&#8217;s pretty standard for these kinds of features, since few of these companies want to take on the task of getting full FDA medical-grade device certification for tools that are meant for general consumer use. To that end, Google Fit also doesn&#8217;t provide any guidance or advice based on the results of these measurements; instead, the app provides a general disclaimer that the results aren&#8217;t intended for medical use, and also offers up some very high-level description of why you&#8217;d even want to track these stats at all.</p>
<p>Many of the existing dedicated wellness and health-tracking products on the market, like the Oura ring, for instance, provide more guidance and actionable insight based on the measurements it takes. Google seems intent on steering well clear of that line with these features, instead leaving the use of this information fully within the hands of users. That said, it could be a valuable resource to share with your physician, particularly if you&#8217;re concerned about potential health issues already, in place of other less convenient and available continuous health monitoring.</p>
<p>Patel said that Google is interested in potentially exploring how sensor fusion could further enhance tracking capabilities on existing devices, and in response to a question about potentially offering this on iPhones, he said that while the focus is currently on Android, the ultimate goal is indeed to get it &#8220;to as many people as possible.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">launched less than a year ago</a> by Blackboard co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasen">Michael Chasen</a>, integrates exclusively with Zoom to offer a more customized classroom for students and teachers alike. The inaugural product, Class for Zoom, uses both management and instruction tools to bolster the video conferencing call experience.</p>
<p>Formerly named ClassEDU, the startup announced today that it has added $30 million to its balance sheet, upping its total funding secured to $46 million. Raising that much pre-launch gives the startup key wiggle room, but it also gives validation: a number of Zoom’s earliest investors, including Emergence Capital and Bill Tai, who wrote the first check into Zoom, have put money into Class.</p>
<p>The money will be used to grow Class’ 60-person team to 100, as well as meet international demand for its product. More than 6,000 institutions from the United States, Dubai, Japan and Europe are on Class’ waitlist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On the instruction side, Class for Zoom helps teachers launch live assignments, quizzes and tests, which can be completed by students in real time. On the management side, tools range from attendance trackers to features that allow a teacher to see how much time a student is participating in activities. Currently, ClassEDU is in a private, paid beta with more than 60 customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108367" style="width: 1014px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108367" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png" alt="" width="1004" height="691" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png 1004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Class</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Class software is only usable on Macs, but its beta will be available on iPhone, Windows and Android in the near future. The public launch is at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The startup is built entirely atop the Zoom platform, but functions as a standalone business versus a third-party integration, like what one would find on Zoom apps. Class is using the Zoom SDK, which is free, to use its back-end audio and video capabilities but build front-end interface and experience. Like any early-stage startup that relies on another business to work, the platform risk is notable.</p>
<p>At the same time, the risk comes with reward: Zoom is a household name, which helps Class reduce significant friction when selling to schools, says Chasen. Instead of a school having to replace the technology they have been using for the last year, Chasen says that Class can simply make it better.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going for the broader, larger deployments that just need to know that they have the stability and the scalability of Zoom, with just teaching learning tools built on top of that,” Chasen said. Over 125,000 schools use Zoom already, he said, which is enough to build a big business. The startup has no current plans to integrate with Teams or WebEx.</p>
<p>The startup sees the changing tide in edtech boiling down to a difference in sales, similar to Udemy’s new president’s sentiment with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/udemys-new-president-discusses-the-reskilling-companys-future/"> enterprise sales earlier this week.</a></p>

<p>“At Blackboard, we had a six to nine month sales cycle, we’d have to explain that e-learning is a thing,” Chasen said, who was at the LMS business for 15 years. “[With Class] we don’t even have to pitch. It wraps up in a month, and our sales cycle is just showing people the product.</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>
<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” he said. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they&#8217;re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric bike sales boomed in 2020, a phenomenon driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it delivered consumers&#8217; daily lives.</p>
<p>Now, Rad Power Bikes is reaping those rewards and using them to double its workforce and scale globally.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based startup said Thursday it has raised $150 million from institutional investors including Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Counterpoint Global Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, TPG&#8217;s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round — the largest of a U.S. electric bike startup — is a validation of Rad Power&#8217;s business model and its ability to expand beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019. Rad Power Bikes declined to disclose its 2020 sales numbers.</p>
<p>Rad Power is a direct-to-consumer electric bike seller known for creating robust products that combine features like fat tires, big batteries and motors with touchscreens, and even cargo carrying capacity — all at prices hundreds of dollars below its competitors.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2007, initially was a low-volume custom bike builder. That changed in 2015, after Rad Power founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh teamed up with friend Ty Collins and relaunched as a direct-to-consumer business. That year, they funded the RadRover Electric Fat Tire bike through an Indigogo campaign. The company has evolved into a large-volume seller and today has 11 different bikes in its portfolio, which are sold in 30 countries.</p>
<p>Rad Power has added more than just bikes. The company has built out its online sales platform, pre- and post-purchase customer support teams, retail showrooms, service van and a local service partner network. The company has always been profitable even as it has expanded, Radenbaugh said.</p>
<p>The company has largely been bootstrapped, although it did raise a private round of a few million dollars in 2009 and a $20 million injection of capital in 2020. To date, Rad Power has raised $175 million — the vast majority of which came in this new round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt this was a special opportunity because we&#8217;re able to accelerate investments into a bunch of areas of the business where we&#8217;ve already been experimenting for years and that we found work,&#8221; Radenbaugh said.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to scale in just about every sector of its business, Radenbaugh said. Rad Power employs 325 people today and Radenbaugh said they plan to double the team by the end of 2021. The company also plans to add more retail showrooms and service locations, continue to add more contract manufacturers in an aim to diversify its supply chain and add more accessories so consumers and customize their bikes.</p>
<p>The team that will grow the fastest is Rad Power&#8217;s research and development department, which is currently at about 35 people, Radenbaugh added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core strategy is to continue to develop new vehicle categories,&#8221; Radenbaugh  said. &#8220;So while we&#8217;ll still be an e-bike company — and we&#8217;re always going to have pedals and it&#8217;s always going to have that type of experience — we will continue to create stuff that really blurs the lines between e-bikes and scooters and mopeds and even the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>
