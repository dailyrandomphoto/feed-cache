										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a>, the London headquartered company that made its name offering international money transfers and is reportedly planning an IPO, has accused its former banking partner in Brazil of a &#8220;smear campaign&#8221; after it was accused of fraud &#8212; claims that Wise says are “false and unfounded”.</p>
<p>The war of words between Brazil’s MS Bank and Wise appears to have followed Wise securing its own FX broker license from Brazil’s Central Bank in January, meaning that its partnership with MS Bank would soon come to an end. The following month, without prior notice, MS Bank terminated its contract with Wise and informed customers that it was launching its own transfer service called CloudBreak.</p>
<p>Without a banking partner and before it had time to begin testing transfers under its own FX broker licence, Wise was forced to temporarily suspend its Brazil corridor. On the 12th of March, Wise was able to open its Brazilian real (BRL) to U.S. dollar (USD) corridor again, under its own license, and then things got hostile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an email sent to customers the same day &#8212; and shared with TechCrunch earlier this week &#8212; MS Bank alleges that Wise had been committing fraud via customer accounts. Those allegations were also repeated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXKcGs8xZL0&#038;t=3s">YouTube video</a> and text published on MS Bank’s own website and focussed on a discrepancy in the way transactions are registered on a customer’s account and with the Brazilian Central Bank.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8JffsH3G0v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/embed/#?secret=8JffsH3G0v" data-secret="8JffsH3G0v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a subsequent blog post, Wise gives a detailed and robust explanation of the discrepancy in the way transactions are recorded, categorically denying any wrongdoing, and calls out MS Bank for launching an alleged “defamation campaign”.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Wise says the accusations “have been timed to raise awareness of the launch of that ex-partner’s competing product”. “We are not aware of any investigation or accusations against Wise by any regulator or other authority, either in Brazil or anywhere else,” adds the fintech company. “We are certain that we are not responsible for any fraudulent or improper activity using customer data and / or funds. Wise is taking legal measures to address this matter”.</p>
<p>Wise’s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>In recent weeks Wise has been the subject of a smear campaign by a former business partner in Brazil. The accusations have been timed to raise awareness of the launch of that ex-partner’s competing product. We are not aware of any investigation or accusations against Wise by any regulator or other authority, either in Brazil or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Wise maintains its commitment to the transparency and security of our operations for our more than 10 million customers around the world. We are certain that we are not responsible for any fraudulent or improper activity using customer data and / or funds. Wise is taking legal measures to address this matter.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Individual solutions to the collective crisis of climate change abound: backup diesel generators, Tesla powerwalls, “prepper” shelters. However, the infrastructure that our modern civilization relies on is interconnected and interdependent &#8212; energy, transportation, food, water and waste systems are all vulnerable in climate-driven emergencies. No one solution alone and in isolation will be the salvation to our energy infrastructure crisis.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			No one solution alone and in isolation will be the salvation to our energy infrastructure crisis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the California wildfires last year and the recent deep freeze in Texas, the majority of the American public has not only realized how vulnerable infrastructure is, but also how critical it is to properly regulate it and invest in its resilience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What is needed now is a mindset shift in how we think about infrastructure. Specifically, how we price risk, how we value maintenance and how we make policy that is aligned with our climate reality. The extreme cold weather in Texas wreaked havoc on electric and gas infrastructure that was not prepared for unusually cold weather events. If we continue to operate without an urgent (bipartisan?) investment in infrastructure, especially as extreme weather becomes the norm, this tragic trend will only continue (with frontline communities bearing a disproportionately high burden).</p>
<p>A month after Texas’ record-breaking storm, attention is rightly focused on helping the millions of residents<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/us/texas-storm-recovery-monday/index.html"> putting their lives back together</a>. But as we look toward the near-term future and get a better picture of the<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1174-february-22-2021-over-20000-new-electric-vehicle-charging-outlets"> electric mobility tipping point</a> on the horizon, past-due action to reform our nation’s energy infrastructure and utilities must take precedence.</p>
<h2><strong>Emphasize energy storage</strong></h2>
<p>Seventy-five percent of Texas’ electricity is generated from fossil fuels and uranium, and about<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/16/natural-gas-not-wind-turbines-main-driver-texas-po/"> 80% of the power outages</a> in Texas were caused by these systems. The state and the U.S. are overly dependent on outdated energy generation, transmission and distribution technologies. As the<a href="https://5p860.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/nCI0DvoSg_08zd62g2Uxr3HDoBOF3pVnjdYrzMGKZSZcF77tHmY_5UsEgVTJMmDEzABG0HgaQRH0u2sUf68CJbl_UikqtBFhQckUAoJU7TKCHVTXeJok6lUZHSporb0JAkInZMjHqkNrq_Gjkh0cGXB9jOAEGn984Q7kgyuel_6NweqUhmdtP72AU96kayGaP3-fafix_dFPSnDOhO3jm6kEZQCZ240Eo1sLfldl7pPdz7c"> price of energy storage is expected to drop to $75/kWh by 2030</a>, more emphasis needs to be placed on “demand-side management” and distributed energy resources that <em>support</em> the grid, rather than trying to supplant it. By pooling and aggregating small-scale clean energy generation sources and customer-sited storage, 2021 can be the year that<a href="https://microgridknowledge.com/ohmconnect-virtual-power-plant-microgrids/"> “virtual power plants</a>” realize their full potential.</p>
<p>Policymakers would do well to mandate new incentives and rebates to support new and emerging distributed energy resources installed on the customers’ side of the utility meter, such as<a href="https://www.energytoolbase.com/newsroom/Blog/a-definitive-guide-to-the-updated-sgip-incentive-program-2020-edition"> California’s Self-Generation Incentive Program</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Invest in workforce development</strong></h2>
<p>For the energy transition to succeed, workforce development will need to be a central component. As we shift from coal, oil and gas to clean energy sources, businesses and governments &#8212; from the federal to the city level &#8212; should invest in retraining workers into well-paying jobs across emerging verticals, like solar, electric vehicles and battery storage. In energy efficiency (the lowest-hanging fruit of the energy transition),<a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/cities_workforce_development_v2_0_2.pdf"> cities should seize the opportunity</a> to tie equity-based workforce development programs to real estate energy benchmarking requirements.</p>
<p>These policies will not only boost the efficiency of our energy systems and the viability of our aging building stock, creating a more productive economy, but will also lead to job growth and expertise in a<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/pdfs/a_compelling_global_resource.ashx"> growth industry of the 21st century</a>. According to analysis from<a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/jobs-report"> Rewiring America,</a> an aggressive national commitment to decarbonization could yield 25 million good-paying jobs over the next 15 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Build microgrids for reliability</strong></h2>
<p>Microgrids can connect and disconnect from the grid. By operating on normal “blue-sky” operating days as well as during emergencies, microgrids provide uninterrupted power when the grid goes down &#8212; and reduce grid constraints and energy costs when grid-connected. Previously the sole domain of military bases and universities,<a href="https://store.globaldata.com/report/gdpe1057emr--microgrids-update-2018-global-market-size-competitive-landscape-and-key-country-analysis-to-2022/"> microgrids are growing 15% annually, reaching an $18 billion market in the U.S. by 2022</a>.</p>
<p>For grid resiliency and reliable power supply, there is no better solution than community-scale microgrids that connect critical infrastructure facilities with nearby residential and commercial loads. Funding feasibility studies and audit-grade designs &#8212; so that communities have zero-cost but high-quality pathways to constructable projects, as New York State did with the<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All%20Programs/Programs/NY%20Prize"> NY Prize initiative</a> &#8212; is a proven way to involve communities in their energy planning and engage the private sector in building low-carbon resilient energy systems.</p>
<p>Unpredictability and complexity are quickening, and technology has its place, but not simply as an individual safeguard or false security blanket. Instead, technology should be used to better calculate risk, increase system resilience, improve infrastructure durability and strengthen the bonds between people in a community both during and in between emergencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Multi-asset investing and trading platform and Robinhood competitor eToro announced Tuesday it will go public via a merger with SPAC FinTech Acquisition Corp. V in a massive $10.4 billion deal.</p>
<p>Once the transaction closes sometime in the third quarter, the combined company will operate as eToro Group Ltd. and is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old Israeli company was founded on a “vision of opening up capital markets.” It launched its platform in the U.S. just over two years ago and has seen rapid growth as of late. Last year, eToro said it added over 5 million new registered users and generated gross revenues of $605 million, representing 147% year over year growth. In January alone, the company added over 1.2 million new registered users and executed more than 75 million trades on its platform. That compares to 2019 when monthly registrations averaged 192,000 and 2020, when they grew to 440,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>eToro said its platform is capitalizing on a number of secular trends such as the rise of digital wealth platforms, growing retail participation and mainstream crypto adoption. The company no doubt benefitted from the recent rise in retail investment interest, and in consumer investment apps and services specifically, which resulted from the so-called &#8216;meme stock&#8217; activity that began with Redditors trading GameStop stock in order to frustrate institutional short-sellers.</p>
<p>The platform, which spans “social” stock trading and cryptocurrency exchange, in November 2019 acquired Delta, the crypto portfolio tracker app. eToro claims to be one of the first regulated platforms to offer cryptoassets. Its platform is regulated in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the U.S. and Gibraltar.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Bk4rQR0t79"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/as-coinbase-looks-to-list-robinhood-rides-the-crypto-boom/">As Coinbase looks to list, Robinhood rides the crypto boom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Coinbase looks to list, Robinhood rides the crypto boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/as-coinbase-looks-to-list-robinhood-rides-the-crypto-boom/embed/#?secret=Bk4rQR0t79" data-secret="Bk4rQR0t79" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The transaction includes commitments for a $650 million common share private placement from leading investors including ION Investment Group, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Third Point LLC, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC and Wellington Management. The overall $10.4 billion implied equity value of the merger arrangement includes an implied enterprise value for eToro of $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>eToro currently has over 20 million registered users across 100 countries, and its social community is rapidly expanding due to the growth of its total addressable market, supported in part by secular trends such as the growth of digital wealth platforms and the rise in retail participation.</p>
<p>It expects to receivedapproval from FINRA for a broker dealer license, with plans to launch stocks in the U.S. in the second half of 2021. In a written statement, FinTech V chairman Betsy Cohen said that its sponsor platform Fintech Masala seeks out companies “with outsized growth, effective controls and excellent management teams.”</p>
<p>“eToro meets all three of these criteria,” she added. “In the last few years, eToro has solidified its position as the leading online social trading platform outside the U.S., outlined its plans for the U.S. market, and diversified its income streams. It is now at an inflection point of growth, and we believe eToro is exceptionally positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in a way that no one could have ever anticipated, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd as more people conduct more services online and via mobile devices, businesses have had to work even harder to validate users and security. One company working to serve that need, <a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a> — which uses AI and machine learning to verify identities — announced Tuesday that it has raised $100 million in a Series D funding round at a $1.3 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how much of our lives have shifted online, it’s no surprise that the U.S. digital identity market is projected to increase to over $30 billion by 2023 from just under $15 billion in 2019, according to</span><a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/"> One World Identity</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has led to skyrocketing demand for the services provided by identity verification companies. </span></p>
<p>The founding team set out on a mission to be able to verify 100% of &#8220;good IDs&#8221; in real-time while &#8220;completely eliminating&#8221; identity fraud across the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Socure has been focused on the financial services industry, but it plans to use its new capital to further expand into “every consumer-facing vertical” including online gaming, healthcare, telco, e-commerce and on-demand services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s predictive analytics platform applies artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques with online/offline data intelligence (from email, phone, address, IP, device, velocity and the broader internet) to verify that people are, in fact, who they say they are when applying for various accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Socure has more than 350 customers including three top five banks, six top 10 card issuers, a “top” credit bureau and over 75 fintechs such as Varo Money, Public, Chime and Stash.</span></p>
<p>In 2020, Socure grew its customer base by over 85% year over year and expanded its workforce by over 50% to about 240 people today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel led Socure’s latest financing, which included participation from existing backers </span>C<span style="font-weight: 400;">ommerce Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, Flint Capital, Citi Ventures, Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, Synchrony, Sorenson, Two Sigma Ventures and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes less than six months after the company raised $35 million in a round led by Sorenson Ventures, and brings the New York-based company’s total raised to $196 million since its 2012 inception.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure founder and CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnyayers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnny Ayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says his company’s identity management products can help B2C enterprises achieve know-your-customer (KYC) auto-approval rates of up to 97%. This means that financial institutions can more easily capture fraud, for example, via Socure’s single API. The company also claims that by more easily verifying thin-file (those without much credit history) and young consumers, it can help reduce the underbanked population.     </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic and resulting shutdowns resulted in a massive demand for trusted digital identity, Ayers believes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This growth tracks with a larger trend marked by the broad migration of businesses to accept applications and onboard new customers online, with many companies accelerating their transformation from digital-first to digital-only,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall fraud attempts among Socure’s existing customer base nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2020 &#8212; with certain segments seeing rises as high as 150%, according to Ayers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;These instances did not involve actual fraud but instead were flagged by Socure as suspicious and blocked prior to inflicting damage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to also enhance its product offering as it continues to develop patents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitabhjhawar/">Amit Jhawar</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will join Socure’s board as part of the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://accel.com/noteworthy/enabling-innovation-without-fraud-our-investment-in-socure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jhawar described Socure as “a purpose-built solution designed to handle the wave of new online users because its machine learning models have learned from every identity it has already seen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As former COO at Braintree and general manager at Venmo, Jhawar knows a thing or two about the importance of identity verification, especially in the financial services space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrote: “I knew immediately that the Socure solution would be a game-changer because the solution can be used in every step of the customer lifecycle, from account creation to login to transaction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure also has hinted that it has an IPO in its future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a written statement, Ayers said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are incredibly grateful for the chance to innovate and partner to solve this problem with some of the greatest companies in the world and are energized for the opportunities that lay ahead for Socure, especially as we make our march to a potential IPO.”</span></p>
<p>Via email, he told TechCrunch that the company will &#8220;potentially&#8221; look at public markets in 2022 or 2023, when it feels &#8220;the time is right for the business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dutchie.com/home">Dutchie</a>, a nearly four-year-old, Bend, Oregon company that charges cannabis dispensaries a monthly fee to create and run their websites, process their orders and track what needs to be prepped for pick up, has raised $200 million in Series C funding at a $1.7 billion valuation. That&#8217;s roughly eight times the valuation the company was assigned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/cannabis-dispensaries-online-sales-are-thriving-and-dutchie-which-connects-them-to-their-customers-is-a-major-beneficiary/">last August</a>, when it closed on $35 million in Series B funding. In fact, $200 million is exactly how much backers thought it was worth last summer.</p>
<p>Why the massive jump in so short a period? Aside from general frothiness in startup investing, Dutchie just acquired two companies, Greenbits and Leaflogix, that will enable it to become even more of an all-in-one tech platform for its customers. Dutchie isn&#8217;t disclosing how, or how much, it paid for either outfit, but the two concerns &#8212; which make enterprise resource planning and point-of-sale software, respectively &#8212; are being folded into Dutchie along with their collective 150 employees, effectively doubling the size of Dutchie, which now employs 300 people altogether.</p>
<p>Dutchie is also benefiting from some fairly strong tailwinds. In addition to a lockdown that has driven many new users to cannabis, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1">five more states</a> voted to legalize recreational marijuana in the November elections, and the federal government, which still categorizes marijuana as an illegal Schedule I drug and has thus denied cannabis companies access to commercial banking and insurance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug">appears closer</a> to decriminalizing marijuana than any administration previously.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the way the company is evolving, and regulations are evolving, we talked with Dutchie co-founder and CEO Ross Lipson yesterday about whether Dutchie eventually begins to sell directly to consumers, rather than work with dispensaries. Once people no longer have to pay cash to the brick-and-mortar shops to which Dutchie sends them, will those outfits become less necessary?</p>
<p>Lipson insists they will not. While online orders have soared over the last year for obvious reasons and more shoppers grow accustomed to the ease of picking out products virtually, Lipson says that, &#8220;Longer term, this is a retail-first model. The nature of this industry lends itself to a hyperlocal model largely because of the way that plants are cultivated and processed, so I believe retail will remain intact and continue to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see. In the meantime, Dutchie has $200 million more dollars from top backers to develop new products &#8212; including discovery and education tools &#8212;  and to begin to expand internationally, says Lipson.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management led its newest round, joined by Dragoneer and DFJ Growth, two firms that are just now making their first forays into cannabis-related investing.</p>
<p>Dutchie&#8217;s earlier investors Casa Verde Capital, Thrive Capital, Gron Ventures and former Starbucks CEO and founder Howard Schultz also participated.</p>
<p>Asked if becoming publicly traded could be next for Dutchie as investor interest in the industry rises, Lipson says that Dutchie is right now &#8220;focused with what&#8217;s on our plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for any discussions with special purpose acquisition companies that might want to take the outfit public through a merger, Lipson says it &#8220;isn&#8217;t engaged in those talks right now,&#8221; but adds that the company will &#8220;weigh out the business opportunities as they come. We look at how does this decision bring value to the dispensary and the customer. If it brings value, we&#8217;d embark on that decision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Occasionally, it&#8217;s easy for startups to achieve so-called product-market fit, but more often, it&#8217;s a struggle. Perhaps no one knows this as well as Sean Lane, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://oliveai.com/">Olive</a>, a company whose software completes so many tedious administrative healthcare tasks for hospitals that it is currently valued by investors at <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/hospital-software-maker-olive-ai-reaches-1-5-billion-value">$1.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhat amazingly, the nearly nine-year-old company raised $380 million of the $445 million it has raised altogether just last year. In fact, Olive is now growing so fast, and clicking along so well, that Lane just raised <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-columbus-ohio-insurtech-company-circulo-raises-50m-to-disrupt-medicaid-301231146.html">$50 million in funding</a> last month for a second startup that uses Olive&#8217;s same tech platform. He&#8217;s CEO of that startup, called <a href="https://www.circulohealth.com/">Circulo</a>, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impressive. It also took Lane around 28 big and small pivots to build the kind of high-growth, fast-scaling businesses that he always wanted to create &#8212; moves he&#8217;s going to discuss with us at TechCrunch&#8217;s upcoming two-day, all-virtual<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=seanlanepost"> TC Early Stage event</a> coming up April 1 and 2.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea: to save other founders from having to undergo the same anguishing twists and turns by sharing what he learned along his own path.</p>
<p>Lane had some help. Specifically, he has long credited one of his early investors, Mark Kvamme of Drive Capital, for helping identify a big opportunity amid of sea of smaller opportunities. As Lane told the outlet <a href="https://www.columbusceo.com/business/20180205/does-crosschxs-sean-lane-finally-have-his-billion-dollar-idea">Columbus CEO</a> a few year ago, before meeting Kvamme, he had a nice life in Baltimore, with a house on the water with his wife. Lane, who was once a U.S. Air Force and National Security Administration intelligence officer, was angel investing, co-running a tech incubator and had co-founded a company called CrossChx to link fingerprints to electronic medical records.</p>
<p>A chance encounter with Kvamme, a Silicon Valley VC who had moved to Columbus, would change everything. To wit, after Lane talked with him about his endeavors in Baltimore, as well as having bigger ambitions to create an &#8220;internet of healthcare,&#8221; Kvamme persuaded Lane to abandon his various projects, relocate to Columbus and focus entirely on a newer, better CrossChx.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s now looking like a smart bet by Kvamme, who wrote CrossChx &#8212; later renamed Olive &#8212; its first check. But even with Kvamme&#8217;s support, Olive&#8217;s success hardly happened overnight. Lane has said he met with plenty of resistance as he tried and scrapped numerous products. As with many growing startups that veer in a new direction, there were painful layoffs. He also eventually parted ways with his co-founder, Brad Mascho, who left the company in late 2017 in an apparent cloud of exhaustion. He&#8217;d &#8220;worked his butt off for a good four years,&#8221; as Lane told Columbus CEO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s many of these tough points in Olive&#8217;s trajectory &#8212; and particularly those product pivots &#8212; that we&#8217;ll be talking about in a few short weeks at our upcoming event. Indeed, for those who&#8217;ve struggled with their own ambitions, or their own product roadmaps, or who&#8217;ve wondered what they could be doing better or smarter or faster to grow their own companies, this is one conversation that should not be missed.</p>
<p>Even better, our talk with Lane is just one part of a two-day event exploring the many aspects of early-stage startups &#8212; check out the entire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#b0807dca-a87a-47e9-903a-86c80adef221">agenda line up here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While there are plenty of companies selling data about physical locations, <a href="https://www.safegraph.com">SafeGraph</a> CEO Auren Hoffman said his startup is “one of the few companies to sell this data to data science teams.”</p>
<p>For the most part, location data has traditionally been sold to marketers, and Hoffman said, “In the marketing world, if your data is like 40% or 50% true, that’s actually amazing.” But that doesn’t cut it for the data scientist who needs to use it to build complex models and algorithms.</p>
<p>So SafeGraph takes what Hoffman described as a “very, very rigorous approach,” crawling and merging data like business listings, foot traffic and building polygons from 20,000 sources. He also noted that while other businesses treat this data as “an exhaust that they sell on the side of their core business,” it represents “100%” of SafeGraph’s revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hoffman told me that SafeGraph’s customers are using its data in sectors as varied as GIS/mapping, local search, financial services and logistics. Customers include investment company Ares Management, food distribution company Sysco and Choice Hotels — in a statement, Sysco&#8217;s senior manager of market, customer and competitive intelligence Ben Anderson described SafeGraph as “the most comprehensive and actionable POI dataset.”</p>
<p>The startup also says that its data is being used by more than 7,000 data scientists and has been cited in more than 300 academic papers.</p>

<p>Today, SafeGraph announced that it has raised $45 million in Series B funding led by Sapphire Ventures, bringing its total funding to $61 million. Previous investors including Alex Rosen of Ridge Ventures, DNX Ventures and Peter Thiel also participated.</p>
<p>“What stands out about SafeGraph is how they’ve been able to quickly position themselves into a major player in the geospatial data industry,” said Sapphire Partner Cathy Gao in a statement. “By singularly focusing on providing the highest-quality places data to data science teams, they’ve earned the trust of some of the largest public and private institutions.”</p>
<p>Hoffman noted that the startup has been “extremely cash efficient,” only losing $3 million over the past two years, and that it raised the funding simply to “grow much faster.” Growth plans include international expansion — SafeGraph has been focused on the United States and Canada thus far, with a U.K. launch planned in April — as well as possible acquisitions.</p>
<p>He added that particularly with the pandemic forcing many businesses to close or change their hours, &#8220;having really accurate data is going to be a lot more important in a post-COVID world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can’t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another online grocery delivery and &#8220;dark store&#8221; operator breaks cover today: London-based <a href="https://jiffygrocery.co.uk/">Jiffy</a>, which aims to deliver fresh groceries and household essentials in around 15 minutes, has raised £2.6 million in seed funding as it readies for launch.</p>
<p>Backing the upstart, which already faces a plethora of better-funded competitors, is venture capital fund LVL1 Group, with participation from AddVenture, TA Ventures, Vladimir Kholiaznikov, and angel investors Oskar Hartmann, Alexander Nevinskiy and Dominique Locher.</p>
<p>Jiffy says it will use the injection of capital to launch its first stores in London, as early as this month. It plans to make the service available in Westminster, Waterloo, Lambeth, Battersea, Clapham Town, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Hackney, Whitechapel, Stepney Green and Leytonstone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will then launch a further 20 local fulfillment hubs across the U.K. later this year, and I understand is already out fundraising again. On its deck is likely a slide highlighting an executive team with online and offline retail chops, including former managers from Sainsbury&#8217;s and Deliveroo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in 2021 when you can purchase a ticket to Mars, but you still can’t get your groceries delivered on demand when you need them,&#8221; says Jiffy founder Artur Shamalov, who has previously started several companies in the food and delivery space. &#8220;The online grocery shopping experience is frustrating for most U.K. customers, as slots are often unavailable for days and weeks in advance, and some stores charge a premium fee for a &#8216;rapid&#8217; delivery that still takes up to two hours. We believe it shouldn&#8217;t be this way, and that getting your groceries should be as accessible and affordable as shopping at an offline grocery store, but with the convenience of an ultrafast delivery service.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, Shamalov says that Jiffy is creating a service it believes will partially replace the traditional daily grocery shop. This will see it offer a variety of fruits and vegetables, meats, meals and household essentials from popular brands and local suppliers, with a total product range &#8220;exceeding&#8221; 2,000 SKUs per store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make it as accessible as possible for a very wide audience: from busy parents juggling work, raising children and an active social life to busy professionals in urban areas for whom saving time on essential shopping means they are free to use it for activities they really enjoy,&#8221; says the Jiffy founder. &#8220;We also think of the many vulnerable people who don’t feel safe going to supermarkets these days. They shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about their safety when they run out of bread or milk, nor should they have to wait several hours or days for their order to arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jiffy joins a host of European startups that have raised money on the promise of delivering grocery and other convenience store items within 10-20 minutes of ordering. They do this by building out their own hyperlocal, delivery-only fulfilment centres — so-called “dark stores” — and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p>
<p>On how competitive the grocery and convenience dark store market is already becoming in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, Shamalov notes it&#8217;s still a relatively new space, and that all players are creating the infrastructure required to make instant grocery delivery possible. &#8220;We believe that within a couple of years, instant grocery delivery will become an essential part of urban infrastructure, in the same way water pipes, broadband lines and telecoms are now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So, in a sense, we are all building this new infrastructure together, and we are all competing jointly against the traditional grocery distribution channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growing (though not definitive) list includes Berlin&#8217;s Flink, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt, and Berlin HQ&#8217;d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, which has raised $44 million in Series A funding and recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">expanded to London</a> in addition to Germany and Netherlands. Also operating in London are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">Getir</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/">Dija</a> and <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>. The U.S. unicorn goPuff is also reportedly looking to expand into Europe and has held<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/"> talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Backed by Blossom, Creandum and Index, grocery delivery and dark store startup Dija launches in London&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/embed/#?secret=DBeyfFausk" data-secret="DBeyfFausk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a land grab but a capital grab, too, since the model is an infrastructure play as much as anything. Large amounts of financing will be needed to build stores and run loss leading customer acquisitions campaigns, something that is already ramping up in London. In contrast to competitors, although it is yet to launch, Jiffy appears underfunded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think we are underfunded,&#8221; says Shamalov, pushing back. &#8220;We take as much capital as we think is efficient considering dilution of the founders and building the company step by step rather than missing out on overpromised ambitions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6RN6tntRi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">Flink, the Berlin-based grocery delivery startup that operates its own &#8216;dark stores&#8217;, raises $52M</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We don’t necessarily agree that having the most funding and overspending on acquisition and expansion will automatically lead to a greater success in this industry. Hyperlocal business models require a hyperlocal approach to everything, so our focus is on expanding within just one market, instead of going globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Shamalov claims that Jiffy is seeing strong inbound interest from investors, which he says is surprising since the startup is still operating in a stealth mode. &#8220;We are confident the next funding round will be a solid step forward,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google will lower its Play commissions globally for developers that sell in-app digital goods and services on its marquee store, the company said, following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">similar move by rival Apple</a> late last year.</p>
<p>The Android-maker said on Tuesday that starting July 1, it is reducing the service fee for Google Play to 15% &#8212; down from 30% &#8212; for the first $1 million of revenue developers earn using Play billing system each year. The company will levy a 30% cut on every dollar developers generate through Google Play beyond the first $1 million in a year, it said.</p>
<p>Citing its own estimates, Google said 99% of developers that sell goods and services with Play will see a 50% reduction in fees, and that 97% of apps globally do not sell digital goods or pay any service fee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google’s new approach is slightly different from Apple, which last year said it would collect 15% rather than 30% of App Store sales from companies that generate no more than $1 million in revenue through the company’s platform. That drop doesn&#8217;t apply to iOS apps if a developer’s revenue on Apple platform exceeds $1 million.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard from our partners making $2 million, $5 million and even $10 million a year that their services are still on a path to self-sustaining orbit,” wrote Sameer Samat, VP of Android and Google Play, in a blog post.</p>
<p>“This is why we are making this reduced fee on the first $1 million of total revenue earned each year available to every Play developer that uses the Play billing system, regardless of size. We believe this is a fair approach that aligns with Google’s broader mission to help all developers succeed.”</p>
<p>The move comes months after changes in Google billing system charges <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly/">rattled many startups in India</a>. More than 150 startups banded together last year after Google said it will collect as high as a 30% cut on in-app purchases in a range of categories made by Android apps.</p>
<p>Following the backlash, Google delayed mandating the planned Play Store payments rule in India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/google-policy-cut-india-paytm-mini-app-store/">to April 2022</a> and had reached out to several firms in recent months in the country to better understand their concerns, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of mobile payments provider Paytm, India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, dismissed Google’s move today as a “PR stunt.”</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Sharma said established firms will still have to pay an exorbitant amount of fees to Google. Today’s announcement by Google, he said, further raises the question whether Google plans to address concerns raised by serious internet firms at all. (Paytm&#8217;s app doesn&#8217;t sell digital goods using Play Store billing.)</p>
<p>The biggest concern firms face today is the inability to use a third-party payments service for billing, he said. “They are basically saying that as soon as you build a business larger than $1 million &#8212; which is a very low bar &#8212; you are going to pay a 30% fee, which after taxes, becomes 44%,” said Sharma, whose Paytm app competes with Google Pay in India.</p>
<p>A 30% sales cut and the inability to use third-party billing systems have been points of contention between many developers and app store operators &#8212; Apple and Google &#8212; and led to a lawsuit by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">Fortnite-maker Epic Games against the iPhone-maker last year</a>. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had alleged that Apple&#8217;s move to lower the App Store fee for smaller developers was orchestrated to sow division among app creators.</p>

<p>&#8220;While a reduction in the Google app tax may alleviate a small part of the financial burden developers have been shouldering, this does not address the root of the issue. Whether it’s 15% or 30%, for apps obtained through the Google Play Store, developers are forced to use Google’s in-app payment services. Android needs to be fully open to competition, with a genuinely level playing field among platform companies, app creators and service providers. Competition in payment processing and app distribution is the only path to a fair app marketplace,&#8221; said a representative of Epic Games in a statement.</p>
<p>Sharma said he was hopeful that Google will address other concerns, especially because in a country like India “we don’t have any other operating system or distribution platform. They effectively control the destiny of every app developer in the country.”</p>
<p>Android commands 99% of the smartphone market in India, according to research firm Counterpoint. “Earlier India was powered by Android, then we became dependent on Android, and now it is controlled by Android,” said Sharma.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Samat said,&#8221;We look forward to seeing more businesses scale to new heights on Android, and to further discussions with the Indian developer community to find new ways to support them technically and economically as they build their businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once developers confirm some basic information to help us understand any associated accounts they have and ensure we apply the 15% properly, this discount will automatically renew each year,&#8221; he wrote. (For Apple&#8217;s program, too, developers are required to apply.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was easy to wonder what would become of Docker after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/">sold its enterprise business</a> in 2019, but it regrouped last year as a cloud native container company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/">focused on developers</a>, and the new approach appears to be bearing fruit. Today, the company announced a $23 million Series B investment.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital led the round with participation from existing investors Benchmark and Insight Partners. Docker has now raised a total of $58 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/after-selling-enterprise-biz-docker-lands-35m-investment-and-new-ceo/">the $35 million investment</a> it landed the same day it announced the deal with Mirantis.</p>
<p>To be sure, the company had a tempestuous 2019 when they changed CEOs twice, sold the enterprise division and looked to reestablish itself with a new strategy. While the pandemic made 2020 a trying time for everyone, Docker CEO Scott Johnston says that in spite of that, the strategy has begun to take shape.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The results we think speak volumes. Not only was the strategy strong, but the execution of that strategy was strong as well,&#8221; Johnston told me. He indicated that the company added 1.7 million new developer registrations for the free version of the product for a total of more than 7.3 million registered users on the community edition.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SXTy5KIdRH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/">Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/embed/#?secret=SXTy5KIdRH" data-secret="SXTy5KIdRH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As with any open-source project, the goal is to popularize the community project and turn a small percentage of those users into paying customers, but Docker&#8217;s problem prior to 2019 had been finding ways to do that. While he didn&#8217;t share specific numbers, Johnston indicated that annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 170% last year, suggesting that they are beginning to convert more successfully.</p>
<p>Johnston says that&#8217;s because they have found a way to turn a certain class of developer in spite of a free version being available. &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s a lot of upstream open-source technologies, and there are users that want to hammer together their own solutions. But we are also seeing these eight to 10 person &#8216;two-pizza teams&#8217; who want to focus on building applications, and so they&#8217;re willing to pay for a service,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That open-source model tends to get the attention of investors because it comes with that built-in action at the top of the sales funnel. Tribe&#8217;s Arjun Sethi, whose firm led the investment, says his company actually was a Docker customer before investing in the company and sees a lot more growth potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tribe focuses on identifying N-of-1 companies &#8212; top-decile private tech firms that are exhibiting inflection points in their growth, with the potential to scale toward outsized outcomes with long-term venture capital. Docker fits squarely into this investment thesis [ … ],&#8221; Sethi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Johnston says as they look ahead post-pandemic, he&#8217;s learned a lot since his team moved out of the office last year. After surveying employees, they were surprised to learn that most have been happier working at home, having more time to spend with family, while taking away a grueling commute. As a result, he sees going virtual first, even after it&#8217;s safe to reopen offices.</p>
<p>That said, he is planning to offer a way to get teams together for in-person gatherings and a full company get-together once a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be virtual first, but then with the savings of the real estate that we&#8217;re no longer paying for, we&#8217;re going to bring people together and make sure we have that social glue,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company will be embedding 100 of its researchers and engineers in a new $75 million robotics and mobility facility on the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus.</p>
<p>This is not the first collaboration between the automaker and the university. Ford is UM’s single largest corporate donor and the two entities have previously teamed up to open the UM Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles. But this is the first time Ford is co-locating part of its team on a university campus.</p>
<p>Ford clarified to TechCrunch that the arrangement is not an incubator, but “an extension of our global research and advanced engineering network.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The arrangement will give Ford space to conduct robotics research and access to students — and vice versa — from the top floor of the four-floor, 134,000 square-foot building. In addition to its fourth-floor lab, Ford will have access to a high-bay garage space to test autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Nearby, Ford will be able to drive its cars at the Mcity Test Facility, a simulated Main Street for testing vehicles in real-world environments. Ford was the first automaker to test an autonomous vehicle at Mcity in 2015.</p>
<p>The automaker’s research areas will not be limited to autonomous driving tech.</p>
<p>“The whole field of robotics has applications beyond the vehicle, that’s very clear to us,” Ford CTO Ken Washington said Tuesday. “We made the decision quite some time ago that we wanted to create a capability in robotics to apply to our vehicles, but also to have a broader potential application base, including manufacturing, including rethinking how we&#8217;re showing up in the market with our commercial vehicles, and possibly other solutions, like aerial robotics.”</p>
<p>In January of 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/agilitys-two-legged-robot-digit-is-for-sale-and-ford-is-the-first-customer/">Agility Robotics’ first order came from Ford</a>, for the Digit — a humanoid robot equipped with sensors to work in human spaces. Ford will be experimenting with the Digit in the new building as well as Boston Dynamics’ infamous Spot, the four-legged robot that can navigate unpredictable terrain. Ford will be conducting experiments with both these robot models at the new UM facility.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s general robotics and engineering research will be led by Mario Santillo, and Tony Lockwood, Ford&#8217;s technical manager in AV Research, will lead on the AV side.</p>
<p>Ford and UM, as part of the arrangement, will be developing an inclusive curriculum “to open more opportunities for underserved students,” according to a statement. Alec Gallimore, the dean of Engineering at UM, said the new Robotics Institute aims to push the field to be more equity centered. To that end, students from historically Black schools in Atlanta, Georgia will be able to enroll remotely in a Robotics 101 course, which doesn’t require calculus, to “level the playing field” for students from high schools that did not offer advanced courses.</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that Ford will have access to one high-bay garage space, not four, as well as its fourth floor lab.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As NASA is quick to remind people, the investments it funnels towards space exploration often winds up improving life on Earth – and it&#8217;s now in the business of speeding up some of that work through startups. SMART, a startup founded in 2020, has a partnership with NASA through the Space Act Agreement and is part of the agency&#8217;s formal Startup Program that aims to commercialize some of its innovations. The young company today revealed its first product: An airless bicycle tire based on technology NASA engineers created to make future lunar and Martian rovers even more resilient.</p>
<p>SMART&#8217;s METL tire is the the first fruit of the startup&#8217;s work with NASA&#8217;s Glenn Research Center, where NASA engineers Dr. Santo Padula and Colin Creager <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2020/the-little-tires-that-could-go-to-mars">first developed their so-called &#8216;shape memory alloy&#8217; (SMA) technology</a>. SMA allows for a tire constructed entirely of interconnected springs, which requires no inflation and is therefore immune to punctures, but which can still provide equivalent or better traction when compared to inflatable rubber tires, and even some built-in shock absorbing capabilities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125661" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125661" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125661" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0111.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125661" class="wp-caption-text">Engineers at NASA’s Glenn Research Center assemble the new shape memory alloy rover tire prior to testing in the Simulated Lunar Operations Laboratory.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dr. Padula and Creager&#8217;s key development was creating an alloy that can return to their shape at the molecular level, meaning they can deform to adapt to uneven terrain, including obstacles like gravel and potholes, and return to their shape without losing structural integrity over time.</p>
<p>SMART, which is co-founded by <em>Survivor</em> Fiji champion Earl Cole and engineer Brian Yennie, worked with Padula and Creager, along with former NASA intern Calvin Young, to apply the benefits of SMA to the consumer market. They&#8217;re targeting the cycling market first with their METL tire, which is set to become available to the general public by early next year. Following that, SMART intends to also pursue bring SMA tires to the automotive and commercial vehicle industries, too.</p>

<p>Already, SMART has a partnership in place with Ford-owned Spin, the bike and scooter-sharing company focused on novel micro-mobility models. SMART&#8217;s technology has the potential not only to make flat tires or under inflation a thing of the past, but could reduce cost and waste long-term by supplementing the need for rubber tires, which need frequent replacement and can be a danger to riders or drivers when used without proper pressure.</p>
<p>SMART is also using <a href="https://wefunder.com/the.smart.tire.company">WeFunder to seek crowdsourced equity investment</a>, with SAFEs currently available at an $8 million valuation cap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I am surprised that more VCs aren't investing in Africa. It smells like investing arbitrage. The pandemic has ripped the Band-Aid off investing via Zoom, making Africa is precisely as close to your in-house office as Europe, North America, Latin America or anywhere else.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital ecosystem is inequitable. In the United States&#8217; mature venture capital market, an entrepreneur&#8217;s race, gender and age help determine who has access to capital.</p>
<p>But there are other limiting factors: geography, for example. While it has been encouraging in recent years to cover what has felt like a boom in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">Latin American</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/">European fintechs</a>, or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/as-startups-accelerate-in-record-q3-europe-and-asia-rack-up-huge-vc-results/">general rise in VC activity</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/indian-startups-raised-9-3-billion-in-2020/">in a host of Asian countries</a>, the landscape remains imbalanced.</p>
<p>The pragmatist in you is already forming complaints. Yes, the world is not uniformly developed. Yes, venture capital startup hubs can take decades to reach maturity. And, yes, progress is being made in some regions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But as the world grows more connected, the tech gap between nations isn&#8217;t narrowing fast enough. And yet, given rising populations of people ready to jump into a more digital future, investment in some less-mature startup markets is lower than you&#8217;d think. (Less investment into less-mature startup markets is not a tautology; you can get to ecosystem maturity faster with easier capital access because it allows for quicker startup formation cycles.)</p>

<p>Using his figures, African startups are on pace to raise $2.5 billion in 2021 if current trends hold, a healthy increase from the 2020 figure. <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaytonACollins/">Clayton Collins</a>, a media exec, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaytonACollins/status/1371533295469617160">pointed out an interesting contrast</a>: Stripe raised more yesterday than Barry had reported for the entire African continent this year.</p>
<p>Put another way: A single U.S.-Irish company outraised an entire continent&#8217;s year-to-date venture capital sum in one day.</p>
<p>Taking numbers from Twitter is never the best way to be informed, however. So this morning, let&#8217;s do a little digging. I&#8217;ve pulled Crunchbase and PitchBook data to peek at what they say about African startup investment thus far in 2021. And we also have our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">prior look into the 2020 African startup ecosystem</a> to point to. (For more on African startups in general, we also chatted with the CEO of public African e-commerce player Jumia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Ready to get into some startup numbers after weeks of nonstop IPO coverage? I am. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>The African startup market</h2>
<p>Barry&#8217;s number of $500 million felt directional when we were discussing it, as all round numbers are. So let&#8217;s poke at it a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> of African investments thus far in 2021 includes 72 deals worth $750.6 million, though if we drill down to just companies with African headquarters, the number dips. Crunchbase lists <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/2309337181cf74544345a98dc7de2adf">$746.1 million</a> in total equity funding for African companies so far in 2021, but if we filter out private equity along with all nonequity investments, the number falls to around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/f5bf2f62ade1017e73808f837938242a">$136.2 million</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox, the gaming company that went public <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/10/investing/roblox-stock-direct-listing/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this month with a strong debut</a>, changed the game (so to speak) for the role that creative input can play in making a game more loved, more engaging, and even more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/gamefam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprising</a>. Today, a startup that is taking a version of that model &#8212; focused on in-game apps and modifications &#8212; is announcing some funding and the launch of a new toolkit to double down on that opportunity.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/pages/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwolf</a>, which has built a popular platform for gaming fans to build modifications (mods) and additional tools for all kinds of PC games, is announcing $52.5 million in growth funding and the launch of a new content creation SDK &#8212; underscoring its growth and more specifically the demand in the market to bring more user-generated content variations into the gaming universe.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform has some 30,000 creators, 90,000 mods and add-ons, and 18 million monthly users across thousands of games, including Fortnite, World of Warcraft and Minecraft. In the last year, which has seen a surge of gaming activity as more people stay home throughout the pandemic, Overwolf&#8217;s revenue has grown by 300%, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to be what YouTube is for YouTubers,&#8221; said Uri Marchand, the CEO and co-founder of Tel Aviv-based Overwolf, in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;Just as YouTube is a one-stop shop for video, we want to be a one-stop shop for creating apps and mods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series C is being co-led by Insight Partners and Griffin Gaming Partners, a VC that specialists in gaming content. Other investors in the round include Ubisoft, Warner Music Group, Meg Whitman, and Gen.G Co-Founder, Kevin Chou. Valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Importantly, alongside the funding, Overwolf is introducing a new service called CurseForge Core, an SDK that can be integrated directly into a game itself to make it easier for gaming enthusiasts and developers to build user-generated content for it. CurseForge Core is essentially the next iteration of CurseForge, the mods platform that Overwolf <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/in-game-app-development-platform-overwolf-acquires-curseforge-assets-from-twitch-to-get-into-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired from Amazon&#8217;s Twitch last year</a> for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oZYsukvbGL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/in-game-app-development-platform-overwolf-acquires-curseforge-assets-from-twitch-to-get-into-mods/">In-game app-development platform Overwolf acquires CurseForge assets from Twitch to get into mods</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In-game app-development platform Overwolf acquires CurseForge assets from Twitch to get into mods&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/in-game-app-development-platform-overwolf-acquires-curseforge-assets-from-twitch-to-get-into-mods/embed/#?secret=oZYsukvbGL" data-secret="oZYsukvbGL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The buyer and acquirer here continue to have a close relationship, even as Overwolf also looks to work more closely with others like Discord, which says something about what makes up the bigger ecosystem of communication and activity among gamers outside of the core experience of a game itself.</p>
<p>Prior to launching this SDK, Overwolf already had built out a large community of users &#8212; both on its own steam and by way of its acquisition of CurseForge. While that is entirely focused on PC games at the moment, the plan will be to expand its reach to other platforms, including Macs, console games and mobile gaming, in the next year.</p>
<p>The gap in the market that Overwolf has identified and built for is the demand from avid gamers for more tools to improve their experience of the game, sometimes very specific ones that might not be core to everyone&#8217;s experience but definitely wanted by enough people to merit their creation.</p>
<p>These can be, for example, maps to navigate your way around a game, or dashboards or leaderboards to keep better track of various statistics of characters and other players, tools to modify characters, or apps to communicate with other players when you&#8217;re inside a game. Marchand points out that he first got into this world as a mod maker himself, years ago creating a Skype app for World of Warcraft years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pivoted from making mods to making a platform for others to make mods and additions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you think about all the aspects that need to be addressed &#8212; they include telemetry, the interactive UI, analytics, installers &#8212; they can be very complicated. So we provided platform essentials to help developers figure it all out.&#8221;</p>
<p>While games developers might have a very specific vision of how they would like their games to look at play, as Marchand described it to me, it&#8217;s also a big part of PC gaming culture to be able to play around with those experiences to make them unique to each player. But handling the work of third-party ecosystems is not typically in their core competencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale and diversity of that content makes it impossible for a game maker to capture and do it all,&#8221; said Marchand. &#8220;History has proven that while game makers would like to encourage UGC they can’t and that is why we exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if building an SDK that sits inside games themselves is a logical next step, it also represents a kind of increased trust between Overwolf and games publishers.</p>
<p>“Overwolf is developing the holy grail of frameworks for UGC for both publishers and in-game creators. Enabling all major publishers like us, to allow the creation of mods in a safe, secure, authorized, and profitable manner; is a game changer for all creators and IP holders,” said Oscar Navarro, Head of Corporate Development for Ubisoft, in a statement.</p>
<p>Indeed, the tradeoff for games publishers are more tools that will potentially keep users further engaged. The SDK will cover tools such as cross-platform modding, to let players discover and install mods in-game, across all platforms and storefronts; an analytics dashboard to have better visibility on how well various mods are performing; moderation tools to better vet what third-party content gets submitted; and monetization tools to bring in more creators. As with other platforms that incentivize creators, these include an Author Rewards Program, fund investments, developer contests, and hackathons.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve been following UGC in gaming for many years and believe Overwolf has established itself as a leader in this category,” said Teddie Wardi, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “AAA game studios will want to allow creators to build and express themselves, and Overwolf is positioned as the platform to make this possible by ensuring that creators are recognized for their contributions, and easily integrating creations into games. Overwolf has proved themselves to be strong champions of the creator community and we look forward to helping them scale up in 2021.”</p>
<p>Financial incentives will continue to stand out for these creators, who today make most of their money not from paid mods and apps, but from in-mod or in-app advertising, a network that is run by Overwolf itself. Marchand said that the most successful developers can bring in revenues of $100,000 each month.</p>

<p>While Marchand likens Overwolf aims to YouTube, investors see a parallel in Unity, another key toolkit for the games developer community.</p>
<p>“Similar to how developers use Unity to build a game, we see Overwolf as the framework for everything UGC related to games. Overwolf allows for one of the only means of monetization for the thousands of creators, in turn, this translates to increased engagement for the publishers and more content for gamers.  Services like Overwolf set the stage for the industry to see a new generation of user-generated content and we are excited to invest in the leading company moving this space forward,” commented Nick Tuosto, Co-Founder of Griffin Gaming Partners and Managing Director at LionTree, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/families/make-tech-work">making changes</a> to its parental control system, Family Link, that aims to better reflect parents&#8217; changing views on children&#8217;s screen time. In the pre-pandemic world, parents were more likely to see screen time as something in need of restriction &#8212; they&#8217;d rather their kids get offline or go outside to play with friends, perhaps. But the challenges of a locked-down world and the push toward virtual learning have impacted parents&#8217; views. Google says today&#8217;s parents are more concerned about <em>how</em> kids are spending time on their devices, not <em>how much</em> time is being spent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a concession to a world where devices have become a savior of sorts to families who&#8217;ve stayed at home to avoid COVID &#8212; where they&#8217;ve been restricted from seeing extended family and friends, and where schools are closed and playdates and parties were cancelled. Parents came to realize that screen time in and of itself isn&#8217;t necessarily something to be avoided; they just wanted more control over how it&#8217;s used.</p>
<p>With the Family Link update, parents can now choose to make remote learning apps &#8220;always allowed,&#8221; so they don&#8217;t count toward overall screen time daily limits. This could include not only those apps that are used to attend school or communicate with teachers, but others that have popped up to help kids learn and be entertained, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/wide-open-school-organizes-free-educational-resources-to-help-parents-and-teachers-homeschool/">supplemental</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/national-geographic-launches-a-homeschool-hub-for-parents-and-teachers-natgeohome/">resources</a> the school suggests &#8212; or the apps parents allow during break times from virtual class.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Parents will also now have access to more detailed daily, weekly and monthly activity reports that provide both an overview of how the child is spending their time in apps, as well as how screen time usage has changed over a week or month, and what portion of time was spent in the &#8220;always allowed&#8221; apps. This gives parents a better idea of what screen time was used for education versus play.</p>
<p>On Android, Family Link users will also be able to browse through a selection of teacher-recommended apps from the Google Play catalog for kids under 13 in the U.S. And parents can also now set screen time limits directly from the child&#8217;s device on Android.</p>

<p>Though these updates will remain useful in a post-pandemic world where parents hold a more nuanced view of screen time, it&#8217;s unfortunate that Google waited until so late in the pandemic to roll out these changes. As more people in the U.S. are being vaccinated, restrictions are lifting &#8212; including the re-opening of schools in many places. That means parents&#8217; stress over kids&#8217; increased screen time usage will soon become a moot point. The devices will be replaced with in-person learning, and screen time may become villainized yet again.</p>
<p>Related to today&#8217;s news, Google has launched a new website for families whose kids are beginning to use technology (<a href="http://families.google/?utm_source=google_keyword&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=families_hub_launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://families.google?utm_source%3Dgoogle_keyword%26utm_medium%3DBlog%26utm_campaign%3Dfamilies_hub_launch&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615931805982000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGR2Ob30dbH_1roYRzaLjbh0dKmbA">families.google</a>). The company also launched a new content series with meditation app Headspace that will help families with kids practice mindfulness together. Again, that&#8217;s a resource that was desperately needed in 2020 during the pandemic&#8217;s heights, more so than it is today as the world begins reopening.</p>

<p>Still, the pandemic has forced families to think more about screen time and what sort of on-device experiences they want their children to have. As a result of this increased scrutiny, social apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">Instagram</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">the latter just today</a>, in fact &#8212; have rolled out more family-friendly safety features, aimed at encouraging parents to see their apps in a better light, rather than being the first to go when screen time gets locked down. It has also encouraged new hybrid learning and education startups to launch, hoping to build out a new category of edutainment apps that can avoid screen-time lockdowns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, too, that the update to Family Link follows the addition of an App Store privacy label on iOS, which confirms the data Google collects on users. The app, until recently, had been one of the many Google iOS apps that had seen updates stalled due to the lack of labeling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security breach at cryptocurrency platform Roll allowed a hacker to obtain the private key to its hot wallet and steal its contents — worth about $5.7 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company <a href="https://tryroll.com/security-incident/">said</a> it was investigating the breach, which happened early Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As of this writing, it seems like a compromise of the private keys [sic] of our hot wallet and not a bug in the Roll smart contracts or any token contracts,&#8221; the statement said. Roll said the attacker had already sold the tokens for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no further user action suggested at this stage. We are temporarily disabling withdraw from the Roll wallet of all social money until we have migrated our hot wallet,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how the attacker broke in and obtained the private key — akin to the password for Roll&#8217;s hot wallet. Hot wallets are designed to be connected to the internet to send and receive cryptocurrency, but typically only store a fraction of a cryptocurrency owner&#8217;s total reserves, given the inherent security risk of an internet-connected wallet. A cold wallet, or storage device that isn&#8217;t connected to the internet, is typically used for holding the bulk of an owner&#8217;s cryptocurrency for longer-term periods.</p>
<p>Roll allows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">creators to mint and distribute</a> their own Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, known as social tokens, under which the creators can decide how the currency is spent. There are hundreds of different kinds of social currency on the platform, including $WHALE, $RARE and $PICA tokens — which plummeted in value in the aftermath of the breach.</p>

<p>The creator of the $WHALE token said <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1371032207838437376">in a tweet</a> more than 2% of its tokens were stolen in the Roll breach, but that the hack was &#8220;minimally detrimental&#8221; to the project.</p>
<p>Others weren&#8217;t so lucky. One person said <a href="https://twitter.com/HacquardMaxime/status/1371246050611200003">they had &#8220;lost everything,&#8221;</a> while others criticized for not going far enough Roll&#8217;s new $500,000 fund to help affected creators.</p>
<p>Roll said it will hire a third-party to audit its security infrastructure to prevent another breach. &#8220;We will also run a forensic analysis to figure out how the key was compromised,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jennifer Dulski has held her fair share of leadership positions, from being president and COO of Change.org to serving as head of product for Google&#8217;s shopping and product ads to leading the team responsible for Facebook Groups.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s identified a problem that most people managers will all too clearly understand: training and tools to be a great manager are at a shortage.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why she founded <a href="https://risingteam.com/">Rising Team</a>, which is today announcing the raise of a $3 million seed round led by Female Founders Fund, with participation from Peterson Ventures, Burst Capital, Xoogler Ventures, 500 Startups, Roble Ventures, Supernode Ventures and several angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dulski explained that there are some tools for managers, like surveys from Gallup and Glint, and there are training options, like executive coaches. But there aren&#8217;t many options out there that combine the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lucky enough to have the benefit of getting executive coaches or being sent to training, and those felt like being taught how to fish,&#8221; said Dulski. &#8220;But then it was like being dropped off at the lake with no fishing pole or bait, because I had learned all these things about how to be a good leader but I had no tools to implement what I had learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rising Team is a platform that combines tools and training to help managers motivate, organize and ultimately effectively lead their team.</p>
<p>The first layer of the platform is the tools suite, which includes proprietary assessments and 1:1 templates. Most employee surveys focus so heavily on the actual job, with questions about where employees can do their best work. With Rising Team, the assessments are geared toward who team members are personally, with a look at how they want to be appreciated or what they believe their talents and skills are.</p>
<p>This helps managers understand how to pair team members together, what tasks they should be assigned to and truly grasp what motivates each individual that works for them. Alongside these assessment tools, Rising Team also offers training in the form of videos, articles and audio resources. In the future, the company plans to add AI-based custom training tips that are powered by data from the assessments.</p>
<p>Rising Team is also building out a community that lets managers communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the startup is taking a bottom-up approach when it comes to revenue, pricing the product in a way that will allow individual managers to personally purchase the software, hopefully spreading the word to the rest of their team. But the door is open for organizations to get their full employee base on the product as well.</p>
<p>For now, Rising Team is in a free beta, so pricing has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The team is currently made up of eight people, 60% of whom are female and 50% of whom are BIPOC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really, really important to me and to our team as a whole that we build a diverse team from the start,&#8221; said Dulski. &#8220;I believe in that so firmly and all the data is really clear that more diverse teams are more successful.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A growing number of companies are revolutionizing the way farm and forestland is acquired, developed and commercialized across the United States.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jim Jackson developed timber and farmland in Eastern Washington, protected from coastal rains by the peaks of the Cascade mountains, building out a clutch of apple farms and other properties on the state&#8217;s sunny side for 40 years.</p>
<p>Traditionally, he raised money to expand operations for his farms through his existing network, which meant asking previous investors to pool together and come up with the cash.</p>
<p>But more recently, Jackson turned to a fundraising platform that operates entirely online. Like hundreds of other farmers, he&#8217;s using a service called <a href="https://www.acretrader.com/">AcreTrader</a> to raise money for agricultural development projects. AcreTrader is one of a growing number of companies revolutionizing the way farm and forestland are acquired, developed and commercialized across the United States.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of farmland in the U.S. Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and the world&#8217;s third-richest man, is the nation&#8217;s largest owner of farmland, holding <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-is-now-the-largest-farmland-owner-in-america-11610818582">roughly 242,000 acres</a>. That number seems high until you compare it with the <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/number-of-us-farms-down-3-percent-in-five-years">897.4 million acres</a> of land that are currently arable and used for farming in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, TikTok made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">update to its privacy settings</a> and defaults to further lock down the app for its teenage users. This morning, Instagram followed suit with teen-focused privacy updates of its own. But the Facebook-owned social app didn&#8217;t choose to add more privacy to teen accounts by default, as TikTok did &#8212; it largely made it more difficult for adults to interact with the app&#8217;s teen users.</p>
<p>The company said it&#8217;s rolling out new safety features that would restrict adult users from being able to contact teens who didn&#8217;t already follow them. The exception to this rule would still allow the teen to interact with adult family members and other trusted adults on the platform, like family friends. In the case that an adult tried to DM a teen who didn&#8217;t follow them, they&#8217;d receive a notification informing them this wasn&#8217;t possible.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How TikTok decides who to make famous&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/how-tiktok-decides-who-to-make-famous/embed/#?secret=rdPKdcNWZn" data-secret="rdPKdcNWZn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And if the teen has already connected with an adult and is DM&#8217;ing with them, they&#8217;ll be notified if that adult is exhibiting suspicious behavior &#8212; like sending a large amount of friend requests or messages to users under 18. This tool will also then allow the teen to end the conversation, block, report or restrict the adult from further contact.</p>

<p>In addition, Instagram said it will make it more difficult for adults to find and follow teens in other places within the Instagram app, including Explore, Reels and more. This will include restricting adults from seeing teen accounts in the &#8220;Suggested Users&#8221; section of the app, as well as hiding their comments on public posts.</p>
<p>The company also noted it&#8217;s developing new AI and machine learning-based technology that would make it possible to find teens lying about their age on the app. This could result in these features being applied, even if the teen in question had lied about their birth date when signing up for the app, but the technology isn&#8217;t fully live yet.</p>
<p>Other additions rolling out as part of today&#8217;s updates include new safety resources for parents in the app&#8217;s Parents&#8217; Guide and educational material for teens that will better explain what it means to have a public account on the app, and encourage them to choose private options.</p>

<p>The launch timing here is notable, as TikTok has recently focused on making its platform safer for teens &#8212; not only with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">changes</a> to its default settings, but also with the addition of parental controls last year. The company last year took the unusual step of bundling a parental control mechanism directly into its app that lets a parent link to a child&#8217;s TikTok account to control their profile&#8217;s privacy, what they&#8217;re allowed to do on the app and even which feed they can view. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy/">has continued to expand</a> these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">controls</a> following their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/tiktok-introduces-parental-controls-with-new-family-safety-mode-feature-launching-first-in-u-k/">launch</a>, indicating that it considers these core features. By making privacy and parental controls a key part of the experience, the app is more likely to be blessed by parents who would otherwise restrict their teens&#8217; social media access &#8212; and that helps TikTok grow its user base and teens&#8217; time spent in the app, sometimes at Instagram&#8217;s expense.</p>
