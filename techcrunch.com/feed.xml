										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has held discussions to invest over $50 million in Indian social commerce startup Meesho, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/">recently secured $570 million in a financing round</a>, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Android-maker, which has backed over half a dozen startups in India, has yet to make the investment in Meesho, according to another person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Meesho — which counts Facebook, B Capital, SoftBank, Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors — operates a three-sided marketplace that connects suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and resellers with customers on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. The resellers buy listed products from the suppliers and make commission on each transaction when they sell to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>About 80% of resellers on the platform are women. From the beginning, the startup has aimed to help women start their business without need for any capital. The startup, which like many other e-commerce firms was severely hit by the pandemic last year, has fully recovered and achieved an all-time peak growth in recent months.</p>
<p>Meesho&#8217;s recent fast-growth has been a topic of several serious discussions at Flipkart, India&#8217;s largest e-commerce firm, according to two people who work at the firm&#8217;s recently launched social commerce effort.</p>
<p>As of April this year, 13 million entrepreneurs and more than 100,000 suppliers were using Meesho, the startup&#8217;s founder Vidit Aatrey told TechCrunch in an interview last month, adding that the startup had since “grown 3x.”</p>
<p>At stake is the world’s second-largest internet market, where e-commerce has hardly made any dent to the overall retail. Just the social commerce market is expected to be worth up to $20 billion in value by 2025, up from about $1 billion to $1.5 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein said last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Social commerce has the ability to empower more than 40 million small entrepreneurs across India. Today, 85% of sellers using social commerce are small, offline-oriented retailers who use social channels to open up new growth opportunities,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Google, which has committed to invest $10 billion in 1India in the next couple of years, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>. YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">acquired social commerce startup SimSim in July this year</a>. Earlier this month, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-and-temasek-back-indian-neobank-open-in-100-million-fundraise/">backed Bangalore-based neobanking startup Open</a>.</p>
<p>Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/21/the-station-doordash-snags-400m-bolt-mobility-deploys-self-cleaning-tech-and-disappearing-jump-bikes/">Bolt Mobility</a>, a micromobility <a href="https://www.micromobility.com/">company</a> co-founded by Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, has launched an in-app navigation system for its e-scooters dubbed &#8220;MobilityOS.&#8221; To make this feature easy to use, Bolt&#8217;s next generation of scooters, the &#8220;Bolt Two,&#8221; allows a rider&#8217;s smartphone to be mounted to, and charged by, the scooter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The simple act of adding a phone mount to a scooter along with this in-app navigation is a differentiator in the shared scooter market. Not many shared e-scooters include phone mounts, a shocking oversight considering that it&#8217;s 2021 and most people who ride scooters likely outsource their navigation to Google Maps or Apple Maps. That said, some operators told TechCrunch giving distraction-prone riders a screen to look at when approaching intersections is a safety risk, not to mention the probable costs associated with having to fix or replace mounts that get damaged on the tough city streets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bolt&#8217;s MobilityOS uses map visualization provided by Google Maps, but the navigation system is built in-house to incorporate city-specific geofences for each unique ride, which helps keep riders on streets with bike lanes away from dangerous, sensitive or high-traffic areas. Spin&#8217;s app has a similar feature. Bolt says its system also encourages users to park vehicles safely and keep sidewalks clean with &#8220;reward parking zones.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The mount on the Bolt Twos is also a built-in wireless smartphone charger that&#8217;s powered by the scooter&#8217;s swappable batteries. The impact on the scooter battery of charging a smartphone is &#8220;minimal,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bolt is currently present in 33 cities, towns and campuses across the United States. MobilityOS and the Bolt Twos are already live in Miami, the company&#8217;s hometown, but the navigation system will arrive in Bolt&#8217;s other markets in the first quarter of next year. The new scooters will arrive into new markets, which Bolt hasn&#8217;t yet announced, and into existing markets as older fleets are updated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of what the competition offers, Voi, which mainly operates in Europe, does have a phone mount, but most of the others, including Veo, Spin, Lime and Bird, don&#8217;t. Superpedestrian and Veo say they&#8217;re working on getting phone holders on their fleets now, and Lime is piloting them on its Gen4 Scooter in Stockholm before making a decision about rolling them out globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lime, Spin and Bird are integrated with Google Maps, so users can both find e-scooters and route vehicle-specific trips on the app. However, without a mount, most users will probably just end up using headphones to listen out for directions while keeping their phone safely tucked away in a pocket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-growing fintech </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $300 million in funding that propels it to decacorn status, just six months after it was valued at $7.4 billion, according to people familiar with the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sources, who wished to remain anonymous since the deal is not yet public (although a term sheet has been signed), said corporate spend startup Brex is now valued at $12.3 billion. Greenoaks is said to be leading the investment, which also reportedly includes return backers who want more of a stake in the company after seeing the “strength” of the business. Brex is on track to double revenue this year, according to the sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Brex nor Greenoaks responded to requests for comment.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by </span><span class="s1">Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras (who are now in their mid-20s),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> San Francisco-based Brex was valued at $7.4 billion this April after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $425 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global Management. The company had raised $1.2 billion in debt and equity financing, according to Crunchbase </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With its latest infusion, that number climbs to $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Brex is now a decacorn is somewhat remarkable, given its relatively young age. As mentioned above, it&#8217;s now on track to double revenue in 2021, although we don&#8217;t have any hard figures on hand. The company told TechCrunch at the time of its last raise that it was “onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.” Brex also said then that it grew its “total customer” figure by 80% in the first quarter of 2021, “with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corporate spend space has heated up in a major way over the past year. Spend management startup Ramp in August announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $300 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion. Brex is focused on earlier-stage startups as well as more established businesses, especially those in the mid-market category. Ramp tends to serve larger, more established companies. At the time of its raise, Ramp told TechCrunch that it had seen its revenue and transaction volume surge by 1,000% since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last week, TripActions revealed that a pandemic pivot to helping enterprises with corporate expenses helped boost its revenue and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lift its valuation to $7.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it too now has unexpectedly emerged as a competitor in the corporate spend race. CEO Ariel Cohen told TechCrunch that he believes TripActions differs from Brex and Ramp in that the two startups “are disparate from travel” and thus focus more on SMEs while TripActions is more focused on enterprise companies. Interestingly, Greenoaks led that company’s recent $275 million round, as well.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brex, too, continues to evolve its model. Earlier today, the startup announced its new &#8220;<a href="https://www.brex.com/product/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brex API</a>.&#8221; The new open API is available to all Brex customers for no extra charge, it said, and is designed to allow them to &#8220;seamlessly manage financial information in a customizable interface.&#8221; For customers without in-house developers, Brex also announced a partnership with Zapier, which will allow the automation of workflows among products &#8220;without having to write a single line of code.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the Brex API, the company added, developers can build workflows that are customized for their company’s individual needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company announced it had put together a new service </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Brex Premium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs $49 per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of premium subscribers that we now have definitely blew away our expectations,” Dubugras told me in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Brex was the latest fintech </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to apply for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer, had submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in August, the company said it would </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/brex-will-withdraw-applications-for-industrial-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voluntarily withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its bank charter and federal deposit insurance applications in an effort to “modify and strengthen” its application before resubmitting at a later date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in August, Brex </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired one-year-old Weav,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a developer of a universal API for commerce platforms, for $50 million in its first significant acquisition. The move was aimed at giving the businesses which use its platform the ability to get financial services and new products “more quickly and precisely,” the company said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re standing at the water&#8217;s edge of the San Francisco Bay, chances are that you have half a dozen high-speed internet providers clamoring for your attention, eager to give you gigabits of internet. That isn&#8217;t the case for billions of people in rural communities around the world, who often have to make do with sub-par &#8212; if any &#8212; service. That&#8217;s the market <a href="https://meshplusplus.com/">Mesh++</a> is aiming to serve, and the company just snagged a couple of sacks of cash to help them realize its mission. Headquartered in Chicago and Nairobi, the team is focused on bringing internet connectivity to rural and underserved communities.</p>
<p>On paper, the solution is elegant. You plug a wireless router into power, and the router looks for other nearby Mesh++ routers. They connect and share any available internet connectivity across the mesh network. Each router becomes a node, further spreading the Wi-Fi love across the land. The company claims a single node can blanket 10 acres of Wi-Fi connectivity, supporting up to 100 people. If a local internet connection goes down due to connectivity or power failure, the rest of the network picks up the slack &#8212; and if there&#8217;s a full breakdown, the network can be used for internal communication, including messaging and news alerts within the network.</p>
<p>The internet connection can come from anywhere &#8212; whether via ethernet, via cellular modems, via multiple points &#8212; you have a set of Ethernet or cellular modems, throughout the network, and you&#8217;re able to aggregate the bandwidth from all those sources. So that creates a redundant network where if one of those fails the others can fill in. The cool thing about that, versus having a set of separate networks that are all fed separately, is that it creates a very trusted network where, for example, you might be deploying a fiber network in a very old city where the fiber infrastructure is already starting to fail. And having a network like this, that can aggregate the sources, means you can trust a normally untrusted source, because if it fails, nothing really major happens. So, we can create very resilient networks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to routine connectivity when everything is working as planned, the network should be able to survive disaster situations. This was tested a couple of years ago, when Hurricane Ida knocked out a huge swathe of connectivity across New Orleans; the company claims its network continued without any downtime.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no shortage of plays for rural and remote internet connectivity, but I&#8217;m struck by how Mesh++&#8217;s solution is coming at the challenge from a place of access and equality. It is certainly more equalitarian than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/elon-musk-says-starlink-internet-private-beta-to-begin-in-roughly-three-months-public-beta-in-six/">Elon Musk&#8217;s Starlink</a>, to pick an example out of outer space, but at the same time it is easy to imagine a combination of Starlink for internet gateway purposes and Mesh++ for the local distribution of rural internet connectivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of companies out there who can give you gigabit internet connections anywhere in the world,&#8221; says Mesh++&#8217;s CEO Danny Gardner, suggesting that Starlink may, in fact, be a good fit. &#8220;It would be a dream partnership. The challenge that a lot of these companies face, is that you can, in theory, serve a few hundred people per satellite, and the last-mile internet connectivity is the challenge. For them, partnering with a technology like ours that can get connectivity to anywhere, we will be able to connect the world&#8217;s remaining 3 billion people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is betting that it can out-execute even the big cellular data providers, and the team seems pretty unfazed by the competition offered by LTE or 5G networks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Look, T-Mobile promised to cover most of the U.S. with sub 6 Ghz 5G connectivity. But the truth is that if they haven&#8217;t covered it yet with 4G because they determined that wasn&#8217;t financially sustainable, then it&#8217;s not gonna happen with 5G either,&#8221; Gardner surmises.</p>
<p>In addition to having built out test networks in a number of American cities, the company has a presence in Nairobi, with a five-person subsidiary there.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first started the company, it was primarily geared towards emerging markets and the need for internet access,&#8221; says Gardner. &#8220;At first, we didn&#8217;t realize how big of a problem it is here at home in the U.S. Slowly over time, we shifted more towards fixing the connectivity problems in our own backyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mesh++ has raised a $4.9 million seed led by impact investor <a href="https://www.worldwithin.org/">World Within</a>, with participation from new investors Lateral Capital, Anorak Ventures, First Leaf Capital and existing investors SOSV, GAN Ventures, TechNexus and Illinois Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundraising marks a major shift in the company, from a pure R&amp;D-driven company over the past few years, and towards focusing more on sales, and turning the company into a more mature organization,&#8221; says Gardner. &#8220;The fundraising unlocks us being able to partner with customers and distributors to connect as many people as possible, and to get the product out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is playing into the macro-economic trend of ensuring that every home in the U.S. can be covered by internet connections. There is lots of funding available for last-mile networks, especially in the U.S. &#8212; now over $80 billion in the last few years. That’s not enough for fiber to every home &#8212; the economics and logistics of that only works in areas with higher population densities. This is where mesh networks might just be the key. Mesh++ claims that its technology cuts the infrastructure cost for installation from more than $400 per household to $29 or thereabouts. The savings are primarily in the labor costs and ease of installation, rather than the cost of the hardware that needs to be installed on-site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an earnings call Thursday, Snap said that it failed to meet revenue expectations for its <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">third quarter</a>. Snap reported $1.07 billion in Q3 revenue, missing Wall Street&#8217;s hopes that the company would bring in $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The company notched 306 million daily active users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">up from the 293 million it reported in Q2</a>. That growth isn&#8217;t stratospheric, but it looks plenty healthy for a platform that risked falling out of relevance entirely not long ago.</p>
<p>Snapchat attributed the revenue miss to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s big iOS privacy change</a>, which put new restrictions in place for apps seeking to track user behavior beyond their own borders. On the call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel noted that the company was caught off guard by how disruptive the impact on advertiser tools proved to be. Without the wide view that many advertisers were accustomed to, they had to adapt to new, more restrained ways of measuring user behavior. &#8220;Those tools were essentially rendered blind,&#8221; Spiegel said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spiegel framed the dent in Snap&#8217;s business as temporary, noting that adapting to the new normal &#8220;just takes time&#8221; and the long-term impact from Apple&#8217;s ad changes remains to be seen. He also observed the role of broader pandemic market trends in Snap&#8217;s underperformance.</p>
<p>Snap isn&#8217;t the only ad business adjusting to the iOS changes, which are a huge boon for user privacy. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/facebook-stock-drops-after-company-warns-apples-privacy-changes-to-have-bigger-q3-impact/">Facebook also warned</a> that it expects to see a significant impact in Q3 due to Apple&#8217;s new policies, which dampened the company&#8217;s ability to target ads.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, most people <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">opt out of cross-platform tracking</a> that ad businesses like Snap and Facebook rely on when presented with the choice. Unlike Facebook&#8217;s leadership, Spiegel has consistently been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/snap-ceo-spiegel-says-apples-iphone-privacy-change-is-good-for-consumers.html">supportive of Apple&#8217;s decision</a> to build more privacy into its mobile operating system in spite of how those changes might affect Snap&#8217;s bottom line.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Zero trust&#8221; is certainly a buzzword that gets freely thrown around in cybersecurity. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But what does it actually mean? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Also, why is a zero trust security model and architecture being mandated by the government? What should organizations consider to ensure their success?</span></p>
<p>Let’s start off by agreeing on what zero trust is and is not. It’s not a product or tool — it’s a methodology and model that requires a shift in our approach to cybersecurity controls. The traditional castle and moat approach was based on an environment where users, applications and data were managed within a defined corporate network.</p>

			Let’s start off by agreeing on what zero trust is and is not. It’s not a product or tool — it’s a methodology and model that requires a shift in our approach to cybersecurity controls.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With cloud, IoT, BYOD and a mobile and remote workforce, many users, applications and data are now outside the traditional organizational boundary. As such, organizations are recognizing the need to shift their cybersecurity approach to a model that implicitly never trusts and always verifies.</p>
<p>Many organizations are only now beginning to look at zero trust and trying to figure out what it means to them. What’s the impact from a security and productivity perspective? How do we go about implementing this approach? What tools do we need? How will we afford this?</p>
<p>Shifting to a zero trust model is not about replacing the infrastructure wholesale. It’s more of an incremental journey of modernizing the IT and security environment. In a zero trust model, organizations can identify high-value assets and data within the network and ultimately protect this information beyond what traditional cybersecurity methods allowed, no matter where users, apps and data reside.</p>
<p>Maybe just as important is for this approach to enable the business by automating processes so that the security controls are essentially transparent to users. For example, single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to log in once to access all their authorized business applications, reducing friction and improving the user experience.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/">Say hello to the Trump social network:</a> </strong>Former U.S. President Donald Trump is finally making good on the rumors that he intends to launch a media company. Indeed, the twice-impeached erstwhile reality television show host intends to build not just a social network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">but also a video service and has plans to take on both Amazon and Microsoft</a>. And Stripe, for good measure.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/netflix-employees-stage-a-trans-solidarity-walkout-pose-list-of-demands/">Netflix employees walk out in solidarity with trans staff:</a> </strong>At the junction of streaming media, comedy and a changing national dialogue concerning our trans brothers and sisters sits Netflix, which aired a comedy special that some viewed as platformed hate speech. Spotify ran into related issues when it spent heavily to bring Joe Rogan’s podcast exclusively onto its network.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/"><strong>Google to reduce app store fees:</strong></a> The drumbeat of pricing changes among global application marketplaces picked up tempo this week, with Google announcing that it is “lowering commissions on all subscription-based businesses on the Google Play Store.” Apple has fought efforts by developers for more flexible App Store payment policies and lower take rates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off our startup coverage today, founder and operator group The Fund is putting together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/the-fund-raises-fund-with-focus-on-women-led-woman-founded-startups/">The Fund XX</a>, which TechCrunch reports will become a “community of women investors and entrepreneurs that will make pre-seed and seed-stage investments.” Something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll take a look at a triple threat of crypto stories, and then dig into a host of discrete startup news items:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nft-sci-fi-card-game-parallel-raises-at-500m-valuation-from-paradigm/"><strong>Crypto card game raises $50M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Have you ever wanted to build your own card or board game? Struggled to find investors, backers or even friends willing to listen to your plan? Stop what you are doing, put it on the Ethereum blockchain and collect a huge check. Parallel, a sci-fi card game based on the Ethereum blockchain, is now worth $500 million after its huge funding round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wants-to-scan-every-humans-eyeball-and-give-them-crypto-in-exchange/"><strong>Eyeballs for crypto?</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the trade that Sam Altman’s Worldcoin has on offer. It has a five-pound orb — literally called &#8220;The Orb&#8221; — that will scan your eyes and award you some of its currency. Worldcoin is a Layer 2 Ethereum project.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/a-nine-figure-fund-for-jpgs/"><strong>Of course NFT funds are a thing now:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Meta4 Capital is raising capital to buy and trade NFTs, TechCrunch reports. It’s looking to raise $100 million and will be “anchored by a16z,” according to our own reporting. The a16z connection makes sense — the investing group has long-backed Coinbase, which is getting into NFTs and also put capital into OpenSea, which is also in the NFT game. So the startup investor has a huge incentive to keep the NFT magic alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, the rest of the news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/airgarage-a-full-stack-parking-operator-raises-12-5m-in-round-led-by-a16z/"><strong>Vertical software for parking:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s what AirGarage is building, and it just raised $12.5 million for its efforts. The vertical software push brings targeted products to particular industries that may have lagged others in their digitization. Parking certainly fits that mold.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/socratic-nabs-3m-seed-to-build-data-driven-task-management-system-for-developers/"><strong>Socratic bags $3M for its developer-focused task management service:</strong></a> This is an old round, but the startup only disclosed the capital when it decided it was time to open up a public beta of its service. Which is now. Per TechCrunch reporting, the service “wants to give engineering executives more insight into what’s happening inside their organizations,” along with helping more rank-and-file staffers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/parker-conrads-rippling-is-now-valued-at-6-5-billion-more-than-zenefits-at-its-peak/"><strong>If at first you don’t succeed, do it all over again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Former Zenefits leader Parker Conrad’s next project, Rippling, is now worth $6.5 billion after raising fresh capital. In case you need a refresher on the Zenefits saga, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/sec-fines-zenefits-nearly-1-million-for-misleading-investors/">we got you</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/yummy-bags-18m-as-its-expands-delivery-app-across-latin-america/"><strong>Yummy nabs tasty $18M for LatAm deliveries:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The rapid pace of North American venture capital rounds that we’ve seen in recent quarters is hardly a local affair. Yummy raised $4 million earlier this year and is back now with even more capital. The Venezuelan company wants to expand in its region, which the new funds will help facilitate.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/germanys-flixmobility-acquires-greyhound-lines-the-iconic-u-s-bus-company-in-78m-deal/"><strong>FlixMobility buys Greyhound:</strong></a><strong> </strong>German busing startup FlixMobility has purchased the iconic — if unloved — U.S. busing company Greyhound. The operation doesn’t have a reputation for operating excellence in the United States. Perhaps it will get better with a new corporate parent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons from founders raising their first round in a bull market</h2>
<p>The tide is high for startup founders who are looking to raise their first round in October 2021.</p>
<p>But easy money can create special pressure for early-stage founders, according to Lightup.ai founder Manu Bansal.</p>
<p>“You can’t speed up GTM with more money. If valuations go up astronomically, I remind myself that I have to deliver performance,” he says.</p>
<p>“If I cannot show traction, sooner or later this beast will come back to haunt me. I’d rather avoid the price runners.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/twitter-rolls-out-the-ability-for-anyone-to-host-a-space/"><strong>Now anyone can host a Twitter Space:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Twitter’s audio chatroom product was previously limited to folks with at least 600 followers. That requirement has been axed.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/surface-duo-2-review-getting-better/"><strong>Microsoft’s dual-screen smartphone thingy is getting better:</strong></a> If you are familiar with the first generation Surface Duo, the good news is that the second edition is much better. The bad news is that we don’t think that it is fully baked as of yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/facebook-messenger-is-adding-new-ar-experiences-for-group-video-calls/"><strong>Something something metaverse?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Recall that Facebook wants to be a metaverse company now, right? Well, it’s directionally aligned that the social media giant is now “rolling out new augmented reality (AR) experiences to video calls and Messenger Rooms,” given its self-made plans for the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/unity-launches-unity-gaming-services-to-simplify-development-of-cross-platform-multiplayer-games/"><strong>Unity wants to make it easier to create cross-platform games:</strong></a> Akin to how a family might wind up with all iOS or all Android devices, gamer groups can form around console selection. Unity’s new Unity Gaming Services product may make it easier for devs to build cross-platform games. Something that we PC gamers would be just fine with.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/apple-will-require-unvaccinated-employees-to-test-for-covid-19-daily/"><strong>Why not just have a vaccine mandate?</strong></a> Apple will require non-vaccinated employees to be tested for COVID-19 daily, which seems very much like a faff to get folks to get vaccinated without telling them to. Which it effectively is.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"><strong>EU considers banning “creepy” ads:</strong></a><strong> </strong>According to our own Natasha Lomas, “European Union lawmakers are mobilizing support for a ban on tracking-based advertising.” Given how popular that particular form of advertisement has proven, this is big news.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> has been in the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">a strategy shift</a> with a focus on hybrid cloud and AI since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/">Arvind Krishna was promoted</a> to CEO in last year. Red Hat, the software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-red-hat-acquisition-for-34-billion/">it purchased for $34 billion</a> in 2018 has been at the center of it all. With the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/IBM-3Q21-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">company reporting earnings</a> yesterday, the financial performance was pretty bleak, but at least <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> continues to grow at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Overall the company announced revenue of $17.62 billion for the quarter, which came in below analysts&#8217; expectations of $17.77 billion, according <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/ibm-earnings-q3-2021.html">to a CNBC report</a>. On the bright side, it grew at a very modest 0.3% year over year. That may not sound like much, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/ibm-snaps-out-of-revenue-doldrums-breaking-a-five-quarter-losing-streak-in-q4/">positive revenue has been hard</a> to come by for Big Blue in the last decade.</p>
<p>As for the cloud and cognitive software business unit that includes Red Hat, that was up 2.5% to $5.69 billion. At the earnings meeting with analysts after the report hit, CFO Jim Kavanaugh indicated that Red Hat grew 17% for the quarter. &#8220;Red Hat revenue growth was driven by double-digit growth in both infrastructure and application development and emerging technology. And we had more than 40% growth in OpenShift recurring revenue,&#8221; he said, referring to the company&#8217;s container orchestration platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222235" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That was the good news. The bad news is that they need to hire technical talent to keep up with demand and that talent is getting more expensive and cutting into their margins. &#8220;With a competitive labor market, this is putting some pressure on our labor costs, including higher acquisition and retention costs, which is not yet reflected in our current pricing. We expect to capture this value in future engagements, but it will take time to appear in our margin profile,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So Red Hat isn&#8217;t the problem, but IBM needs to find ways to squeeze more from its centerpiece company. Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says that the company needs to grow Red Hat further by doing a better job of convincing the hybrid cloud market that it&#8217;s truly a neutral player and not looking to be merely selling IBM services.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM has not fully managed to position itself as the &#8216;Switzerland&#8217; for cloud by allowing enterprises to avoid lock-in by using RedHat. It is a valid offering but has not caught the minds of the CxOs out there,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spinning out its infrastructure services division</a> into a separate company as it announced last year. It&#8217;s seen as a move to solidify the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">around the cloud and AI strategy</a>, but there will be some financial pain from losing that revenue from the balance sheet when the deal becomes final next month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other key parts of the company such as global services was down 5%, while systems revenue was down a hefty 12%. Only global consulting was a bright spot, growing 12%.</p>
<p>IBM is making some progress here, however incrementally, but not enough and not quickly enough. The stock is getting hammered today, down 9.56% at market close. Stockholders clearly want to see more, and while Red Hat is leading the way, the rest of the company continues to lag, and investors aren&#8217;t happy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So Plaid now calls itself a payments company. It was only a matter of time, really.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the data and connectivity startup <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/building-a-partner-ecosystem-for-the-future-of-payments/">announced</a> a new <a href="https://plaid.com/plaid-payment-partner-ecosystem/">payments partner ecosystem</a> that will extend its existing payments infrastructure and make ACH bank transfers a more attractive alternative to credit card transactions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			But the big winners here are merchants, who now have a low-cost alternative to avoid credit card processing fees that cut into their margins.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Before today, most of Plaid’s payments activity centered around improving customer onboarding and account funding through its payment initiation service. But the launch of the payments ecosystem heralds a much deeper integration with the payment flow of its partners and what could be a fundamental reshaping of how certain transactions are made.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why they&#8217;re building the ecosystem and who stands to benefit from it.</p>
<h2>Building a new payments network</h2>
<p>This payments ecosystem is really the culmination of a number of moves the company has made over the years.</p>
<p>First, Plaid enabled data to be connected between fintech apps and financial institutions. It subsequently created an <a href="https://plaid.com/products/identity/">identity product</a> so customers could verify users are who they say they are. Then, it built a tool to <a href="https://plaid.com/products/balance/">check the balance of an account</a> to ensure it has sufficient funds to make a money transfer.</p>
<p>It also added a <a href="https://plaid.com/en-gb/products/payment-initiation/">payments initiation service</a> that leverages the other tools to help customers onboard new users and add funds to their accounts quicker. And finally, it built a tool to <a href="https://plaid.com/signal/">assess the risk of bank transfers</a> and minimize ACH returns.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has reached a multiyear agreement to pay French publishers for resharing their content on its platforms, it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/facebook-alliance-announce-news-partnership">announced today</a>.</p>
<p>The social media giant said the licensing agreement with the Alliance of national and regional newspapers &#8220;means that people on Facebook will be able to continue uploading and sharing news stories freely amongst their communities, whilst also ensuring that the copyright of our publishing partners is protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook declined to specify how much it&#8217;s paying for the arrangement with l’Alliance de la presse d&#8217;information générale (APIG) in France when we asked. But in a blog post trumpeting the deal it wrote: &#8220;After constructive negotiations, this solution will further our investment in the news industry, and strengthen the news experience for both people and publishers on Facebook.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The blog post also specifies that it will be investing &#8220;at least&#8221; a billion dollars to support media companies over the next three years &#8212; however that&#8217;s a collective pot not a France-only pot. So who is getting what exactly &#8212; and where &#8212; remains unclear.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s largesse in France is not voluntary: The development relates to EU law that was updated to reform digital copyright rules <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a> to, among other tweaks, extend neighboring rights to snippets of publishers’ content in response to criticism from the newspaper industry that adtech giants were freeloading off quality journalism that users of their platforms share.</p>
<p>France has been at the forefront of transposing the EU&#8217;s digital copyright reform into national law but the amended rules are set to apply across the bloc — so adtech giants like Facebook will need to strike multiple deals to cover the region. Hence that &#8220;at least&#8221; $1 billion pot.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">reached a deal</a> with news publishers in France at the start of this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However it quickly came under scrutiny by the country’s competition watchdog over how it had approached negotiations with publishers. And this summer the French authority <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">fined Google $592 million</a> for breaching an order related to the process — accusing it of failing to conduct good faith negotiations and withholding key information relevant to determine payments.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INdN4WL0bd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/embed/#?secret=INdN4WL0bd" data-secret="INdN4WL0bd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog was also unhappy that Google tried to unilaterally impose terms on publishers, seeking to push them to agree to a global news licensing product it has devised, called Publisher Curated News, rather than negotiate local terms, as the law requires.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if the authority’s aggressive enforcement against Google concentrated minds at Facebook to ink its own deal with French publishers &#8212; not least because the amount it’s paying for content re-sharing isn’t being disclosed &#8212; but it probably helped.</p>
<p>The French publishing alliance group who’s members have agreed to terms with Facebook said only that the deal would generate “significant financing,” particularly emphasizing the revenue uplift it would generate for its smallest members.</p>
<p>&#8220;This first step in the concrete implementation of neighboring rights shows that solidarity between publishers is key to efficiently defend their interests,&#8221; added Pierre Louette, chairman of the Alliance and CEO of Groupe Les Echos – Le Parisien, in a statement.</p>
<p>Also today, Facebook announced that it will be launching a French news service in January — which it said will give users “a dedicated space to access content from trusted and reputable news sources&#8221; — dialing up its efforts to showcase professional journalism on its platform as a direct result of legislation requiring it to pay for new reuse.</p>
<p>It’s a far cry from recent events in Australia &#8212; where, earlier this year, lawmakers were debating similar legislation related to paying for news content aggregation and reuse. And during that legislative push Facebook temporarily shut down news sharing in the county altogether — along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">a whole bunch of other bona fide information sources</a>, seemingly as a sort of &#8220;chaotic evil&#8221; lobbying strategy to try to scare the country&#8217;s lawmakers into abandoning the idea.</p>
<p>What actually happened, though, was Australian lawmakers went ahead and passed a news bargaining code that applies to Facebook and Google this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">February</a>.</p>
<p>And deals to pay for content reuse in Australia were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/australias-nine-entertainment-signs-content-deal-with-facebook-google-2021-05-31/">duly struck</a> between the pair and a number of publishers and broadcasters down under.</p>
<p>So the writing seems to be on the wall for adtech platforms getting a free pass to monetize attention generated by professional news content that&#8217;s passing over their platforms. As other countries outside the EU see Big Tech&#8217;s wallet being unlocked to pay for news reuse through changes to the law they will surely follow.</p>
<p>But as steady payments flow from tech giants to newsrooms &#8212; last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/"> Google also announced a $1 billion pot to pay for news licensing</a> &#8212; democracy watchers may have reason to be concerned about dominant internet platforms becoming a revenue source for a &#8220;free press.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook are certainly wasting no time milking the publicity opportunity &#8212; suddenly claiming their platforms can now be relied upon as sources of &#8220;trusted and reliable news.&#8221; (Instead of, y&#8217;know, the outrage-driving clickbait and disinformation they have so often been found amplifying for a profit.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with Alliance proves the benefits of a strong collaboration,&#8221; gushes Facebook&#8217;s blog post. &#8220;Likewise, we’ve been encouraged by the progress that’s been made elsewhere in Europe, and we hope for continued, constructive conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developments it points to on that front are the recent launch of Facebook News in Germany, with new partners including Axel Springer, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Handelsblatt and Tagesspiegel.</p>
<p>In the U.K., it also notes that it has entered into agreements with a number of publishers, including Conde Nast, The Economist, Guardian Media Group and Hearst.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the increase in attention on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues over the past few years, it’s easy for companies to assume that we’ve reached the crest of the ESG wave. However, we are only at the early stages — an ESG tsunami is headed toward Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The increased attention on ESG issues has been across a much broader spectrum than just companies in the technology sector. This has largely been driven by broader societal trends, such as the focus on climate change. However, the ESG wave at companies, particularly public companies, is being accelerated by demands by various investor classes (including pension funds as well as a younger generation of individual investors) to focus more attention on such issues.</p>
<p>As a result, institutions that are trying to attract capital from these investors, such as mutual funds, venture capital funds and hedge funds, must increase their focus on the ESG dimension to stay competitive.</p>
<p>While the increase in focus on ESG has been gradual over the past few years, the level of investor influence on ESG issues took a step function forward with successful campaigns by shareholder activists at energy companies during the spring of 2021, most prominently a prominent proxy contest led by Engine No. 1.</p>
<p>For the first time, investor pressure related to an ESG issue (in this case, climate change), directly led to substantial turnover in the board of a public company. Activist shareholders are tapping into new and powerful ESG themes as leverage in their activist campaigns to change control and strategy at public companies.</p>
<h2>Is the technology sector next?</h2>
<p>Historically, the pattern of investor pressure on governance issues (the “G” in ESG) in public companies is to successively tackle issue after issue, winning on one issue and then moving on to the next. One good example of this is the migration of public companies to have annual elections for all directors for a one-year term rather than staggered elections of a portion of the directors for a three-year term — a so-called “classified board.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An institutional investor that overlooks an ESG-themed activism campaign may risk criticism for disregarding client priorities and even lose out on future investment from ESG-focused investors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2007, 55% of the U.S. incorporated public companies in the S&amp;P 1500 had a classified board. By 2021, after years of governance campaigns by shareholders, this was reduced to 26% of S&amp;P 1500 companies, with the classified board almost extinct at the largest public companies that comprise a larger percentage of investors&#8217; portfolio. Thus, from an investor perspective, the push to achieve annually elected boards is almost entirely resolved and the glare of the investor spotlight moves to focus on other issues.</p>
<p>We expect the same scenario to play out here. At a recent conference, Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager at CalSTRS and one of the architects of Engine No. 1’s proxy contest this spring, stated that she hopes the contest would serve as a wake-up call for all companies across all industries, not just for energy companies. So if targeting climate change in the energy sector was an obvious first choice, the question now becomes “Who’s next?”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you think of today’s internet landscape, Google’s overwhelming market share immediately comes to mind.</p>
<p>The latest reports show that Google accounts for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">nearly 87%</a> of the global search market, while Chrome makes up <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">over 67%</a> of the global browser market, touting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/543218/worldwide-internet-users-by-browser/">2.65 billion users worldwide</a>. As such, any startups creating online tools must consider themselves a partner of the tech giant in some capacity, but this market control also means that Google can leverage its browser dominance and change regulations as they please.</p>
<p>In fact, Google has woven certain restrictions on online startups into the fabric of Chrome for the past decade. Years ago, Google started enforcing a “single purpose extension” policy, requiring developers to limit their extension to one narrow focus or browser function.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More recently, Google has rolled out <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/">plans</a> for Manifest V3 — its new specification for building Chrome extensions that strives to improve security and privacy for users. Essentially, the Chrome Web Store will no longer accept new extensions built using the previous Manifest V2 guidelines starting in January 2022, and by the following year, any and all existing programs that fail to comply with Manifest V3 regulations will shut down.</p>
<p>In this case, some startups are facing a life-or-death scenario — either spend the time and resources adapting their product to Manifest V3 or completely cease to exist within Chrome. Ghostery, my employer, is facing this challenge as acutely as any.</p>
<p>While these roadblocks may seem disheartening for some, Google is listening with open ears, eager to hear how this might impact individual players in the space. It even extended the rollout timeline in an effort to gather more developer insights, and startups should take full advantage of this delay to make their specific migration challenges known.</p>
<p>This Chrome update is just one example of how startups that are innovating online could have the rug pulled out from under them at any moment, and as such need to always allocate resources to both staying abreast of these policies and having the proper engineers on deck to navigate these granular changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nonetheless, having your core business hosted on the internet comes with undeniable benefits like widespread visibility, easy installation and access to an eager user base. If tech giants like Google are willing to work alongside startups on finding the best solution for all parties (and it certainly looks like they are), the onus is on smaller companies to take advantage of these open communication channels and advocate on behalf of their product offerings.</p>
<h2>Look to your network for support</h2>
<p>Luckily, each individual startup doesn’t have to face the shifting internet landscape alone. With a range of players working within the same ecosystem, companies have a vast network of related businesses to tap into for support and advice. Instead of feeling siloed into their own challenges, startups in the online space should feel united by the constant change that impacts all companies within that ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, we joined the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webextensions/">W3C group</a> for web extensions in the midst of navigating Manifest V3. In this community, we can share our use cases and collaborate with other impacted companies on adjusting our technologies to align with the latest guidelines. By pooling resources and engaging in this cross collaboration, we can troubleshoot early in the adapting process.</p>
<p>Whether it’s seeking out similar groups or even consulting your network of founders and business leaders directly, it’s vital to lean on the startup community in these transitory periods for both product and general business direction.</p>
<h2>Become adaptable in more ways than one</h2>
<p>In addition to proactively allocating resources for adapting your hero product, startups that are innovating online need to constantly reevaluate their product road map and look for unique opportunities to diversify their offerings.</p>
<p>No two years in the history of the internet are the same, but one thing that remains steady is the desire for individuals to have customization options within this ecosystem — nimble startups are primed to offer the latest and greatest solutions, from e-commerce tools to password protection systems, privacy suites and more.</p>
<p>For some companies, this could mean investing more time in product development outside Chrome and researching the capabilities that Firefox, Safari or other alternative browsers could provide. Because each tech giant has their own policies related to browser customization, startups could open themselves up to a whole new user base and build unique features that are compatible with distinct systems.</p>
<p>Startups can also expand into the mobile sector and experiment with how their online innovations could work within the iOS or Android landscape. Ultimately, having a product scope that extends across the various corners of our online life, from in-browser to mobile applications, will make your company resilient against the constant shifts of our online world, and it’s much easier to build this resiliency if diversification is a part of your business plan from the very beginning.</p>
<h2>Embrace the constant of change</h2>
<p>Even though startups creating online tools and programs are constantly challenged with policy changes, regulatory shifts and market demands, those that aren’t afraid to collaborate with Big Tech and pursue an adaptable product strategy will always find a way to continue on their path toward providing consumers with the best products and experiences possible.</p>
<p>Staying steadfast in your mission and being willing to modify your approach along the way will allow you to successfully innovate for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After steadily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">expanding</a> access over the course of the year, Twitter announced today its audio chatroom feature known as Twitter Spaces is now open to anyone who wants to host a Space across iOS and Android. Earlier this year, the company had limited access to hosting Spaces to accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">with at least 600 followers</a>, saying that it found these accounts would be more likely to have a good experience because they had an existing audience.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter says the option will be offered to all its mobile users on the Twitter app. Users are able to start their first Space by tapping on the Compose button &#8212; the button they would otherwise use to post a tweet, according to the graphic shared alongside today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">the time has arrived &#8212; we’re now rolling out the ability for everyone on iOS and Android to host a Space</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>if this is your first time hosting, welcome! here’s a refresher on how <a href="https://t.co/cLH8z0bocy">pic.twitter.com/cLH8z0bocy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1451239134798942208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter was earlier experimenting with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">giving Spaces its own tab in the app</a>, but that has not broadly rolled out and isn&#8217;t shown in the current image shared with the announcement. In fact, Twitter users who are in the beta test for another new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a> will instead see the Communities button in the center of their app&#8217;s navigation row. Twitter says the dedicated Spaces tab was recently extended to more people in English on iOS, but is not yet available on Android.</p>
<p>Twitter has been rapidly iterating on Spaces since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">launch into beta last year.</a> More recently, it added the ability for Spaces hosts to add up to two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers, allowing for larger events with more moderators. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">shut down</a> its Stories feature, called Fleets, this summer, which made Spaces the only product that appears in the top row of the Twitter mobile app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since announcing Spaces, a number of major platforms have launched their own audio networking products following the breakout social networking hit app Clubhouse, which became a popular pastime during the height of the pandemic. Now Spaces and Clubhouse compete with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, Reddit, Public.com and others.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For Manu Bansal, founder of <a href="https://www.lightup.ai/">Lightup.ai</a>, raising a seed round from a16z was not a very difficult journey. His previous company, Uhana, launched in 2016, was backed by NEA and had been acquired by VMWare in three years.</p>
<p>So he had demonstrated ability when it came to not just building a product, but building a company, attracting a team, generating revenues and most importantly, getting it to a good exit.</p>
<p>But a challenge came up in 2021 as he was raising the seed round — the venture funding market got white-hot. In 2016, total VC investments in the U.S. were about $80 billion. By 2020, the capital deployed had ballooned to $164 billion, according to PitchBook NVCA. By all means, 2021 will top this trend.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“A sophisticated investor does not follow a fad or measure your progress against generic templates.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">startups have never had it so good</a>. The list of superlatives describing this insane bull market is getting longer. Silicon Valley is the Walmart on Thanksgiving Day sale.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money fast, really fast. Ask Bansal, inundated by investors and ready to do a preemptive up round just three months after he closed his seed round.</p>
<p>But this can be a gotcha, he warns.</p>
<h2>The vicious preemptive trap</h2>
<p>As the supply of capital grows, competition heats up, especially for people like Bansal. The number of unsolicited inbounds grows, with each attempt to get the founders&#8217; attention getting more crazy. Often, the easiest way investors get the founders&#8217; attention is to pump up the valuation. Up round, anyone?</p>
<p>But the dark side of this market can become a vicious preemptive trap, a cycle where an A round happens too early and a B round follows within a few months and the C round is not far behind.</p>
<p>“A company&#8217;s metrics cannot move materially in such short spans. As one of my investors says, figuring out go-to-market (GTM) has time constants involved,” said Bansal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005822/en/Today-at-Amazon-Accelerate-Amazon-Launches-New-Local-Selling-Capabilities-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Grow-by-Reaching-More-Customers-in-Their-Area">rolling out</a> &#8220;Local Selling,&#8221; a set of services that allow local and regional retailers to offer both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers.</p>
<p>With this new option, sellers can offer in-store pickup for products and services to shoppers in specific ZIP codes. In some instances, customers will be able to purchase items from sellers for same-day pickup at the business’s local retail location.</p>
<p>Products that are available for pickup will have a &#8220;store pickup&#8221; tab on the item page. Once customers place an order, they’ll receive a notification when their item is ready for pickup. When the item is ready, customers will have a five-day pickup window to collect their orders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shoppers can also choose local delivery, which will be facilitated by the business itself. Once you select the &#8220;arranged delivery&#8221; option at checkout, the local retailer will contact you to schedule the exact date and time for the delivery. Some sellers may also offer installation services that you can add on top of your order.</p>
<p>Amazon Local Selling is now available from both national and local retailers, including Mavis Discount Tire, Sears Hometown Store, 4 Wheel Parts, Electronic Express, Best Buy, Appliance Connection, Mattress Warehouse, Beach Camera, Adorama, DataVision, Exclusive Furniture, World Wide Stereo, MODIA, Focus Camera and others. The company says Local Selling will expand later this year and during 2022, as sellers who are interested in joining the program are able to apply to do so starting today.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that many customers will opt for local pickup when given the choice. This new capability is an exciting way to help sellers reach and delight more customers with great products and convenience,” said Jim Adkins, the vice president of recreational and vocational categories at Amazon, in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Amazon previously tested in-store pickup options in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/amazon-launches-counter-in-store-pick-up-in-the-us-starting-with-100-rite-aid-locations/">&#8220;Counter,&#8221;</a> a service where Amazon shoppers could arrange to collect packages at retail locations. The service essentially saw the company partner with retailers to arrange pickup counters in their stores for orders placed online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With this latest launch, Amazon is clearly looking to get orders to customers faster by leveraging its third-party network and their physical stores. It’s a way for Amazon to keep customers on its own marketplace as opposed to retailers’ websites. The launch also comes at a time when curbside pickup options have increased since the start of the pandemic. Companies like Walmart and Target have offered the option for quite some time now, as Amazon is gearing up to further compete with big box stores and retailers with its newest offering. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Shopify offers merchants on its platform in-store pickup options so this could be an attempt to better compete with that as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If challenging the status quo was easy, we’d see a lot more of it. In the world of smartphones, this means daring to think outside the rectangle, a form factor that has been the default for more than a decade and a half. Slowly but surely amid stagnant smartphone sales, companies have been testing the water.</p>
<p>There have, in recent years, been a number of evolutionary dead ends. ZTE’s Axon M comes to mind. A valiant, if deeply flawed, attempt that was, for all intents and purposes, two smartphones stuck together. Samsung’s folding phones seemed destined for a similar fate early on.</p>
<p>After a few generations, the company has turned things around, even if longevity and mainstream implications of both the line and the category broadly are still something of a question. I can genuinely say, for instance, that I’ve enjoyed my time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It works as intended, isn’t overly unwieldy like many of its folding brethren and is honestly the first foldable device I would recommend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like Samsung, Microsoft has been well positioned to push the edges of the category. The company long ago abandoned hopes of being a mainstream mobile powerhouse. It’s not for lack of trying, of course. But not even its $7.2 billion Nokia acquisition could keep those dreams alive. Instead, the company found hardware solace in the Surface line, a modest success that has produced some genuinely compelling form factors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221719" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221719" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The first Surface Duo was born out of that line, which prided itself in thinking outside the standard PC/tablet form factor. At an event in October 2019, the company introduced the dual-screen Neo laptop and the smaller Duo, a dual-screen Android handset. The former never made it into production. In May, Microsoft confirmed the death of Windows 10X and, seemingly, hopes of the Neo along with it.</p>
<p>When the Duo launched last fall, it was one of the year’s most eagerly anticipated devices. Like ZTE, Microsoft circumvented the need for a foldable display by fusing two screens together with a hinge. With nearly a decade of Surface hardware under its belt, however, the company had clearly created a far more elegant solution. But like the Axon M before it, the original Duo largely disappointed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn’t a failure from a hardware perspective, exactly (though sales may tell a different story), but it was plagued with too many issues to come anywhere near justifying its $1,400 asking price. The lack of an external camera, buggy software and the decision not to include 5G were among the major pain points in a device loaded with pain points. First-generation products are going to be imperfect &#8212; that’s the plight of the early adopter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221725" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But when asking consumers to shell out that much money for a new device, there are certain levels of quality one anticipates &#8212; ones the original Duo failed to meet. Much to its credit, however, Microsoft listened. Obviously that doesn’t help those chosen few who purchased the original product, but the company is clearly committed to doing better by future customers. In that sense, the Surface Duo 2 is more than just an update to the original device &#8212; it’s an effort to correct some of its predecessor’s biggest mistakes.</p>
<p>You could make a fairly convincing argument that Microsoft would have saved itself a lot of heartache had the first Duo been closer to this new model. The addition of the Snapdragon 888 with 5G, a rear-facing triple camera setup, narrowing the gap between the dual-screens and the continued improvement of software are important steps in the right direction. But the Duo 2 is still far from the sort of device you can heartily recommend. The next couple of generations &#8212; should Microsoft continue to invest in the device &#8212; will determine whether the issues with the device are fundamental or something that simply required continued refinement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221724" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221724" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221724" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The software, which can still be buggy switching between displays, is likely the latter. Along with developing its own dual-screen software, Microsoft is utilizing much of the work Google has done with companies like Samsung to create a version of Android that works on foldables. Of course, developing for a foldable and a dual-screen form factor is not a perfect one-to-one. But given Microsoft’s immense resources, perfecting that experience is likely a matter of how much time and money it’s willing to invest &#8212; that, in turn, is a product of perceived interest in the device.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222004,2222005,2222007,2222008,2222009,2222010,2222011"]</p>
<p>Where the original Duo relied on an internal camera for shooting, the 2 now has three rear-facing cameras: a 12-megapixel wide, 12-megapixel telephoto and 16-megapixel ultra-wide. That certainly sounds good on the face of it &#8212; and it’s undoubtedly an improvement. But the camera app is barebones and the picture quality was consistently sub-par compared to significantly less expensive systems. The Duo struggled in mixed and low light more than one would hope on a $1,500 system in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft isn’t as invested in mobile photography as Samsung, Apple or Google. That certainly shows here, but it’s also something that can be improved upon in future generations. Ultimately, however, the camera leads us to one of the potentially fundamental issues with the device. Among the reasons the original Duo relied on an internal camera is a pragmatic issue of form factor: flipping the device open with the camera on one side and the second display serving as a viewfinder on the other.</p>
<p>The company has actually done a decent job working with the camera bump, so the rear of the displays sit together at a slight angle. But actually using the thing is a pain. It’s somewhat handy having the second screen to display the shots after they’re taken, but the process is unwieldy &#8212; more akin to attempting to photograph something using a tablet.</p>
<p>In spite of some seemingly unavoidable flaws like this, the Duo 2 is a nice piece of hardware, and the addition of features like Microsoft Pen support and dual-screen gaming, which arrived on the original Duo back in May, get the product closer to where it should be. Other nice touches like the Glance Bar, which shows glimpses of notifications in the gap between screens when the device is closed, demonstrate how Microsoft is continuing to work cleverly with the form factor it has. But with continued issues and an asking price of $1,500, any hope of the product becoming truly mainstream feel &#8212; at best &#8212; multiple generations away.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The climate measures in the budget reconciliation package now before the U.S. Congress could unlock an investment boom in clean energy, zero-carbon transportation and efficient manufacturing that would allow us, as a nation, to reverse the course of rising greenhouse gas emissions that threaten our future.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, ​​these investments will help the U.S. maintain its role as an economic leader in a global economy that prioritizes zero-carbon solutions. Oh, and investment creates jobs, lots of them.</p>
<p>After deadly floods in Louisiana, grid failures in Texas and devastating wildfires in California, who wouldn’t want strong steps to meet the climate crisis with impactful, 21st-century solutions?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For investors, the proposed federal investments for zero-carbon infrastructure, renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate innovations will provide the policy signals we and other investment firms need to confidently fund breakthrough technologies.</p>
<p>Once investors know that the government is serious about taking action to bring the economy into the 21st century and competing with nations already aggressively deploying these technologies, climate and tech investors will increase commitments in these areas.</p>
<p>For example, take transportation electrification. Transportation now emits a greater volume of greenhouse gases than any other U.S. sector, with carbon exhaust from cars, trucks, airlines and shipping adding up to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">29% of total U.S. emissions</a>. Despite the temporary reductions in travel-related emissions during the pandemic, transportation emissions were still climbing at last measure and are likely to keep growing. This should alarm us all.</p>
<p>But with the reconciliation bill’s tax incentives for purchasing electric vehicles making these cars much more affordable for Americans &#8212; up to a $12,500 credit if you buy an EV made in the U.S. &#8212; plus the bill’s incentives for manufacturing and deploying EV charging infrastructure, we’d see rapid adoption of clean electric transportation and a steep drop in transportation emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Couple the transportation incentives with the reconciliation package’s Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP), which encourages utilities to hasten their steady transition to clean energy &#8212; from a national average of 40% today to 80% by 2030 through incentive payments and penalties &#8212; we’d see a precipitous drop in overall emissions.</p>
<p>Transportation and electric power together currently account for more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. These provisions will spur a broad energy generation transition that can also power the EV cars, trucks and fleets of the future.</p>
<p>As investors, we view the budget reconciliation as a long-term catalyst for sustainable growth, and growth translates to jobs. The Economic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/iija-budget-reconciliation-jobs/">estimates</a> that the budget reconciliation provisions, on their own, could create up to 3.2 million new jobs per year. Through our existing investments, we have seen firsthand how infusions of capital, from both public and private sources, can stimulate job creation, from hourly wage positions all the way up to highly skilled engineering roles. The budget reconciliation will create economic opportunities for all.</p>
<p>There’s clearly a market for climate action: The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate <a href="https://newclimateeconomy.report/">found</a> that bold climate action globally could deliver $26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030. We need this funding to go as far and as fast as possible to avoid a global rise in temperatures of 1.5 degrees C, which experts collectively agree is the tipping point into catastrophic, irreversible climate change. Government policy can both signal and pave the way for broader private-sector investments, as it did decades before with pollution legislation.</p>
<p>And what will happen to these investment dollars if Congress does not pass the infrastructure and budget reconciliation packages? The cost of inaction is far higher than the costs outlined in the budget reconciliation legislation. The climate measures in the bill add up to $700 billion over a decade, or $70 billion a year.</p>
<p>Climate change-induced extreme weather disasters in the U.S. alone cost <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/">roughly $100 billion each year</a>. If measures are not passed, individual citizens will keep paying higher tax and energy bills. Meanwhile, investors will instead put money into companies and sectors in other geographies that are focused on next-generation renewable energy, EV charging and other technologies supported by policy and will look for clean infrastructure plays on other continents where their investment dollars go farther and create faster returns.</p>
<p>In a no-action scenario, the United States will face long-term negative consequences as its economic leadership fades and its OEMs and supply chains gradually lose their position as global leaders. The U.S., as a nation, will in turn lose the financial capacity to mitigate or respond to the devastating local impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>We have an urgent need to address the climate crisis now, with the public and private sectors each maximizing their tools to ensure long-term economic and environmental sustainability. The federal policy tools and opportunities are clear, and the private sector is ready to respond with investment capital.</p>
<p>We urge Congress to pass a budget reconciliation bill and allow its strong climate measures to reap benefits for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix employees staged a walkout yesterday in response to the company&#8217;s handling of a Dave Chappelle special that premiered on October 5. At the same time, Los Angeles-based trans activist Ashlee Marie Preston hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleeMPreston/status/1450151113978572800">rally in solidarity</a> with Netflix workers participating in the walkout. Netflix stars like Jonathan Van Ness of &#8220;Queer Eye&#8221; and Mason Alexander Park of &#8220;Cowboy Bebop&#8221; and &#8220;The Sandman&#8221; expressed their solidarity in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnbE18-r_i0">a video</a> made for the rally, alongside other Hollywood stars and trans advocates like Angelica Ross, Jameela Jamil, Kate Bornstein, Our Lady J, Sara Ramirez, Peppermint and Colton Haynes.</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>&#8220;We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that’s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within <span class="il">Netflix</span> and in our content,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The exact turnouts of the employee walkout and solidarity rally are unclear, but there was enough hype around the event that Preston <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVOTn2Gv4Uz/">preemptively moved it</a> to a location with more space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221200" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnbE18-r_i0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The employees who participated in the walkout want Netflix to &#8220;adopt measures to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,&#8221; they wrote in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout">a letter</a>. They want Netflix to address a list of demands in the categories of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction.</p>
<p>When it comes to content, the group wants Netflix to increase its funding of trans and non-binary talent, bring employee resource groups into conversations about potentially harmful content, hire more trans and non-binary content executives and revise internal procedures around commissioning and releasing sensitive works. In terms of employee relations and safety, they want Netflix to recruit trans people, especially BIPOC, for leadership roles, allow employees to remove themselves from previous promotional content like allyship and diversity videos, and eliminate references and imagery of transphobic titles and talent in the workplace. For harm reduction, they want Netflix to acknowledge the company&#8217;s harm in platforming transphobic content, add a disclaimer before transphobic titles, boost promotion for trans-affirming titles on the platform and suggest trans-affirming content alongside those flagged as anti-trans.</p>
<p>The demands do not include removing the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22722357/dave-chappelle-the-closer-netflix-backlash-controversy-transphobic">controversial</a> Dave Chappelle special from Netflix, which sparked backlash from some employees and Netflix subscribers concerned with the company&#8217;s platforming of transphobic speech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-walkout-1235033910/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn&#8217;t say whether he would meet the group&#8217;s demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last couple of days, it’s been just listening to folks and hearing out how they’re feeling and what they’d like. I want to say that we are deeply committed to inclusion on screen and behind the camera and in our workplace,&#8221; Sarandos told the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He seemed doubtful that he would meet their demand to add a disclaimer about transphobia before Chapelle&#8217;s special.</p>
<p>&#8220;The content is age-restricted already for language, and Dave himself gives a very explicit warning at the beginning of the show, so I don’t think it would be appropriate in this case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Before Netflix released the Chappelle special, employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show — Chapelle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/07/dave-chappelle-transgender-netflix-special-backlash">declared</a> that he’s “Team TERF,” referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who oppose the movement for transgender rights. But Sarandos doubled down on his defense of the special, writing <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">an internal email</a> that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.” After receiving backlash, he later told The Hollywood Reporter, &#8220;I 100% believe that content on screen can have impact in the real world, positive and negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netflix Senior Software Engineer Terra Field, who is transgender, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the Chappelle special.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t complaining about &#8216;being offended,&#8217; and we don&#8217;t have &#8216;thin skin,'&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;What we object to is the harm of that content like this does to the trans community (especially trans people of color) and VERY specifically Black trans women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Field was later suspended, along with two other employees, for attempting to attend an online meeting of top executives, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-suspends-trans-employee-1235086394/">reports</a>. But she was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> after Netflix found that a director had shared a link to the meeting with her, implying that it was okay to attend.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Soon after, Netflix&#8217;s trans employee resource group began organizing a walkout. But B. Pagels-Minor, the organizer of the walkout and global lead of both the Black and Trans employee resource groups, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/netflix-fired-the-employee-who-organized-a-walkout-in-solidarity-with-trans-workers/">fired on Friday</a>. Their termination sparked more backlash against Netflix.</p>
<p>“We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” a Netflix representative told TechCrunch last week. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch was able to reach B. Pagels-Minor, but they did not offer a comment.</p>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on “The Closer” that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham’s recent comedy special “Inside” and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode “Squid Game,” Netflix’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that the employee admitted to sharing the content externally. But Pagels-Minor&#8217;s lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">told The New York Times</a> this week that “B. categorically denies leaking sensitive information to the press.” A former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation told TechCrunch that they highly doubt that Pagels-Minor leaked these documents, as they had both been critical of the leaks in public company chats.</p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that its internal access logs showed that only one person viewed sensitive data about the titles mentioned in the Bloomberg article.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android 12 is now officially available for Google&#8217;s Pixel phones and will slowly roll out to others in the coming months. Chances are, you think of Android as a consumer product, but over the course of the last few years, Google has put a lot of work into making it an enterprise tool, too. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that with the launch of Android 12, which already includes a number of <a href="https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/androidenterprise12/">new enterprise features by default</a>, Google is also now announcing a couple of new security-focused initiatives around <a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/">Android Enterprise</a>, too.</p>
<p>This includes a new bug bounty program, the aptly named <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">Android Enterprise Vulnerability Program</a>, which promises up to $250,000 for a full exploit of a Pixel device that runs Android Enterprise.</p>
<p>But Google is also working with its wider partner ecosystem to expand its support for the Zero Trust security model on Android. This means, for example, working with partners like Okta, Ping and ForgeRock to move their authentication workflows from WebView to Chrome <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/">Custom Tabs</a> on Android. Google has long argued that developers should use Custom Tabs whenever they render content from outside of their own domain, in part for performance reasons, but also because Chrome&#8217;s Safe Browsing features provide additional security.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;While WebView is a flexible and powerful component for rendering web content, Custom Tabs are more modern and full-featured, allowing identity providers to gather device trust signals, improve employee security and enable single-sign-on across apps and the web<span class="il">,&#8221; explains Rajeev Pathak, a senior product manager</span> at Google, in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google is also extending its Android Management API to make it easier for companies that use Enterprise Mobility Solutions from the likes of Microsoft, Citrix or Google itself to ensure that users &#8220;receive the fastest delivery of all of our enterprise features, with best practices and Android Enterprise Recommended requirements set by default.&#8221;</p>
