					<description><![CDATA[It's the software that can determine if a micromobility company breaks out of the rideshare model and into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of the shared, dockless micromobility model are numbered. That&#8217;s essentially the conclusion reached by Puneeth Meruva, an associate at Trucks Venture Capital who recently<a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance"> authored a detailed research brief on micromobility</a>. Meruva is of the opinion that the standard for permit-capped, dockless scooter-sharing is not sustainable — the overhead is too costly, the returns too low — and that the industry could splinter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because shared services have started a cultural transition, people are more open to buying their own e-bike or e-scooter,&#8221; Meruva told TechCrunch. &#8220;Fundamentally because of how much city regulation is involved in each of these trips, it could reasonably become a transportation utility that is very useful for the end consumer, but it just hasn’t proven itself to be a profitable line of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>As dockless e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds expand their footprint while consolidating under a few umbrella corporations, companies might develop or acquire the technology to streamline and reduce operational costs enough to achieve unit economics. One overlooked but massive factor in the micromobility space is the software that powers the vehicles — who owns it, if it&#8217;s made in-house, and how well it integrates with the rest of the tech stack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the software that can determine if a company breaks out of the ride-hailing model into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit, Meruva predicts.</p>
<p>Vehicle operating systems haven’t been top of mind for most companies in the short history of micromobility. The initial goal was making sure the hardware didn&#8217;t break down or burst into flames. When e-scooters came on the scene, they caused a ruckus: riders without helmets zipped through city streets and many vehicles ended up in ditches or blocking sidewalk accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/madrid-authorities-order-scooter-ban/">City officials were angry</a>, to say the least, and branded dockless modes of transport as a public nuisance. However, micromobility companies had to answer to their over-eager investors — the ones who missed out on the Uber and Lyft craze and threw millions at electric mobility, hoping for swift returns. What was a Bird or a Lime to do? The only thing <em>to</em> do: get back on that electric two-wheeler and start schmoozing cities.</p>
<h2>How the fight for cities indirectly improved vehicle software</h2>
<p>Shared, dockless operators are currently in a game of Survivor, fighting to get the last remaining city permits. But as the industry seeks a Business to Government (B2G) model that morphs into what companies think cities want, some are inadvertently producing vehicles that will evolve beyond functional toys and into more viable transportation alternatives.</p>
<p>The second wave of micromobility was marked by newer companies like Superpedestrian and Voi Technology. They learned from past industry mistakes and developed business strategies that include building onboard operating systems in-house. The goal? More control over rider behavior and better compliance with city regulations.</p>
<p>Most companies playing to win have begun to vertically integrate their tech stacks by developing or acquiring new technology. Lime, Bird, Superpedestrian, Spin and Voi all design their own vehicles and write their own fleet management software or other operational tools. Lime writes its own firmware, which sits directly on top of the vehicle hardware primitives and helps control things like motor controllers, batteries and connected lights and locks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We all know these constant video calls are doing <em>something</em> to our brains. How else could we get tired and frazzled from sitting around in our own home all day? Well, now Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research">done a little brain science</a> and found out that yeah, constant video calls do increase your stress and brain noise. Tell your boss!</p>
<p>The study had 14 people participate in eight half-hour video calls, divided into four a day — one day with 10-minute breaks between, and the other all in one block. The participants wore EEG caps: brain-monitoring gear that gives a general idea of types of activity in the old grey matter.</p>
<p>What they found is not particularly surprising, since we all have lived it for the last year (or more for already remote workers), but still important to show in testing. During the meeting block with no breaks, people showed higher levels of beta waves, which are associated with stress, anxiety and concentration. There were higher peaks and a higher average stress level, plus it increased slowly as time went on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taking 10-minute breaks kept stress readings lower on average and prevented them from rising. And they increased other measurements of positive engagement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141832" style="width: 931px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141832" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png" alt="Graph showing how breaks keep stress low during video calls." width="921" height="926" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png 921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft/Valerio Pellegrini</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly validating even if it seems obvious. And while EEG readings aren&#8217;t the most exact measurement of stress, they&#8217;re fairly reliable and better than a retrospective self-evaluation along the lines of &#8220;How stressed were you after the second meeting on a scale of 1-5?&#8221; And of course it wouldn&#8217;t be safe to take your laptop into an MRI machine. So while this evidence is helpful, we should be careful not to exaggerate it, or forget that the stress takes place in a complex and sometimes inequitable work environment.</p>
<p>For instance: <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/04/13/zoom-fatigue-worse-women/">A recent study published by Stanford</a> shows that &#8220;Zoom Fatigue,&#8221; as they call it (a mixed blessing for Zoom), is disproportionately suffered by women. More than twice as many women as men reported serious post-call exhaustion — perhaps because women&#8217;s meetings tend to run longer and they are less likely to take breaks between them. Add to that the increased focus on women&#8217;s appearance and it&#8217;s clear this is not a simple &#8220;no one likes video calls&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, has tech solutions to the problems in its Teams product, such as adding buffer time to make sure meetings don&#8217;t run right into each other, or the slightly weird &#8220;together mode&#8221; that puts everyone&#8217;s heads in a sort of lecture hall (the idea being it feels more natural).</p>
<p>Stanford has a few <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">recommendations</a>, such as giving yourself permission to do audio only for a while each day, position the camera far away and pace around (make sure you&#8217;re dressed), or just turn off the self-view.</p>
<p>Ultimately the solutions can&#8217;t be entirely individual, though — they need to be structural, and though we may be leaving the year of virtual meetings behind, there can be no doubt there will be more of them going forward. So employers and organizers need to be cognizant of these risks and create policies that mitigate them — don&#8217;t just add to employee responsibilities. If anyone asks, tell them science said so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be time for neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops to start thinking about a subscription business — at least according to a new Y Combinator-backed startup called <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/">Per Diem</a>. The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.3 million in seed funding led by Two Sigma Ventures.</p>
<p>As co-founder CEO Tomer Molovinsky put it, Per Diem helps local businesses &#8220;build their own Amazon Prime.&#8221; He said that he and his co-founder/CTO Doron Segal started working on this during the pandemic, as local businesses became more willing to consider new models to increase loyalty and regular purchases.</p>
<p>Not that this is an entirely new concept. In fact, Molovinsky said a number of the startup&#8217;s early customers already offered subscriptions of their own, like <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/national/normans-farm-market">Norman&#8217;s Farm Market</a> with its CSA subscription for produce, or <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/new-york/ixv-coffee">IVX Coffee</a> with a program initially focused on filling up reusable mugs with coffee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But apparently these programs were usually managed through spreadsheets or an &#8220;old-school Rolodex,&#8221; making them increasingly difficult to manage as they grew. So Per Diem has built software to handle things like ordering, pickups/deliveries and payments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141825" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="Per Diem" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Per Diem</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Today we offer support for both local delivery and shipping, and then we plan to build that out [with] different types of integrations, delivery partners and shipping partners,&#8221; Molovinsky said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re building on that core fundamental, which is that this is a brick-and-mortar business. That&#8217;s the ultimate differentiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Per Diem emphasizes creating a strong in-store experience for subscribers, since that&#8217;s where they build a real relationship with the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to build a future where … I&#8217;m getting all my food from warehouses in another state,&#8221; Segal added. &#8220;I want to be able to say, &#8216;Oh, I get my food from John, I get my coffee from Linda.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Diem says that after Norman&#8217;s Farm Market used the software to offer vegetable box subscription on its website, it sold over 500 subscriptions in the first month alone. And IVX is now able to offer a full menu of espresso, match and coffee (drip and bean) subscriptions, with the average subscriber visiting the store five days a week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141831" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141831" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Per Diem founders Doron Segal and Tomer Molovinsky" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141831" class="wp-caption-text">Per Diem founders Doron Segal and Tomer Molovinsky. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Per Diem</p></div></p>
<p>The startup is currently focused on New York, but it&#8217;s already working with businesses in Phoenix and Washington, D.C. as well, and Molovinsky said there are no real geographic limitations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he said he&#8217;s hoping to create &#8220;more value&#8221; for businesses, which could eventually mean cross-promoting different subscriptions or creating a neighborhood-wide subscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stay focused on what are the things we can unlock for [our customers],&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re struggling with email marketing, so we added tools like that into our system. Over time, we can build up our system to continue to strengthen the relationship between the customer and the business.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I’m a female entrepreneur who created my first startup a few months ago. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Once my startup gets off the ground — and as COVID-19 gets under control — I’d like to visit the United States to test the market and meet with investors. Which visas would allow me to do that? </strong></p>
<p><strong>—Noteworthy in Nairobi</strong></p>
<p>Dear Noteworthy,</p>
<p>Congratulations on founding your startup! There are many ways to engage with the U.S. startup ecosystem, and you can start now, even before you physically come to the United States.</p>
<p>I recommend doing some research into the programs and resources offered to entrepreneurs like you through the U.S. Embassy and Consulates near you in your home country. I recently interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillian-wahl-tuco-460a0548/">Lilly Wahl-Tuco</a>, a foreign service officer who has worked for the U.S. Department of State for 15 years, on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/067-diplomacy-through-supporting-entrepreneurs-with-lilly-wahl-tuco/">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco discussed some of the State Department resources &#8212; including programs, competitions and grants &#8212; made available by U.S. embassies and consulates for entrepreneurs living in the area.</p>

<p>Serving as the first <a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-office-of-policy-and-public-outreach/">Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH)</a> officer at the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015, Wahl-Tuco was tasked with energizing the entrepreneurs of Bosnia. After she traveled around the country, visiting every incubator and meeting several entrepreneurs, Wahl-Tuco said she was surprised that most of the people she talked with didn’t know about the resources that the U.S. government offers through its embassies.</p>
<p>She recommends that entrepreneurs reach out, network and do online research to figure out what’s offered in their country or even if other foreign embassies offer resources and programs aimed at entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco also suggested that entrepreneurs reach out to their local U.S. Embassy. For example, you can contact the <a href="https://ke.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Kenya</a> to find out if you can discuss your startup and business plan with an ESTH officer (if there is one) or someone else there. Connecting with embassy staff can open up many opportunities.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest hearing to target Big Tech will drill down on competition in Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play. The Senate hearing, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores">set for Wednesday at 2:30 p,m. EDT</a> and embedded below, will feature testimony from the two big app store gatekeepers, and three companies that have banded together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">to critique the immense power</a> that Apple and Google command in the mobile software market.</p>
<p>Last year, 13 app makers created the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/"> Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a group organizing against Apple in particular for its stranglehold over app distribution and the hefty fees it collects from software developers. The group is linked to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-17-coalition-for-app-fairness-behind-north-dakota-bill-against-apple">legislation in states like North Dakota</a> that seeks to make state laws more more favorable to software makers by removing app store fees and has expanded since its inception.</p>
<p>Spotify, Tile and Match Group (which owns Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps) are all members of the coalition and will be testifying in the Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing Wednesday. That committee is helmed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">an emerging antitrust hawk</a> who&#8217;s made reining in Big Tech&#8217;s power a cornerstone of her political brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No tech CEOs will be giving testimony this time around — they&#8217;ve sent legal counsel instead — but the dynamic might be interesting given that the two Big Tech companies will appear alongside their fierce critics, who are aligned with the lawmakers who called the hearing.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnCUmJvNIr0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The hearing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">a day after Apple launched AirTags</a>, its own Tile-like product that can geolocate lost items like keys and wallets. Tile has criticized Apple for more than a year over those plans, claiming the tech giant implemented policies to hamstring the market leader in a product category it planned to compete within. The company previously testified before the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">airing those concerns last January</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition,&#8221; Tile CEO C.J. Prober said Tuesday following Apple&#8217;s big event. &#8220;Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prober called lawmakers&#8217; interest in examining Apple&#8217;s policies &#8220;entirely appropriate&#8221; in light of Tile&#8217;s history of issues with the company.</p>
<p>Software makers have long been waging a battle against Apple over its iron grip on the app world. Last year, Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/">elevated that struggle</a>, picking a fight with Apple over the 30% cut the company takes on payments made through its App Store. Apple punished the company for its attempt at a workaround for the fees, kicking Epic&#8217;s hit game Fortnite out of the App Store and prompting Epic to launch an antitrust suit against the $2 trillion company. Epic&#8217;s day in court kicks off next month, on May 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Right on schedule, Google today launched the third developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">Android 12</a>, the latest version of its mobile operating system. According to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">roadmap</a>, this will be the last developer preview before Android 12 goes into beta, which is typically also when you&#8217;ll likely see the first over-the-air updates for nondevelopers who want to try it out. For now, developers still have to <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get">flash a device image</a> to their supported Pixel devices.</p>
<p>Google notes that with the beta phase coming up, now is the time for developers to start compatibility testing to make sure their apps are ready. Currently, the plan is for Android 12 to reach platform stability by August 2021. At that point, all the app-facing features will be locked in and finalized.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in this preview? As usual, there are dozens of smaller new features, tweaks and changes, but the highlights this time around are the ability for developers to provide new haptic feedback experiences in their apps and new app launch animations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new app launch experience may be the most noticeable change here for both developers and users. The new animation will take the app from launch to a splash screen that shows the app&#8217;s icon and then to the app itself. &#8220;The new experience brings standard design elements to every app launch, but we’ve also made it customizable so apps can maintain their unique branding,&#8221; Google explains. Developers will get quite a bit of leeway in how they want to <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreen">customize this splash screen</a> with their own branding. The most basic launch experience is enabled by default, though.</p>
<p>Rich haptic feedback is also new in this release. It&#8217;s hard not to look at this and think of Apple&#8217;s now mostly abandoned Force Touch, but this is a bit different. The idea here is to provide &#8220;immersive and delightful effects for gaming, and attentional haptics for productivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other new features in this release include a new call notification template that is meant to make it easier for users to manage incoming and ongoing calls. Google says these new notifications will be more visible and scannable. There are also improvements to the Neural Networks API for machine learning workloads and new APIs to support a wider range of ultra high-resolution camera sensors.</p>
<p>With Android 12, Google is also deprecating its RenderScript API for running computationally intensive tasks in favor of GPU compute frameworks like Vulkan and OpenGL.</p>
<p>You can find a full breakdown of all of the changes in this release <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are any number of seed rounds that cross our desks every day, a never-ending march of enterprise software, consumer apps, games, hardware, biotech and sometimes even a space startup. But amid the regular flow of funding news, it&#8217;s still rare to come across a company raising money to take on addiction with software. So when <a href="https://www.affecttherapeutics.com/">Affect&#8217;s</a> $1 million seed round from <a href="https://alleycorp.com/">AlleyCorp</a> came to my attention, I wanted to learn a bit more.</p>
<p>As someone who went to rehab for alcohol use disorder in what appeared to be a partially renovated middle school where the highest-tech thing that was in our group rooms were <em>chairs</em>, the idea of using software to help addicts reduce use and get their life back intrigued me.</p>
<p>Focused on stimulant abuse in particular, the startup wants to help people addicted to methamphetamine, for example, fully cease their use of the drug. Affect CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinmuhlner/">Kristin Muhlner</a> talked me through the company&#8217;s efforts during an interview. In short, the Affect app combines contingency management (<a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/evidence-based-approaches-to-drug-addiction-treatment/behavioral-therapies/contingency-management-interventions-motivational-incentives">rewards for positive behaviors</a>) and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897895/">a form of therapy with known impact on addiction</a>). Regarding the latter, Muhlner told TechCrunch during an interview that well-known recovery programs like <a href="https://aa.org/">AA</a> or <a href="https://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART Recovery</a> also use forms of CBT in their approaches to helping addicts.</p>
<p>In app form, those two concepts break down into things like cash rewards for multiday abstinence or attending a group session. On the therapy front, Affect offers group therapy, individual therapy, addiction counseling and drug testing.</p>
<p>Like many companies today, Affect intends to learn from more data; it expects, per a deck that TechCrunch was able to review, machine learning to help the company hone its model and service over time. Let&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>Critically, Affect is not opposed to medically assisted recovery, which matters. There is, in some recovery-focused theologies, a belief that any sort of medical assistance is akin to merely replacing one addiction, or substance, with another. This harmful view is <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment">contradicted by science</a>. So, to see Affect cite adjuvant medication in its own pitch materials was heartening.</p>
<p>Stimulant abuse is rampant in America, and meth addiction is among the <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">most deadly drugs in the country</a>. Meth is no fucking joke. The only good amount of meth usage is precisely and exactly zero meth usage. So what Affect is building could actually change the world for stimulant addicts if it works.</p>
<p>I honestly hope Affect company winds up raising a bit more to more fully test out its thesis regarding addiction recovery. With insurance companies picking up the tab for Affect&#8217;s software, it has a chance to reach lots of folks in need. So many, in fact, that when I asked its CEO how it was handling go-to-market work, she said that her company had been warned that her user group was hard to reach. However, after putting up a digital ad, her company had to take it down seven minutes later. How&#8217;s that for product-market fit.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope we see more startups working on this problem. Addiction is not going away and older methods are not the only way forward for addicts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/figma/">Figma</a> spent years in stealth before launching its web-based collaborative design tool. Since coming into the light, the company has been iterating quickly. Today, Figma launches its biggest product update to date.</p>
<p>Meet FigJam, Figma&#8217;s new whiteboarding tool.</p>
<p>The entire concept of Figma stemmed from the fact that designers were taking up much more space at the figurative table and needed a place to collaborate efficiently. That is only more true today, especially during the last year of working from home, which is why Figma is extending itself throughout the workflow of designers with whiteboarding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only does FigJam give designers a place to come up with ideas together, but it also gives nondesigners a place to participate in the brainstorm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma raises $50 million Series D led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/embed/#?secret=ETCxV3zGIz" data-secret="ETCxV3zGIz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>FigJam functionality includes sticky notes, emojis and drawing tools, as well as shapes, pre-built lines and connectors, stamps and cursor chats. As expected, FigJam works with Figma so components or other design objects breathed into life on FigJam can easily be moved into Figma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our point of view here was focusing on how to make FigJam work as the first step in the design process, before you go into actually doing design work,&#8221; said Figma founder and CEO Dylan Field. &#8220;We see people looking for a better, more fluid experience, but we also wanted to make it simple enough to bring other people into the tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take that a step further, Figma is also introducing voice chat into all of its products. That means users who are designing alongside one another in Figma or brainstorming in FigJam don&#8217;t need to hop into a separate Zoom call or Google Meet, but can just toggle on chat in Figma to use audio.</p>
<p>Figma didn&#8217;t build its voice chat from scratch, but rather worked with a partner to bring this to market. Figma did not specify which partner/tech it&#8217;s working with on voice chat.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of FigJam and voice chat, Figma is also releasing a more full-featured mobile app, which will be in beta through TestFlight at launch.</p>

<p>One final update that Figma is announcing today is branching and merging in Figma. This allows designers who are updating the design system, for example, to branch out and do their work and then merge that work with the existing design system, rather than updating a shared component or resource and affecting everyone else&#8217;s workflow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent laws allowing healthcare providers to refuse care because of conscientious beliefs and denying care to transgender individuals might not seem like an issue for the tech industry at first blush, but these types of legislation directly contradict the core values of health tech.</p>
<p>Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson last month signed into law <a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R&amp;measureno=SB289">S.B. 289</a>, known as the “Medical Ethics and Diversity Act,” which allows anyone who provides healthcare services &#8212; not just doctors &#8212; to refuse to give non-emergency care if they believe the care goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Arkansas is <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/374077-health-care-conscience-laws-infringe-on-the-rights-of-others">one of several states in the U.S. that have been pushing laws like this </a>over the past several years. These &#8220;conscience laws&#8221; are harmful to all patients &#8212; particularly LGBTQ individuals, women and rural citizens &#8212; especially because over <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/25/20929539/catholic-hospitals-religious-refusal-rural-health-care-evan-minton">40% of available hospital beds are controlled by Catholic institutions</a> in some states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Non-emergency&#8221; service is open to interpretation</h2>
<p>The Arkansas legislation is one giant slippery slope. Even beyond the direct effects that the law would have on reproductive rights and the LGBTQ community, it leaves open questions about the many different services that medical professionals could decline simply by saying it goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Broadly letting healthcare providers decide which services they will perform based on religion, ethics or conscience essentially eliminates protections patients have under federal anti-discrimination regulations.</p>
<p>What constitutes an &#8220;emergency&#8221; to one doctor or EMT may be deemed a &#8220;non-emergency&#8221; by another. By allowing medical professionals to avoid performing some services, the bill can be interpreted as allowing anyone involved in the provision of healthcare services to avoid performing any kind of service, as long as they say they believed it wasn&#8217;t an emergency at the time.</p>
<p>The law also allows individuals to refuse to refer patients to someone who would provide the desired service for them. This places an undue burden on patients with physical or mental health issues and causes delays in treatment as the patient searches for an alternate provider. In cases of health and life-threatening issues, for example, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/catholic-hospitals-refuse-to-treat_n_5b06c82fe4b05f0fc8458db3">women have been refused treatment at Catholic medical institutions and forced to ride to the closest emergency care center</a>.</p>
<h2>The health tech community is working to improve the health of all</h2>
<p>The Arkansas law runs counter to the values of the businesses that are working hard to develop and improve medical technologies. Health tech startups at their core are fighting to provide more and better services to more patients &#8212; whether it’s by building platforms to make healthcare accessible to all, developing specific medical devices to improve the quality of service or researching new treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p>Imagine developing a vaccine for a global pandemic and then allowing doctors the right to refuse to administer it because it’s open to interpretation whether the virus represents an emergency to specific people. Or imagine <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwi/pr/hospital-pharmacist-plead-guilty-attempting-spoil-hundreds-covid-vaccine-doses">a hospital pharmacist who deliberately tries to spoil hundreds of vaccine doses</a> because of the conspiracy theories he believes. Laws like the one in Arkansas open up the healthcare system to abuse by conspiracy theorists, and it is already the case that many <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/wellness-qanon-coronavirus/">wellness providers are basing their advice and services on QAnon falsehoods</a>.</p>
<p>The health tech community is not just developing medications and devices for patients whose beliefs are similar to their own. Equally, medical professionals should not be making it harder for people to get needed medical care based on personal feelings. On the contrary, the ultimate goal of health tech businesses and healthcare providers alike should be a singular focus on improving the quality of care for all.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Medical ethics&#8221; and anti-LGBTQ laws are unethical</h2>
<p>As the health tech community continues to work tirelessly to bring new solutions to the marketplace to improve the health of everyone, it must also stand against laws like this, which threaten to eradicate the important gains that have been made in enhancing the lives and health of patients.</p>
<p>The Arkansas law &#8212; and others like it &#8212; place the burden of finding appropriate care on the patient instead of on the medical community, where it belongs. These laws must be repealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was “the eighth wonder of the world,” Donald Trump said, driving a golden shovel into the ground. The then-president touted Foxconn’s planned Wisconsin factory as a major win for his economic goals.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, the future of the manufacturing deal is far less certain. Earlier this week, the state announced a dramatic scaling back of a plan it had hoped would return blue-collar jobs back to the hard hit state. The Taiwanese manufacturing giant is scaling back its investment from $10 billion to $672 million.</p>
<p>The new plans also call for a massive cut to potential headcount &#8212; to 1,454, down from 13,000. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers framed the reduction as a tax-saving deal in <a href="https://wedc.org/blog/gov-evers-announces-renegotiated-foxconn-contract-to-save-taxpayers-2-77-billion/">a press release issued this week</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“When I ran to be governor, I made a promise to work with Foxconn to cut a better deal for our state—the last deal didn’t work for Wisconsin, and that doesn’t work for me,” Evers said. “Today I’m delivering on that promise with an agreement that treats Foxconn like any other business and will save taxpayers $2.77 billion, protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure investments the state and local communities have already made, and ensure there’s accountability for creating the jobs promised.”</p>
<p>Evers stepped into the role of Governor in 2019, following Scott Walker, who played a key role in negotiating the deal under Trump. The package included in the neighborhood of $4 billion in incentives for Foxconn, a record-breaking deal for the firm.</p>
<p>Plans for the TV factory shifted considerably since it was announced nearly four years ago, and in early 2019, it appeared that Foxconn had abandoned it altogether, before a phone call from Trump apparently put plans back on track.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/foxconn-sharply-scales-back-wisconsin-investment-2021-04-20/">Reuters notes</a>, the state has already spent in excess of $200 million on infrastructure, training and other aspects ahead of the planned factory opening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a major update to <a href="https://meet.google.com/">Meet</a>, its video-meeting service, which brings several user interface tweaks for desktop users, as well as quite a bit of new functionality, including multipinning so that you can highlight multiple feeds instead of just one, as well as new AI-driven video capabilities for light adjustments, autozoom and a new Data Saver feature that limits data usage on slower mobile networks.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re increasingly tired of video meetings (to the point where I often just keep the camera off). But the reality is that this style of meeting will be with us for the foreseeable future, whether we like them or not.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141684" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141684" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141684 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141684" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google notes that today&#8217;s release is meant to make meetings &#8220;more immersive, inclusive and productive.&#8221; The new UI doesn&#8217;t look to be a radical change, but it puts more of the controls and features right at your fingertips instead of hiding them in a menu. It also consolidates them in the bottom row instead of the current system that spreads out features between the main menu bar and an additional small menu at the top.</p>
<p>For presenters who don&#8217;t want to see themselves on the screen, Meet now also lets you minimize or completely hide your own video feed &#8212; and if you really want to glance into your own eyes, you can also pin your feed to the rest of the grid. Google says it also plans to soon let you turn off your self-feed across all Meet calls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about pinning, one feature that seems especially useful is the ability to highlight multiple feeds. This new multipinning capability will make it easier to focus on the participants in a chat that are most active, for example. This feature will roll out in the coming months.</p>
<p>And coming in a few months, some of those highlighted feeds may look a bit more interesting (or annoying, depending on your point of view) because one new feature Google has planned &#8212; but isn&#8217;t ready to roll out yet &#8212; is video background replacement. For now, Google will only offer three scenes: a classroom, a party and a forest. The company says more will follow, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;ll be able to bring your own videos to this feature anytime soon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141710" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141710" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141710" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141710" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other new features in this release include Meet&#8217;s capability to automatically spruce up your video feed a bit to make sure you&#8217;re more visible in a dark environment and enhance your video when you are sitting in front of a bright background. This will roll out in the coming weeks. There&#8217;s also autozoom, which uses AI to automatically zoom in on you and put you in the middle of your frame. That&#8217;s coming to paid Google Workspace subscribers in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the words of co-founder and CEO Jonathan Shambroom, <a href="https://www.creatorplus.com">Creator+</a> is a new startup that will &#8220;finance, produce and distribute feature-length films from today&#8217;s top creators and emerging storytellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is coming out of stealth today and also announcing that it has raised $12 million in funding led by Petra Group and Freestyle Capital, with participation from Jake Roper, Peter Hollens, Wendy Ayche (aka Wengie), Selina Tobaccowala, Jazwares CEO Judd Zebersky and others.</p>
<p>Shambroom (who&#8217;s been an executive at numerous startups and also served as general manager at Crackle) told me that one of the key aspects of the Creator+ strategy is that it controls &#8220;both sides of the equation&#8221; — it&#8217;s both producing films and building its own streaming platform, where the movies will be available for individual purchase, with no subscriptions and no ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that allows the startup to control costs and distribution, but it also &#8220;enables us to do something brand new with creators,&#8221; giving them a 50-50 split on revenue, as well as sharing audience data and ownership of the intellectual property.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creator&#8221; is a term that gets used pretty broadly, and Creator+ isn&#8217;t announcing any specific deals today. But co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Benjamin Grubbs (who previously led creator partnerships at YouTube) told me the company is initially focused on &#8220;storytellers and artists.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/">Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/embed/#?secret=4flKgWJgdP" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that there are a lot of gifted storytellers on some of these large, open, ad-supported platforms where they already reach large audiences and fan bases,&#8221; Grubbs said. &#8220;But there are constraints, whether that’s time-based or economic, on the types of stories that you can actually tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Creator+ will allow those creators to break free of some of those constraints, making feature films with budgets in the low seven figures. Shambroom said the startup wants to deliver &#8220;what people expect in a film, 90 minutes give-or-take … in many of the genres that exist today&#8221; while also allowing creators to experiment with new formats and new production technologies. In some cases, these movies could be a creator&#8217;s &#8220;passion project,&#8221; while in other cases Creator+ could match them up with the right script.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a multitude of roles and opportunities for creators, both in front of or behind the camera,&#8221; Grubbs added.</p>
<p>Creator+ plans to put between five and 10 films into production this year, with the first titles released in 2022. Shambroom said it&#8217;s committed to supporting underrepresented storytellers and has already hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benokeefe/">Ben O&#8217;Keefe</a> as its head of diversity and impact. The team also has global ambitions, which is why they brought on international investors, including Malaysia-based Petra Group.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The tidal wave of growth is upon us — an unprecedented economic boom that will manifest later this year, bringing significant investments, acquisitions and customer growth. But most tech companies and startups are not adequately prepared to capitalize on the opportunity that lies ahead.</p>
<p>Here’s how marketing in tech will shift — and what you need to know to reach more customers and accelerate growth in 2021.</p>
<p>First and foremost, differentiation is going to be imperative. It’s already hard enough to stand out and get noticed, and it’s about to get much more difficult as new companies emerge and investments and budgets balloon in the latter half of the year. Virtually all major companies are increasing budgets to pre-pandemic levels, but will delay those investments until the second half of the year. This will result in an increased intensity of competition that will drown out any undifferentiated players.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The second half of 2021 will bring incredible growth, the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Additionally, tech companies need to be mindful not to ignore the most important part of the ecosystem: people. Technology will only take you so far, and it’s not going to be enough to survive the competition. Marketing is about people, including your customers, team, partners, investors and the broader community.</p>
<p>Understanding who your people are and how you can use their help to build a strong foundation and drive exponential growth is essential.</p>
<p>Tactically, the most successful tech companies will embrace video and experimentation in their marketing — two components that will catapult them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Ignoring these predictions, backed by empirical evidence, will be detrimental and devastating. Fasten your seatbelts: 2021 is going to be a turbocharged year of growth opportunities for marketing in tech.</p>
<h2>Differentiation is crucial</h2>
<p>The explosion of tech companies and startups seeking to be the next big thing isn&#8217;t over yet. However, many of them are indistinguishable from each other and lack a compelling value proposition. Just one look at the websites of new and existing tech companies will reveal a proliferation of buzzwords and conceptual illustrations, leaving them all looking and sounding alike.</p>
<p>The tech companies that succeed are those that embrace one of the fundamentals of effective marketing — positioning.</p>
<p>In the ’80s, Al Ries and Jack Trout published &#8220;Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind&#8221; and coined the term<em>,</em> which documented the best-known approach to standing out in a noisy marketplace. As the market heats up, companies will realize the need to sharpen their positioning and dial in their focus to break through the noise.</p>
<p>To get attention and build traction, companies need to establish a position they can own. The mashup method — &#8220;Netflix but for coding lessons&#8221; — is not real positioning; it’s simply a lazy gimmick.</p>
<p>It is imperative to identify who your ideal customer is and not just who <em>could</em> use your product. Focusing on a segment of the market rather than the whole is, perhaps counterintuitively, the most effective approach to capturing the larger market.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B payments space has seen an explosion in demand, and investor interest, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses try to figure out how to pay each other digitally. The challenges become even more complex when dealing with cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups that were formed before the pandemic stand to benefit from the shift. One such startup, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.tribal.credit">Tribal Credit</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched its beta in late 2019 to provide payment products for startups and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Tribal Credit announced it has raised $34.3 million in a combined Series A and debt round led by QED Investors and Partners for Growth (PFG). Existing backers BECO Capital, Global Ventures, OTG Ventures and Endure Capital also participated in the round, along with new investor Endeavor Catalyst. The raise follows “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10x” year-over-year growth, according to CEO and co-founder Amr Shady.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the investment, Tribal received $3 million from the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stellar Development</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a nonprofit organization that supports the development and growth of the open-source Stellar blockchain network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal uses a proprietary AI-driven underwriting approval process to evaluate businesses and approve them for credit lines. Those businesses can then use those credit lines to spend on Tribal’s products, Tribal Card and Tribal Pay. Tribal Card is a business Visa card that allows users to create physical and virtual multi-currency cards. Tribal Pay allows them to make payments to merchants and suppliers that don’t accept credit cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its value proposition lies not only in its ability to provide SMEs with virtual and physical corporate cards, but also a digital platform that allows founders and CFOs “to give access to and manage the spend of their distributed teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen more demand for making B2B online payments amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with many SMEs migrating to digital and spending more on online products and services,” Shady told TechCrunch. “Companies in this new economy are digital and global first. The need for a corporate card was accelerated. As card spend grew during the pandemic, this meant greater liability on founders’ using their personal cards, or other competing cards linked to their personal credit.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal, he said, underwrites the company without impacting the founders’ credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another accelerator for its products was how the pandemic forced teams to work remotely. Founders and CFOs needed a way to provide access to corporate payments while maintaining control, Shady pointed out. Tribal’s platform aims to streamline financial operations for a distributed team. </span></p>

<p>Of course, Tribal is not the only company offering credit cards for startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Brex</a>, which has amassed $465 million in venture capital funding to date, also markets a credit card tailored for startups. While the companies are similar, there is a distinct difference, according to Shady: &#8220;Emerging market SMEs have different pains, particularly when it comes to cross-border payments.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal&#8217;s initial efforts are focused on Latin America, in particular Mexico, which is the startup&#8217;s biggest market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its new capital will go toward accelerating its growth in the region, according to Shady. In particular, the equity will go toward growing Tribal’s leadership team in Mexico, while the debt will fuel the company’s customers’ growing credit lines, Shady said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have invested heavily in our product over the past year,” Shady said. “We’re the first mover in our segment in LatAm with a diverse suite of SME products that includes corporate cards, wire payments and treasury services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">Roku acquired the program catalog from Quibi</a>, the short-form video app backed by Jeffrey Katzenberg that had failed to gain traction amid the pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-is-dead/">despite nearly $2 billion in financing</a>. Quibi had been designed for on-the-go viewing, but launched when users were staying at home &#8212; watching TV on bigger screens and for longer periods of time. But now Quibil&#8217;s shows will return. Roku <a href="https://blog.roku.com/roku-originals">announced</a> today that Quibi&#8217;s catalog will be rebranded as &#8220;Roku Originals,&#8221; and will arrive on The Roku Channel in the near future.</p>
<p>Roku says it will offer more details about its launch plans in May.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s Roku Originals will become available to stream for free within The Roku Channel, the media platform&#8217;s ad-supported streaming hub for TV, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/roku-launches-its-own-channel-featuring-free-ad-supported-movies/">movies</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/rokus-adds-news-to-its-free-channel-including-the-new-streaming-network-abc-news-live/">news</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/the-roku-channel-expands-to-include-over-100-live-channels-adds-a-live-tv-guide/">live TV,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/roku-expands-its-free-streaming-channel-with-entertainment-and-live-sports/">sports</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/roku-launches-a-kids-family-section-on-the-roku-channel-plus-parental-controls/">more</a>. The originals arriving will include a range of content, including scripted and unscripted series, as well as documentaries. At launch, these will be available to users in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. only.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Quibi&#8217;s service had made headlines for its shows that featured several big names from Hollywood, including Anna Kendrick, Chrissy Teigen, Lena Waithe, Idris Elba, Kevin Hart and Liam Hemsworth, among others. But none of the Quibi content had been compelling enough to push consumers to subscribe to Quibi&#8217;s service &#8212; that is, Quibi didn&#8217;t have a flagship show like &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; or a new &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; series to draw people in. It didn&#8217;t have any classics, either, like &#8220;The Office&#8221; or &#8220;Friends.&#8221; Instead, Quibi was relying on the combination of star power and its &#8220;quick bites&#8221; mobile viewing format to attract users. But the latter no longer made sense when life on the go had been shut down. And for escapist, short-form entertainment, users already had TikTok.</p>
<p>Today, Roku notes that while the Quibi shows will serve as the initial backbone for its Roku Originals catalog, it plans to launch more original programming in the future under this brand.</p>
<p>In 2021, the company will roll out over 75 Roku Originals, which will include Quibi&#8217;s catalog and other unreleased series that never got the chance to air on Quibi before its shutdown. This will complement The Roku Channel&#8217;s existing lineup of over 40,000 free movies and programs, and its over 165 free live, linear TV channels.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s streaming business got a big boost during the pandemic, which brought in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-q4-2020-beats-estimates-record-revenue-1234910714/">a record $649.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and pushed Roku to a $65.2 million profit</a> when Wall Street was expecting a loss. Active users were also up 39% year over year to 51.2 million, and The Roku Channel&#8217;s free hub grew faster, doubling to 63 million people. With originals, Roku has a chance to further retain that audience, even as the pandemic bump starts to fade and users go back to their regular lives as vaccination rates increase and workplaces reopen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-acquires-rights-to-quibi-s-content-11610116056#">Wall Street Journal had earlier reported</a> Roku paid less than $100 million for Quibi&#8217;s catalog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a> last night priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210420006244/en/UiPath-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $56 per share</a>, above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised price target range of $52 to $54</a>. The company sold 9,416,384 shares at that price, alongside 14,474,393 from existing shareholders. Its underwriters can purchase 3,583,616 shares at its IPO price if they so choose.</p>
<p>UiPath raised $527.3 million on a gross basis for the primary shares that it sold in the transaction, a deal that values the company at around $29.1 billion on a nondiluted basis. On a fully diluted basis, The Exchange calculates that UiPath is worth up to $31 billion.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>UiPath&#8217;s pricing run has been fascinating to watch. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">proposed a $43 to $50 per-share IPO price range</a>; at that price, UiPath was worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion on a nondiluted basis. A coup? For a company that valued at just over $10 billion a year ago, you&#8217;d think so. The company&#8217;s final IPO price is nearly a tripling of its 2020 worth.</p>
<p>But for UiPath, things are complicated by a 2021 private round that valued the company at $35 billion, a figure that weighs somewhat heavily around the company&#8217;s neck.</p>

It got away with raising $750 million at an inflated price before turning around and raising another half-billion at a more reasonable (more on that in a moment) valuation while providing all but its very final investors with excellent returns.</p>
<p>Its employees should do well, too, I reckon. (And Alphabet. Perhaps the company can now <a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-contractors-forced-unemployment">afford to bring more of its contractors on full-time</a> thanks to, say, the nearly 21x return that its late-stage group CapitalG made on the 13 million UiPath shares it purchased during its Series B.)</p>
<p>Regardless, after watching the UiPath IPO pricing dance from its first S-1 filing through settling at $56 per share, I think the only parties that should feel a bit silly are the investors who decided that pushing up the value of the former startup by 3.5x in a less than a year was durable logic. Let&#8217;s talk about why.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the world’s organizations shifted to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But even as more people are vaccinated and offices are planning re-openings, it’s clear that for some organizations, remote work is here to stay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel, a startup that provides payroll, compliance tools and other services to help businesses hire remotely, has seen increased demand in the wake of this shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the San Francisco company has announced that it has raised $156 million in Series C funding led by the YC Continuity Fund and existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, former Stripe payments guru Lachy Groom, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jeff Wilke and Anthony Schiller also participated in the round, among others. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise is notable for a few reasons. For one, it comes just over seven months after Deel raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $30 million Series B </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing. So it is essentially more than 5x the size of that round. It’s also a big deal because it propels Deel, a three-year-old company, to unicorn status with a $1.25 billion valuation &#8212; which is even more meaningful considering the company was valued at $225 million post-money just seven months prior. The raise also comes after a massive year of growth for Deel, which says it saw a “20x” increase in revenue in 2020 with over 1,800 business clients. That’s up from 500 at the time of its September raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founded by MIT alumni Alex Bouaziz and Shuo Wan, Deel aims to allow businesses “to hire anyone, anywhere, in a compliant manner.” It claims that by using its services, businesses can hire and onboard international employees or contractors in less than five minutes, with no local entity required and that “paying them in 120+ currencies takes just a click.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel plans to use its new capital to continue an international expansion and set up 80 new Deel-owned entities across the world in 2021. Deel also plans to do some hiring itself, and grow its product offerings. The company’s own team is entirely remote, and has grown from seven employees to more than 120 across 26 countries since January 2020. CB Insights projects the industry for virtual HR software will grow to</span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/remote-hiring-startups-gaining-traction/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$43 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026 as technology platforms like Deel help businesses make the transition to remote-first work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC Continuity’s Ali Rowghani, who has joined Deel’s board as part of the funding, believes Deel was already at the forefront of remote work pre-pandemic and that “it will be long after.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way people work is fundamentally changing&#8230; the [Deel] team is uniquely equipped to remove the obstacles of remote work so companies hire the best talent in the world, instead of only those nearest to them,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch previously reported, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel today already provides various tools to employees and the organizations that they work for, such as payroll services, tax compliance information, assistance on building contracts, invoicing services and a range of insurance options covering health and other areas related to working life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the plan is to continue building out that stack with more services aimed at both the workers and their employers. That includes loans based on salary for workers, more insurance and benefits options and other offerings.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and Danny wanted to chat crypto. No, not cryptography, but cryptocurrency. The topic has been hot in recent months thanks to Coinbase, recent weeks thanks to the rapid price appreciation in the value of many coins, and in recent days because dogecoin went crazy.</p>
<p><em>Vote for <a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/technology">Equity to win a Webby</a> so that our parents can be proud!</em></p>
<p>So with our minds tuned to the future of money, and commerce, and content, here&#8217;s the show&#8217;s rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent crypto news has been more than busy, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">Venmo adding crypto support</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-giant-binance-hires-former-top-bank-regulator-11618912800">Brian Brooks joining Binance</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">the Coinbase direct listing</a>.</li>
<li>But that&#8217;s not all, there have been a host of NFT marketplaces that have raised millions in the past week. We talk about <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93707/nft-marketplace-rarible-raises-1-75-million-in-seed-funding-round">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/99869/nft-marketplace-superrare-funding-round">SuperRare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">OpenSea</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation">Dapper Labs. </a>We talk about differentiation, UX and if more than one marketplace can win.</li>
<li>Dogecoin&#8217;s <em>to the moon </em>moment had reached a new price high and come down some before our show recorded, but the cryptocurrency&#8217;s joke apparently is still funny after all these years. Here&#8217;s a<a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1384459900147933184/photo/2"> tweet</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dogecoin-traders-whip-up-doge-day-frenzy-in-push-toward-1-11618842535?mod=hp_lead_pos11">an article</a> about it.</li>
<li>The idea that Coinbase&#8217;s successful direct listing will matter for investors betting on crypto-focused startups is true, at least according to investors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">More on that here, </a>and hit us up if you want a sweet discount code to get past that paywall.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://welcome.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built a digital platform aimed at immigrants and their families, has raised $35 million in a Series B funding round co-led by TTV Capital, Owl Ventures and SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/softbank-launches-100m-opportunity-growth-fund-to-invest-in-founders-of-color/">Opportunity Fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosscut Ventures, Mubadala Capital, Next Play Capital and Owl Capital also participated in the financing, which brings the Los Angeles-based company&#8217;s total raised to $50 million since its 2010 inception. Welcome Tech, which has an office in San Antonio, Texas, raised an $8 million Series A in March of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built by immigrants for immigrants, Welcome Tech aims to do just what its name indicates &#8212; help immigrants feel more welcome, have an easier transition and achieve greater success when moving to the United States.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s approach was different in that rather than launch a banking product and then set out to earn the trust of the community it aims to serve, it first worked hard to earn that trust and understand the community’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in its first years of existence, Welcome Tech has focused on building out a platform that provides educational resources, information and services that “they need to thrive in a  new country.” Its efforts are initially primarily focused on the Hispanic community in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of its platform, dubbed </span><a href="https://saberespoder.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SABEResPODER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning Knowledge is Power in Spanish),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to serve as “a widely recognized and trusted resource” to members of the Hispanic community in the U.S., the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with knowledge and data that it has gathered over the years, Welcome Tech six months ago launched a banking service, including a debit card and bilingual mobile app. And in January, it launched a monthly subscription offering that gives users access to discounted resources such as medical and dental professionals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardiner Garrard, co-founder and partner, TTV Capital, points out that the Hispanic market represents the </span><a href="https://multicultural.com/articles/the-2020-hispanic-market-report-now-available-from-claritas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest minority cohort in the U.S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">., with a population of 62.8 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, less than half of Hispanic households are ‘fully banked’, meaning they cannot open an account, which then negatively impacts their ability to secure other products or services,” Garrard said. “To not serve this community is a major failure. Welcome Tech is addressing this issue head on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Welcome’s platform is approaching 3 million active users, according to co-founder and CEO Amir Hemmat. Its ultimate goal, he said, is to serve as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital Ellis Island.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we leave immigrants’ success to chance is pretty crazy,” he told TechCrunch. “If you think of countries the way you think of companies and the way they want to attract and retain&#8230;here, we almost do the opposite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Hemmat and co-founder Raul Lomeli-Azoubel recognized that access to financial services was crucial to immigrants’ success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although we ultimately see ourselves building towards a better future for immigration and a broader platform, the foundation and beachhead for that is definitely in financial services,” Hemmat said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome offers a free banking account that is fully bilingual for English and Spanish speaking communities with “key features that are very tailor made for this community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of new digital banks targeting Latino and immigrant communities in general have emerged in recent years, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Welcome aims to differentiate itself from competitors in being a more broad-based platform. Its subscription offering &#8212; at $10 a month &#8212; does things like offer discounts to healthcare professionals and free televisits, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we dug in, we realized that immigrants are not being provided data-driven recommendations,” Hemmat said. “It’s very much a word of mouth and trial of error, and in some cases highly predatory, experience. We’re working to aggregate a historically fragmented audience and that gives us massive leverage to source better offerings, pricing and experiences for consumers across multiple categories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to build more partnerships so that it can do the above, as well as spread awareness about its services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosia Karas, investment director and head of growth stage investments at SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund, told TechCrunch that the fact that the immigrant population in the U.S. is “growing really fast and underserved creates an opportunity for someone to come in and serve them well with a financial services offering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, SoftBank was attracted to Welcome Tech’s approach to truly understand, and gather data around, its target market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before even jumping head first into building a fintech company, they did a lot of work prior,” Karas said. “They spent years building an understanding of this audience of the immigrant population, including building trust within that demographic. And at the same time, they have been building targeted content. This serves as a really great backbone to build a company that is very well-suited to serve that audience and to roll out things like the debit card and other financial services offerings.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.misfitsmarket.com">Misfits Market</a>, a startup known for selling &#8220;ugly&#8221; fruits and vegetables at discount prices, announced this morning that it has raised $200 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>The company says this brings its total funding to $301.5 million and moves its valuation into unicorn territory (i.e. above $1 billion). It isn&#8217;t getting any more specific about that valuation, though <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/misfits-market-funding-round-brings-valuation-to-1-1-billion">Bloomberg reports</a> that it&#8217;s $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Abhi Ramesh told me that the Delanco, New Jersey-based startup has expanded beyond produce into a variety of grocery categories. At the same time, he said all of its products remain united by a focus on &#8220;a single word, which is value.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Misfits Market products are discounted by up to 40% compared to what you&#8217;d find in other grocery stores (in-person or online), which Ramesh said the company achieves by purchasing products that regular stores won&#8217;t buy or sell, often for &#8220;crazy, random&#8221; reasons. For example, he said the company recently purchased 50,000 bottles of perfectly good olive oil &#8220;where the labeling was just angled the wrong way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company says its active customer base and order volume grew 5x last year, when it shipped 77 million pounds of food to more than 400,000 customers. Ramesh said it was a big challenge to meet increased consumer demand (and it did have to create a long wait list for a while), but Misfits had advantages that many other grocery companies did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately, because we operate our own fulfillment centers and we have our own internal tech built around this, we were not constrained by the same constraints that physical grocery stores have, where we have to close at 9 p.m. every day, where we have to make room for regular foot traffic and Instacart shoppers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For us, we just have to scale our fulfillment centers, which is easier said than done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new round was led by Accel and D1 Capital, with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Sound Ventures, Third Kind Ventures and others. Accel&#8217;s Ryan Sweeney is joining Misfits&#8217; board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Direct-to-consumer models aren&#8217;t anything new in the food industry, but the approach Misfits Market has taken is,” Sweeney said in a statement. “Instead of focusing only on their end customer, they’ve managed to create a dynamic solution that also supports food suppliers at every level.”</p>
<p>With the new funding, Misfits Market plans to continue expanding into new grocery categories and new geographies. For example, it&#8217;s taking its first orders from Oregon and Washington today, and Ramesh said his goal is to be shipping to &#8220;100% of ZIP codes in the 48 lower states&#8221; in the next 12 months.</p>
