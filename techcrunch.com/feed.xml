										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deliver code ever faster, they need tooling to provide some semblance of control and governance over the cloud resources being used to deliver it. <a href="https://www.env0.com/">Env0</a>, a startup that is helping companies do just that, announced a $17 million Series A today.</p>
<p>M12, Microsoft’s Venture Fund, led the round with participation from previous investors Boldstart Ventures, Grove Ventures and Crescendo Ventures. The company received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/">a $3.3 million seed round</a>, which we covered, last April and a previously unannounced $3.5 million add-on last summer. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $23.8 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service helps companies control cloud costs, while giving developers the ability to deploy to the cloud with cost limits. It also provides a level of governance for code as it moves through the development cycle to deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When we spoke to the company last April<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/"> around its seed round</a>, the company&#8217;s product was just entering beta. It has been generally available for about 4 months now and they&#8217;ve built out a lot of functionality since then, according to company co-founder and CEO Ohad Maislish.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time we spoke we were just focussed on manual self service and empowering developers in non production environments. Now with infrastructure as code automation and teams and governance, we basically manage all of the cloud deployments for our customers,&#8221; Maislish explained.</p>
<p>Since going generally available with the product this year, he reports the company now has dozens of paying customers and is generating revenue. Customers includes JFrog, Varonis and BigID.</p>
<p>The startup has also grown from just 7 employees in April 2020 to 17 today with plans to reach 50 in the next 18 months it begins putting the new capital to work. He says that bringing in a diverse group of workers should help his company grow and bring different ways of solving problems. &#8220;I think that bringing people with different cultures, different backgrounds, is key in that they will bring [different ways of thinking].&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the company is based in Israel with plans to open offices in the U.S.. Mailslish says that his plans to move to California were put on hold by the pandemic, but he hopes to open an office in Sunnyvale in the fall.</p>
<p>The Israeli office is a minimum of two days in the office, three days at home or whatever combination employees wish. He says that he plans to hire people in the U.S. office as he establishes himself there and some of those employees can be remote if it makes sense for the role.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The business operation automation startup's CEO says the new capital will give it the space it needs to hire and build faster than if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business operation automation startup <a href="https://tonkean.com/">Tonkean</a> announced this morning that it closed a $50 million Series B round of capital. Accel led the round, which came just over a year after the startup <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tonkean-closes-24m-series-a-to-automate-operations/">raised a $24 million Series A</a>. Lightspeed Ventures, which led the company&#8217;s preceding venture capital round, also participated in its new funding event.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/esbsagi?lang=en">Sagi Eliyahu</a>, Tonkean&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview that his company&#8217;s valuation rose by around 4x in its latest funding round.</p>
<p>The startup was able to secure more capital at a higher price thanks in part to quick growth in 2020, which Eliyahu said was concentrated in the second half of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tonkean is an interesting mix of business process automation, no-code and humans. In short, the startup allows a company&#8217;s ops groups &#8212; sales ops, marketing ops, etc. &#8212; to set up automated business logic across applications that can include human-in-the-loop elements. And Tonkean built its system to be IT-friendly, allowing it to support enterprise-scale customers.</p>
<p>The automation space has been broadly hot in recent quarters. Robotic process automation (RPA) is great for mechanizing repetitive tasks that waste human time. The method of using computers to do stuff that humans previously had to do by clicking far too much has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">proven to be big business</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TrnbToiERV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/embed/#?secret=TrnbToiERV" data-secret="TrnbToiERV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonkean allows for something a bit different. An example may help: During our interview, Eliyahu mused about what might happen if a salesperson for a Tonkean client wanted to send a lead into a nurture campaign. Tonkean would let the sales ops team set up logic so that when the frontline salesperson selects the lead for a nurture effort inside their CRM, the lead would then automatically be added to a specific Marketo campaign. Furthermore, the click-to-nurture system would alert a human on the sales team, perhaps asking for approval of the decision.</p>
<p>Tonkean software employs no-code tools to let ops groups use off-the-shelf command modules to build business logic &#8212; or craft their own as needed. The use of the company&#8217;s software could allow for more empowered teams at companies that are less reliant on engineering groups for help in accelerating and automating their work.</p>
<p>That thematically fits inside the general narrative we&#8217;ve seen from no-code startups in general: They want to allow non-technical folks to have more control of their work through less reliance on technical teams at their place of employment.</p>
<p>Tonkean employs around 60 people today, up from around 15 folks at the time of its Series A. It plans to hire rapidly now that it has more capital. Eliyahu claims most of its Series A is still in the bank. So why did it raise?</p>
<p>Because Eliyahu considers his startup&#8217;s market to be so large that he wants to pull the company&#8217;s future closer to today; the new capital will give Tonkean the space it needs to hire more rapidly and build more quickly than it might have if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case.</p>
<p>Fifty million dollars is a lot of money. Let&#8217;s see how far it gets Tonkean. The next time we talk to the company, we&#8217;ll demand some harder growth metrics so we can see if the additional capital was the accelerant that the company hopes it will be.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s 2021 and there are no IRL events coming up, so we&#8217;re bringing back the live show, but on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/tc-equity-live">Hopin</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update:</strong> Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/">now confirmed</a> the delay, writing in a blog post that its engagement with UK regulators over the so-called &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; means support for tracking cookies won&#8217;t start being phased out in Chrome until the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to continue to work with the web community to create more private approaches to key areas, including ad measurement, delivering relevant ads and content, and fraud detection,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Today, Chrome and others have offered more than 30 proposals, and four of those proposals are available in origin trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Chrome, specifically, our goal is to have the key technologies deployed by late 2022 for the developer community to start adopting them. Subject to our engagement with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and in line with the <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29&quot;}">commitments</a> we have offered, Chrome could then phase out third-party cookies over a three month period, starting in mid-2023 and ending in late 2023.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The delay gives the adtech industry more time to adapt to a post-tracking-cookie online realm &#8212; assuming the CMA is happy to let Google go ahead with the major retooling.</p>
<p><em>Our original report follows below&#8230; </em></p>
<p>Adtech giant Google appears to be leaning toward postponing a long planned deprecation of third party tracking cookies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">plan dates back to 2019</a> when it <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html">announced</a> the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">long-term initiative</a> that will make it harder for online marketers and advertisers to track web users, including by deprecating third party cookies in Chrome.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> it said it would make the switch within two years. Which would mean by 2022.</p>

<p>Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it has a Privacy Sandbox announcement incoming today &#8212; set for 4pm BST/5pm CET &#8212; after we contacted it to ask for confirmation of information we&#8217;d heard, via our own sources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been told Google&#8217;s new official timeline for implementation will be 2023.</p>
<p>However a spokesman for the tech giant danced around providing a direct confirmation &#8212; saying that &#8220;an update&#8221; is incoming shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have an announcement today that will shed some light on Privacy Sandbox updates,&#8221; the spokesman also told us.</p>
<p>He had responded to our initial email &#8212; which had asked Google to confirm that it will postpone the implementation of Privacy Sandbox to 2023; and for any statement on the delay &#8212; with an affirmation (&#8220;yep&#8221;) so, well, a delay looks likely. But we&#8217;ll see how exactly Google will spin that in a few minutes when it publishes the incoming Privacy Sandbox announcement.</p>
<p>Google has previously said it would deprecate support for third party cookies by 2022 &#8212; which naturally implies that the wider Privacy Sandbox stack of related adtech would also need to be in place by then.</p>
<p>Earlier this year it slightly hedged the 2022 timeline, saying in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a> that any changes would not be made before 2022.</p>
<p>The issue for Google is that regulatory scrutiny of its plan has stepped up &#8212; following antitrust complaints from the adtech industry which faces huge changes to how it can track and target Internet users.</p>
<p>In Europe, the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has been working with the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office to understand the competition and privacy implications of Google&#8217;s planned move. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">earlier this month</a>, the CMA issued a notification of intention to accept proposed commitments from Google that would enable the regulator to block any deprecation of cookies if it&#8217;s not happy it can be done in a way that&#8217;s good for competition and privacy.</p>
<p>At the time we asked Google how the CMA&#8217;s involvement might impact the Privacy Sandbox timeline but the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Increased regulatory oversight of Big Tech will have plenty of ramifications &#8212; most obviously it means the end of any chance for giants like Google to &#8216;move fast and break things&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JW Player</a>, a very early mover in the market for online video technology &#8212; it powered YouTube&#8217;s first video player, before Google acquired it and it built its own &#8212; has long been profitable through a business model of providing one-to-many video streaming tools to publishers and others that want to bring video into their own online experiences, without building the technology from the ground up, nor being beholden to companies that might themselves profit from the videos and the customer data that is generated through video views.</p>
<p>Now, after a year of strong growth on the back of the bigger boom in online video from Covid-19, the New York-based company is announcing a big funding round &#8212; $100 million &#8212; to expand its tech, and to be where it believes video is going next.</p>
<p>The capital is coming from a single investor, <a href="https://www.llrpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLR Partners</a>, and while the JW Player&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, we understand it&#8217;s not quite yet at $1 billion, but fast approaching it. It comes on the heels of the company charting some massive growth, despite being a relatively quiet player in the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dave Otten, the CEO and co-founder of the company (which is named after another co-founder, Jeroen Wijering, who developed the initial technology), told TechCrunch in an interview that the company&#8217;s video streaming traffic by nearly 200% over the last year, with live streaming growing 400% in that period.</p>
<p>There are now over 600,000 applications and sites running video powered by JW Player, with about 10,000 of those premium users; the rest use its software for free, Otten said.</p>
<p>This is enough of a balance that the company has been profitable for a number of years, he said. And in cases where the software is being used for free, JW Player is getting &#8220;paid&#8221; in a  Some of the many customers using its tools include Sesame Street, TIME, Hearst, Insider, IMDB and the Chelsea Football Club.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2169713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?w=566" alt="" width="566" height="424" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png 566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long way away from JW&#8217;s early days powering YouTube &#8212; screen shot of how it looked above &#8212; but contrary to so many examples of early movers being some of the slowest to innovate later on, JW is hoping that the fact that it was a first mover in video does not mean it will be the last to anticipate what is coming in the future.</p>
<p>The current product challenge for JW Player mirrors that of its customers: monetization.</p>
<p>Just as companies have increasingly started to create paywalls around their written content, they are looking to do the same for their video catalogues, too, and JW Player wants to be their partner for this. That will include more investments into subscription services, as well as a a new set of tools for personalizing videos and providing advertising opportunities by way of the extensive data that it has amassed and continues to gather about video usage.</p>
<p>The company has a strong card to play in its hand for the latter business: those who use the free version of JW Player &#8220;pay&#8221; the company by way of helping it gather lots of insights into how videos are watched.</p>
<p>Another area that the company will be doing more is in the area of live and on-demand video. In May, it acquired Vualto, a UK-based specialist in these areas that also builds DRM solutions, which it has already integrated into its platform.</p>
<p>Video now accounts for a whopping 80% of all online traffic, with people typically spending more than two hours days watching it. While some of that is inevitably going big platforms like YouTube, Facebook, social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, there remains a big opportunity for others, aided by the likes of JW, to carve out spaces for themselves in the mix.</p>
<p>“JW Player has been at the forefront of digital video innovation ever since founder Jeroen Wijering created YouTube’s original video player in 2008. Today, the company offers the most comprehensive technology, advertising and data analytics platform in the digital video ecosystem,” said David Reuter, Partner at LLR Partners, in a statement. “We look forward to partnering with the JW Player team as they expand their platform and continue to elevate the way brands can host, stream and monetize video.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric propulsion developer Orbion Space Technology has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round, which it says it will use to scale production capacity of its Aurora propulsion system.</p>
<p>The Michigan-based startup manufactures Hall effect plasma thrusters for use in small and cube satellites. Thrusters are used throughout the lifespan of a satellite (or any object in space that needs to maintain its orbit, like the space station) to adjust orbital altitude, avoid collisions, and de-orbit the craft once it has reached the end of its useful life. Hall thrusters use a magnetic field to ionize a propellant and produce plasma.</p>
<p>While they have long been used in space, this type of thruster has mostly been too expensive for small satellite operators. <a href="https://orbionspace.com/">Orbion</a> says it has created a cost-effective production capacity to meet the growing demand of startups and developers launching to low Earth orbit. Orbion CEO Brad King said in a statement that the company considered contract manufacturers but ultimately chose a vertically integrated manufacturing model. Now, the company says it has outgrown its existing manufacturing space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is facing “unprecedented market demand” for its Aurora system, King said. With the boom of the so-called new space economy, driven in part by the decreased costs of processors, components and even launch, it’s no surprise that there’s been a concurrent uptick in demand for efficient in-space propulsion systems.</p>

<p>The company had previously raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/orbion-raises-9-2m-to-mass-produce-plasma-thrusters-for-small-satellites/">$9.2 million Series A</a> in August 2019. Since that time, the company secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/orbion-partners-with-u-s-department-of-defence-on-small-satellite-propulsion-tech/">research partnership</a> with the U.S. Department of Defense that’s testing the resiliency of American space systems. Orbion also landed a contract with satellite manufacturer Blue Canyon Technologies last September.</p>
<p>This most recent funding round was led by the US-India VC firm Inventus Capital Partners, with additional participation from Material Impact, Beringea and Wakestream Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The space game is changing,” Inventus Capital Partners investor Kanwal Rekhi said in a statement. “Large satellites are being replaced by a multitude of nano-satellites; just like the PCs replaced mainframes. Orbion is providing these nano-satellites maneuverability to get into more precise orbits and stay there longer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars and Luminar Technologies are beefing up their partnership. The two companies said Thursday that Luminar’s autonomous driving stack – a combination of hardware and software that includes lidar sensors and a proprietary perception system – will be standard on Volvo’s forthcoming flagship electric SUV.</p>
<p>Luminar had previously announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/">the production deal with Volvo last May</a>. But at that time, Luminar’s stack was going to be optional on the flagship vehicle — an upgrade that would add on cost. Now, it will be built into each vehicle as a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, customers will still have to pay if they want to take advantage of the Highway Pilot functionality. That capability, which will be available only when the vehicle is driving on a highway, puts the driver out of the loop — they won’t even have to actively monitor the vehicle, as is common in some systems already on the road today, a source familiar with the technology told TechCrunch. It’s the highest capability of autonomy that the system offers, and if customers want it, they will have to pay for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That functionality will be activated wirelessly when the conditions are verified to be safe, Luminar said in a news release. What customers won’t have to pay for is a suite of safety capabilities, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping, that target the most common cause of car accidents.</p>
<p>The deal is undoubtedly a major boon for Luminar. In addition to higher production volumes, the company will also benefit from the many thousands of driving miles its system will be exposed to — valuable data that it can feed back into its autonomous driving stack. The system will also be capable of wireless over-the-air updates, so drivers should benefit as it grows &#8216;smarter&#8217; over time.</p>
<p>Volvo did not reveal how much the Highway Pilot add-on will cost, nor whether it will be available in a subscription model or as a one-time purchase. But the carmaker did say that all vehicles will be “hardware ready” for unsupervised autonomous driving once it&#8217;s available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of startups were built to help people make all-cash offers on homes with the purpose of gaining an edge against other buyers, especially in ultra-competitive markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://accept.inc/">Accepti.inc</a> is a Denver-based company that is attempting to create a new category in real estate technology. To help scale its digital mortgage lending platform, the company announced today that it has secured $90 million in debt and equity – with $78 million in debt and $12 million in equity. Signal Fire led the equity portion of its financing, which also included participation from existing seed investors Y Combinator and DN Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept.inc describes itself as an iLender, or a “technology-enabled lender” that gives people a way to submit all-cash offers on a home upon qualifying for a mortgage.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using its platform, a buyer gets qualified first and then can start looking for homes that fall at or under the amount he or she is approved for. They can purchase a more expensive home, but any amount above what they are approved for would have to come out of pocket. Historically, most buyers don’t know that they will have to pay out of pocket until they’ve made an offer on a specific home and an appraisal comes under the amount of the price they are paying for a home. In those cases, the buyer has to cough up the difference out of pocket. With Accept.inc., its execs tout, buyers know upfront how much they are approved for and can spend on a new home “so there are no surprises later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SignalFire Founding Partner and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilya Kirnos describes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept.inc as “the first and only iLender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He points out that since it is a lender, Accept.inc doesn’t make its money by charging buyers fees like some others in the all-cash offer space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike ‘iBuyers’ or ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/homeward-secures-371m-to-help-people-make-all-cash-offers-on-homes/">alternative iBuyers</a>,’ Accept.inc fronts the cash to buy a house and then makes money off mortgage origination and title, meaning sellers, homebuyers and their agents pay no additional cost for the service,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBuyers instead buy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> homes from sellers who signed up online, make a profit by often fixing up and selling those homes and then helping people purchase a different home with all cash. They also make money by charging transaction fees. A slew of companies operate in the space including established players such as <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer">Opendoor</a> and Zillow and newer players such as Homelight.</span></p>

Left to right: Co-founders Adam Pollack, Nick Friedman and Ian Perrex.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2016 inception, Accept.inc says it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped thousands of buyers, agents and sellers close on “hundreds of millions of dollars” in homes. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw ”14x” growth in 2020 and from June 2020 to June 2021, it achieved “10x” growth in terms of the size of its team and number of transactions and revenue, according to CEO and co-founder Adam Pollack. Accept.inc wants to use its new capital to build on that momentum and meet demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollack and Nick Friedman met while in college</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and started building Accept.inc with the goal of &#8220;turning every offer into a cash offer.&#8221; The pair essentially “failed for two years,” half-jokes Pollack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically became an encyclopedia of 1,000 ways the idea of helping people make all-cash offers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team went through Y Combinator in the winter of 2019 and that’s when they created the iLender concept. In the iLender model, the company uses its cash to buy a house for buyers. Once the loan with Accept.inc is ready to close, the company sells back the house to the buyer “at no additional cost or fees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically what we learned through those two years is that you have to vertically integrate all of your core competencies, and you can&#8217;t rely on third parties to own or manage your special sauce for you,” Pollack told TechCrunch. “We also realized that if you&#8217;re going to build a cash offer for anyone who could afford a mortgage, you’ve got to make it a full bona fide cash offer that closes in three days as opposed to a better version of what existed. And you have to own that, and take the risk that comes with it and be comfortable with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of their model, the pair say, is that buyers get to be cash buyers, sellers can close in as little as 32 hours, and agents “get a guaranteed commission check.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is that everyone should have an equal chance at homeownership,” Friedman said. “We not only want to level the playing field, we want to create a new standard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers using Accept.inc win 6-7 times more frequently, the company claims. With its new capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to double its team of 90 and enter new markets outside of its home base of Denver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SignalFire Partner Chris Scoggins believes that Accept.inc is different from other lenders in that its focus is on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “winning the home, not just servicing the loan, with a business model that’s 10x more capital-efficient than other players in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is driven&#8230;to level the playing field for homebuyers who today lose out against all-cash offers from home-flippers and wealthy individuals,” he added. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see an enormous opportunity for Accept.inc to become the backbone of the future of mortgage lending.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no surprise that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we shop, especially when it comes to groceries. Grocery delivery apps experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/grocery-delivery-apps-see-record-downloads-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">a record number of downloads</a> in March 2020, and by the following month, Walmart Grocery (which is now integrated into the Walmart app) surpassed Amazon as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/walmart-grocery-app-sees-record-downloads-amid-covid-19-surpasses-amazon-by-20/">No. 1 shopping app</a> on both Google Play and the App Store. But even as pandemic restrictions have eased, consumers are still using ordering groceries for delivery or pickup <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/11/four-ways-consumer-spending-will-change-once-people-are-vaccinated.html">more frequently</a> than they were pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>As Walmart&#8217;s grocery delivery services have continued to boom, posing competition to companies like Amazon and Instacart, the tech that Walmart uses has expanded too. Today, Walmart shared information about how it&#8217;s training its AI to make smarter substitutions in online grocery orders.</p>
<p>Bringing this technology to grocery delivery isn&#8217;t novel by any means. Last May, Walmart reported how it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/walmart-is-piloting-a-pricier-2-hour-express-grocery-delivery-service/">used to AI to determine eligibility</a> for its Express delivery service, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/walmart-is-piloting-a-pricier-2-hour-express-grocery-delivery-service/">brand new</a> at the time. A year into the United States&#8217; coronavirus outbreak, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/the-algorithms-that-make-instacart-roll">Instacart engineers reported</a> that they crunched &#8220;petabytes daily to predict what will be on grocery shelves and even how long it will take to find parking.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what makes Walmart&#8217;s AI for grocery substitutions unique? According to Srini Venkatesan, an Executive Vice President at Walmart Global Tech, it&#8217;s the sheer quantity of data that Walmart can use to teach its AI. Over 200 million people shop at Walmart in-store and online each week for more than 150,000 different grocery products. The AI uses that data to predict consumer behavior, preferences, and needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tech we built uses deep learning AI to consider hundreds of variables &#8212; size, type, brand, price, aggregate shopper data, individual customer preference, current inventory and more &#8212; in real time to determine the best next available item,&#8221; explained Venkatesan. &#8220;It then preemptively asks the customer to approve the substituted item or let us know they don’t want it, an important signal that’s fed back into our learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of future recommendations.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169273" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169273" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2169273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png 1910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=1536,851 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169273" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Rather than asking a Personal Shopper to make a quick decision about how to substitute for cherry yogurt (do you get a different flavor from the same brand, the same flavor from a more expensive brand, and so on), the AI makes that choice for them. Walmart started developing this algorithm last year, and in the time since, customer acceptance of substitutions has improved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were at about 90% before this algorithm rolled out,&#8221; said Venkatesan. &#8220;We are now around 97% to 98%.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last year, Walmart doubled its number of Personal Shoppers to over 170,000 workers. About 3,750 stores are enabled for order pickup, and 3,000 stores are enabled for delivery, which covers 68% of the population. Earlier this year, Walmart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/walmart-drops-the-35-order-minimum-on-its-2-hour-express-delivery-service/">dropped the $35 order minimum</a> on its Express delivery service, a competitor to Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://primenow.amazon.com/">Prime Now</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW’s Silicon Valley-based venture capital arm is investing in Kodiak Robotics, a company that develops autonomous trucking technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodiak will use the funds to build out a safety case for its self-driving tech stack so it can more quickly commercialize. It will also work on hiring fresh talent and expanding its truck fleet, with a stated goal of at least doubling the number of vehicles it operates each year. The startup currently has 10 trucks in rotation between its commercial route in Texas and its test pilot in Mountain View, California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms of the deal were not disclosed. BMW i Ventures usually invests in companies that can provide solutions to BMW’s current and future business, but Kodiak&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Don Burnette told TechCrunch that BMW’s investment was purely financial and not strategic, meaning there is currently no technical partnership between the two. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new investment comes just a week after tire-maker</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-robotics-snags-investment-partnership-from-bridgestone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bridgestone announced a minority stake in Kodiak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The financials behind that deal were not revealed either. To date, Kodiak has publicly announced $40 million in funding from its Series A, and Burnette says the startup has had several additional investments since then. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burnette also shared the company&#8217;s plans to achieve driverless operations at scale for less than 10% of what Waymo has publicly raised to date – <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/self-driving-car-pioneer-waymo-173456622.html"> $5.7 billion</a> – and less than 25% of TuSimple&#8217;s total existing fundraise –</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about $1.94 billion, including the money it raised through its IPO. That leaves us with a number roughly around $500 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the total amount of money that we think we need to get to driverless, and that’s because we think we’ve been a much more efficient company up until this point, and we will continue to be much more efficient going forward,” said Burnette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BMW i Ventures funding will eventually make up part of Kodiak’s Series B. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this latest investment, the company isn’t trying to further develop its self-driving capabilities or features, but rather it wants to build out its safety case and prove that its system can handle the road with no driver on board, says Burnette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building toward a Level 4 autonomy system, but we still have a driver in the seat that’s actually monitoring our system at all times,” said Burnette. “Today, we are technically a Level 2 system, which is true for just about everybody else out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicles with a human driver supervising operations such as steering, brake and acceleration support, as well as things like lane centering and adaptive cruise control fit under the </span><a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society of Automobile Engineer’s (SAE)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> definition of Level 2 autonomy. Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rct985mGMi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/tusimple-overseas-roadblocks/">TuSimple&#8217;s IPO filing reveals roadblocks for self-driving startups with Chinese ties</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TuSimple&#8217;s IPO filing reveals roadblocks for self-driving startups with Chinese ties&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/tusimple-overseas-roadblocks/embed/#?secret=rct985mGMi" data-secret="rct985mGMi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodiak says it’s made progress. In January it announced its Kodiak Driver achieved “disengagement-free deliveries” (meaning the autonomous system didn&#8217;t have to be switched off for safety reasons) during a commercial route from Dallas to Houston. The company has been running this route out of its Dallas testing and operations facility for two years, and says it’s now achieved a level of maturity where the system can handle anything the highway throws at it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing really complex and advanced maneuvers, not just handling obvious things like merges and cut-ins and heavy traffic, but also more nuanced challenges like identifying vehicles that are pulled over on the side of the road,” said Burnette. “Our system can automatically identify that and then slow down as required by law, or nudge away from that object to give it more space. It can also consider making a lane change if a lane is available, a way to give even more clearance to the stalled vehicle on the side, and this is exactly how humans drive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get to the point where Kodiak can prove its tech is actually safer than a human driver, and thus suitable for operating commercially at scale, the startup has to build up its total miles driven in simulated environments, structured testing on a private closed track, and in real world driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burnette says Kodiak is the only company that doesn’t designate one type of sensor as &#8216;primary,&#8217; and rather takes a comprehensive approach, meaning it’s not a lidar-first or vision-first company. Tesla’s head of AI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tesla-backs-vision-only-approach-to-autonomy-using-powerful-supercomputer/">Andrej Karpathy recently revealed the company’s new supercomputer</a> which takes a vision-only approach, but Burnette fundamentally disagrees with that method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that each of these different modalities have strengths and weaknesses, and our objective is to take advantage of those strengths and cover the weaknesses with other modalities, and so we&#8217;ve created a sensor fusion algorithm that allows us to consider which sensors are advantageous in the moments where they give us the most usable information,” said Burnette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodiak doesn’t use HD mapping either, so its trucks see in real time on the road, which allows the Kodiak Driver to be flexible when it comes to changing road conditions or environments. The system is trained using data collected by Kodiak’s trucks, as well as on scenarios devised by its engineers, and that data is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">auto-labeled using Scale AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is one of the ways Kodiak is able to keep down costs, says Burnette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodiak’s team hails from Google’s original self-driving team, Uber, Lyft and other notable tech companies. Burnette says BMW i Ventures’ investment in the company came after a thorough vetting process in which the firm sent over their autonomous driving experts and dug into the team’s expertise and tech.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliveroo has had another win in the UK courts, beating back an appeal by the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk">IWGB</a> union which has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/19/gig-economy-ruling-deliveroo-riders-equipment-basic-employment-rights">sought for years</a> to challenge the gig platform over couriers&#8217; rights but has continued to fail to overturn the company&#8217;s classification of riders as self-employed.</p>
<p>The latest appeals court ruling is the fourth judgment in the UK that supports Deliveroo&#8217;s contention that its riders are self-employed, following earlier judgments by the Central Arbitration Committee and two at the High Court.</p>
<p>The on-demand food delivery platform operates a different gig model to ride-hailing giant Uber &#8212; which has, by contrast, failed to prevent UK courts from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/"> judging its drivers to be workers not self-employed contractors</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Deliveroo, for example, allows riders to use a substitute to fulfil a shift with only limited restrictions on the practice. And the interpretation of how exactly employment law applies typically hinges on exactly such nuanced details as the level of flexibility being offered to platform workers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/embed/#?secret=Rb2WMf1PHs" data-secret="Rb2WMf1PHs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite a string of legal loses against Deliveroo over the years, the IWGB did not give up its fight. Most recently honing in on the issue of collective bargaining, and seeking to challenge the platform giant&#8217;s stance under the European Convention on Human Rights &#8212; by arguing riders have a legal right to form or join a union.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t had much success with this line of argument against Deliveroo either, though.</p>
<p>And today the UK Court of Appeal dismissed its latest appeal &#8212; ruling that riders do not fall under the scope of the trade union freedom right set out in the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Although the Court did suggest that riders do fall under &#8220;the more general right of freedom of association under article 11 [of the ECoHR]&#8221;.</p>
<p>In conclusion the judges also make a point of noting that other gig economy legal challenges may have a different outcome, writing that: &#8220;It may be thought that those in the gig economy have a particular need of the right to organise as a trade union. So I quite accept that there may be other cases where, on different facts and with a broader range of available arguments, a different result may eventuate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IWGB&#8217;s president, Alex Marshall, seized on this element of the ruling &#8212; commenting in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The judgment recognises that riders would benefit from organising collectively to represent their interests and admits the conclusion reached in the judgment might seem counter intuitive. We will now consider our legal position, but one thing is for sure: We will continue to grow in numbers and fight on the streets until Deliveroo give these key worker heroes the pay and conditions they more than deserve.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In further remarks, Marshall attacked Deliveroo&#8217;s stance toward riders &#8212; claiming it has sought to &#8220;silence&#8221; their voices and deny them opportunities to negotiate better terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Deliveroo couriers have been working on the frontline of the pandemic and whilst being applauded by the public and even declared heroes by their employer, they have been working under increasingly unfair and unsafe working conditions. The reward they have received for their Herculean effort? Deliveroo continuing to invest thousands of pounds in litigation to silence workers&#8217; voices and deny them the opportunity to negotiate better terms and conditions. A recent investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed riders were making as little as £2 per hour. Is this the kind of pay workers would accept if they really were their own boss? It appears that when Deliveroo talk about flexibility and being your own boss, it is talking about the flexibility of choosing when to make poverty wages and work in unsafe conditions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement welcoming the appeal court ruling, Deliveroo claimed the contrary &#8212; saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Today is good news for Deliveroo riders and marks an important milestone. UK courts have now tested and upheld the self-employed status of Deliveroo riders four times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our message to riders is clear. We will continue to back your right to work the way you want and we will continue to listen to you and respond to the things that matter to you most.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Deliveroo’s model offers the genuine flexibility that is only compatible with self-employment, providing riders with the work they tell us they value. Those campaigning to remove riders’ flexibility do not speak for the vast majority of riders and seek to impose a way of working that riders do not want. Deliveroo will continue to campaign for companies like ours to be able to offer the full flexibility of self employment along with greater benefits and more security.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Visa has announced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623006027/en/Visa-To-Acquire-European-Open-Banking-Platform-Tink">plans</a> to acquire <a href="https://tink.com">Tink</a> for €1.8 billion, or $2.15 billion at today’s exchange rate. Tink has been a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interface (API).</p>
<p>Today’s move comes a few months after Visa abandoned its acquisition of <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>, another popular open banking startup. Originally, Visa planned to spend $5.3 billion to acquire the American startup. But the company had to call off the acquisition after running into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">regulatory wall</a>.</p>
<p>Tink offers a single API so that customers can connect to bank accounts from their own apps and services. For instance, you can leverage Tink’s API to access account statements, initiate payments, fetch banking information and refresh this data regularly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While banks and financial institutions now all have to offer open banking interfaces due to EU’s Payment Services Directive PSD2, there’s no single standard. Tink integrates with 3,400 banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>App developers can use the same API call to interact with bank accounts across various financial institutions. As you may have guessed, it greatly simplifies the adoption of open banking features.</p>
<p>300 banks and fintech startups use Tink’s API to access third-party bank information — clients include PayPal, BNP Paribas, American Express and Lydia. Overall, Tink covers 250 million bank customers across Europe.</p>
<p>Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Tink operations should continue as usual after the acquisition. Visa plans to retain the brand and management team.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tink">Crunchbase data</a>, Tink has raised over $300 million from Dawn Capital, Eurazeo, HMI Capital, Insight Partners, PayPal Ventures, Creades, Heartcore Capital and others.</p>
<p>“For the past ten years we have worked relentlessly to build Tink into a leading open banking platform in Europe, and we are incredibly proud of what the whole team at Tink has created together,” Tink co-founder and CEO Daniel Kjellén said in a statement. “We have built something incredible and at the same time we have only scratched the surface.”</p>
<p>“Joining Visa, we will be able to move faster and reach further than ever before. Visa is the perfect partner for the next stage of Tink’s journey, and we are incredibly excited about what this will bring to our employees, customers and for the future of financial services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remittances &#8212; specifically when people in developed countries send money to family or friends in emerging markets &#8212; continues to be a huge lever to help those in more challenging economies survive and improve their lot. Today, a startup that has built a remittance platform that it believes is the most economically sympathetic and useful to the people who use those services the most is announcing some funding to continue growing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.taptapsend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taptap Send</a>, which provides a &#8220;free&#8221; mobile money transfer service from eight countries to 15 others, has raised $13.4 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its scope and the services that it provides to its customers.</p>
<p>The 15 receiver countries include some of the poorest countries in the world that are the hardest to service, plus emerging markets with some of the poorest populations &#8212; DR Congo, Mali, and Madagascar among them &#8212; while the eight originator countries include some of the most common places to which people from these countries emigrate &#8212; United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, France and Italy among them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A was co-led by Canaan Partners and Reid Hoffman, with other unnamed investors also participating.</p>
<p>There is a reason that a lot of companies launch and build services in countries like the U.S. or regions like Western Europe: there is a lot of money there, and specifically consumers and businesses with the kind of income that allows them to invest in new technologies and simply to do more. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that other, less wealthy demographics don&#8217;t exist, or don&#8217;t also need new technology; but building for them is usually less lucrative and more risky.</p>
<p>Taptap Send is among the startups that is trying to approach the promise of tech with this in mind, and with a view to bucking that trend. The company&#8217;s business model works by way of charging no commission or any other fees for transfers, instead making a cut on foreign exchange. It has built its whole tech stack from the ground up and says that this lets it pass on lower exchange rates to its customers, typically lower than others that might be serving the same markets. On top of this, there is an economy of scale principle at play here: having better rates will drive more users, which in turn might not mean better margins but a higher volume of transacting and more returns overall.</p>
<p>The startup is the third entrepreneurial outing for Michael Faye, a development economist who previously worked for the United Nations. Before Taptap Send, Fay founded <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://www.thesegovia.com/">Segovia</a>. In each business, he&#8217;s tried to take the same approach: building financial technology to improve the lot of people living in emerging markets. GiveDirectly (still going strong) did this for philanthropic donations &#8212; it&#8217;s an NGO that sets up donation campaigns where individuals and big businesses can contribute, and people in receiving countries can directly get the funding via mobile money transfers. Segovia (acquired by <a href="https://www.crownagentsbank.com/crown-agents-bank-acquires-segovia-to-strengthen-its-frontier-markets-payment-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Agents Bank</a>) did this for B2B use cases &#8212; it built a mobile-money-transfer-as-a-service, which other money transfer companies could use to power their businesses, by way of an API.</p>
<p>Taptap Send can be thought of as Faye&#8217;s hat trick in the space, taking the bigger concept of remittances used to help people, and building it as a C2C business: aimed at individuals who are sending people &#8220;back home&#8221; money to live on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taptap Send is taking advantage of this structural change in mobile money and other distribution networks to offer what we hope is the fastest and best price service to customers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Taken together, cross-border remittances is a massive market, worth some $540 billion annually when you consider the established channels, with more &#8220;informal&#8221; methods (which can be as analogue as passing money via a person making a trip from one country to the other) estimated to be of nearly the same size. They are also, in fact, more valuable even than foreign direct investment: the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/money-sent-home-workers-now-largest-source-external-financing-low-and-middle-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank has tracked</a> that remittances overtook the money donated by states in 2019.</p>
<p>Mobile technology has played a big part in that, making it easier both to send and receive money, but it&#8217;s also opened the door to a lot of potential exploitation by bad actors, preying on people who might use a service for convenience and not be fully clear on how the actual pricing breaks down.</p>
<p>For that reason, the UN has set a goal for remittance pricing and commissions to be no higher for any company than 3% of the total sent &#8212; one way to ensure that players focus more on volume and less on margins. Taptap send says that it&#8217;s the only company in the space that has publicly committed to that goal (it has yet to hit it, it seems).</p>
<p>The company is not yet disclosing many numbers on its size or customers served but Faye tells me business overall grew 5x in the last year, and is posting a gross profit. &#8220;Even with everything happening you did see this massive increase in digitization,&#8221; he said of Covid-19 and its impact on business. He&#8217;s also undeterred by the vast amounts of competition in the space, which includes not just companies like Western Union and Money Gram but lots and lots of smaller remittance startups like Remitly, World Remit, and many more without the word &#8220;remit&#8221; in their names. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to look at remittance and say it’s crowded, but so was video conferencing before Zoom or social networking before Facebook,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is also why investors are interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company has a nuanced, yet powerful strategy that Michael has put into place to allow [it] to be the lowest-cost provider in every market they enter. As the world rapidly shifts toward digital wallets and e-money, it creates an opportunity for remittance companies to create an even more magical experience by sending funds directly to those wallets,&#8221; noted Brendan Dickinson, a general partner at Canaan. &#8220;Taptap Send gives as much of cost savings as possible to the customer, and as a result, is almost always the cheapest player in the market. All of that makes it economically viable to send smaller remittances – and in doing so, expands the total market and volume of remittances sent. This approach is strongly resonating with customers, as Taptap Send’s massive growth has been 90+% organic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s most recent hype wave seems to be dying down after a spectacular rise, Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto arm is reaffirming its commitment to startups building blockchain projects with a hulking new $2.2 billion crypto fund.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the firm&#8217;s largest vertical-specific fund ever &#8212; by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s 2018 crypto fund ushered in $300 million of LP commitments and its second fund, which it closed in April of last year, clocked in at $515 million. The new multi-billion dollar fund not only showcases how institutional backers are growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies, but also how Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s assets under management have been quickly swelling to compete with other deep-pocketed firms including the ever-prolific Tiger Global.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Andreessen now has some $18.8 billion assets under management.</p>
<p>LPs are likely far less wary to take a chance on crypto after Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s stake in Coinbase equated to some $11.2 billion at the time of the direct listing&#8217;s first trades, though the stock has slid back some 30% in recent months as the crypto market has shrunk.</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s other major crypto bets include NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs which <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11543929116_112520154917&amp;utm_content=477036477316&amp;utm_term=dsa-19959388920&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9ZEFl0gcMnTGBqg_eKHTKkYSNwNoBx1AJA_1tf0hBlqrLIxPSjmrAhoC-I4QAvD_BwE">hit a $7.5 billion valuation</a> this spring. Blockchain infrastructure startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/dfinitys-valuation-soars-to-9-5bn-after-revealing-its-governance-system-and-token-economics/">Dfinity</a> raised at a $9.5 billion valuation this past September. Last year, the firm <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-raise/">led the Series A of Uniswap, </a>which is poised to be a major player in the Ethereum ecosystem. In addition to equity investments, a16z has also made major bets on the currencies themselves.</p>
<p>An earlier report from <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a16z-crypto-fund-balloons-to-2-billion">Newcomer</a> last month reported a16z was targeting a $2 billion crypto fund and that they had already unloaded some of their crypto holdings before most cryptocurrencies took a major dive in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Crypto Fund III will continue to be managed by GPs Chris Dixon and Katie Haun, but the firm has also begun spinning out a more robust management team around the crypto vertical.</p>
<p>Anthony Albanese, who joined the firm last year from the NYSE, has been appointed COO of the division. Tomicah Tillemann, who previously served as a senior advisor to now-President Joe Biden and as chairman of the Global Blockchain Business Council, will be a16z Crypto&#8217;s Global Head of Policy. Rachael Horwitz is also coming aboard as an Operating Partner leading marketing and communications for a16z crypto; leaving Google after a stint as Coinbase&#8217;s first VP of Communications as well.</p>
<p>A couple other folks are also coming on in advisory capacity, including entrepreneur Alex Price and a couple others who will likely be a tad helpful in regulatory maneuverings including Bill Hinman, formerly of the SEC, and Brent McIntosh, who recently served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snowflake changed the conversation for many companies when it comes to the potentials of data warehousing. Now one of the startups that&#8217;s hoping to disrupt the disruptor is announcing a big round of funding to expand its own business.</p>
<p>Firebolt, which has built a new kind of cloud data warehouse that promises much more efficient, and cheaper, analytics around whatever is stored within it, is announcing a major Series B of $127 million on the heels of huge demand for its services.</p>
<p>The company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/firebolt-raises-37m-to-take-on-snowflake-amazon-and-google-with-a-new-approach-to-data-warehousing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only came out of stealth mode in December</a>, is not disclosing its valuation with this round, which brings the total raised by the Israeli company to $164 million. New backers Dawn Capital and K5 Global are in this round, alongside previous backers Zeev Ventures, TLV Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Angular Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nor is it disclosing many details about its customers at the moment. CEO and co-founder Eldad Farkash told me in an interview that most of them are US-based, and that the numbers have grown from the dozen or so that were using Firebolt when it was still in stealth mode (it worked quietly for a couple of years building its product and onboarding customers before finally launching six months ago). They are all migrating from existing data warehousing solutions like Snowflake or BigQuery. In other words, its customers are already cloud-native, big-data companies: it&#8217;s not trying to proselytize on the basic concept but work with those who are already in a specific place as a business.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re not using Snowflake or BigQuery already, we prefer you come back to us later,&#8221; he said. Judging by the size and quick succession of the round, that focus is paying off.</p>
<p>The challenge that Firebolt set out to tackle is that while data warehousing has become a key way for enterprises to analyze, update and manage their big data stores &#8212; after all, your data is only as good as the tools you have to parse it and keep it secure &#8212; typically data warehousing solutions are not efficient, and they can cost a lot of money to maintain.</p>
<p>The challenge was seen first-hand by the three founders of Firebolt, Farkash (CEO), Saar Bitner (COO) and Ariel Yaroshevich (CTO) when they were at a previous company, the business intelligence powerhouse Sisense, where respectively they were one of its co-founders and two members of its founding team. At Sisense, the company continually came up against an issue: When you are dealing in terabytes of data, cloud data warehouses were straining to deliver good performance to power its analytics and other tools, and the only way to potentially continue to mitigate that was by piling on more cloud capacity. And that started to become very expensive.</p>
<p>Firebolt set out to fix that by taking a different approach, re-architecting the concept. As Farkash sees it, while data warehousing has indeed been a big breakthrough in big data, it has started to feel like a dated solution as data troves have grown.</p>
<p>“Data warehouses are solving yesterday’s problem, which was, ‘How do I migrate to the cloud and deal with scale?’ ” he told me back in December. Google’s BigQuery, Amazon’s RedShift and Snowflake as fitting answers for that issue, believes, but “we see Firebolt as the new entrant in that space, with a new take on design on technology. We change the discussion from one of scale to one of speed and efficiency.”</p>
<p>The startup claims that its performance is up to 182 times faster than that of other data warehouses with a SQL-based system that works on academic research that had yet to be applied anywhere, around how to handle data in a lighter way, using new techniques in compression and how data is parsed. Data lakes in turn can be connected with a wider data ecosystem, and what it translates to is a much smaller requirement for cloud capacity. And lower costs.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the company says the concept is gaining a lot of traction with engineers and developers in industries like business intelligence, customer-facing services that need to parse a lot of information to serve information to users in real-time, and back-end data applications. That is proving out what investors suspected would be a shift before the startup even launched, stealthily or otherwise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I’ve been an investor at Firebolt since their Series A round and before they had any paying customers,&#8221; said Oren Zeev of Zeev Ventures. &#8220;What had me invest in Firebolt is mostly the team. A group of highly experienced executives mostly from the big data space who understand the market very well, and the pain organizations are experiencing. In addition, after speaking to a few of my portfolio companies and Firebolt’s initial design partners, it was clear that Firebolt is solving a major pain, so all in all, it was a fairly easy decision. The market in which Firebolt operates is huge if you consider the valuations of Snowflake and Databricks. Even more importantly, it is growing rapidly as the migration from on-premise data warehouse platforms to the cloud is gaining momentum, and as more and more companies rely on data for their operations and are building data applications.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Illumio, a self-styled zero trust unicorn, has closed a $225 million Series F funding round at a $2.75 billion valuation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round was led by Thoma Bravo, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">bought cybersecurity vendor Proofpoint by $12.3 billion</a>, and supported by Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane, and Blue Owl Capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round lands more than two years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/illumio-series-e/">Illumio’s Series E funding round</a> in which it raised $65 million, and fueled speculation of an impending IPO. The company’s founder, Andrew Rubin, still isn’t ready to be pressed on whether the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/meet-5-cybersecurity-unicorns-that-could-ipo-in-2020/">plans to go public</a>, though he told TechCrunch: “If we do our job right, and if we make our customers successful, I&#8217;d like to think that would be part of our journey.”</p>
<p>Illumio’s latest funding round is well-timed. Not only does it come amid a huge rise in successful cyberattacks which show that some of the more traditional cybersecurity measures are no longer working, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">SolarWinds hack</a> in early 2020 to the more recent attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, but it also comes just weeks after President Joe Biden issued an executive order pushing federal agencies to implement significant cybersecurity initiatives, including a zero trust architecture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“And just a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/bidens-cybersecurity-dream-team-takes-shape/">Anne Neuberger</a> [deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity] put out a memo on White House stationary to all of corporate America saying we’re living through a ransomware pandemic, and here’s six things that we’re imploring you to do,&#8221; Rubin says. &#8220;One of them was to segment your network.”</p>
<p>Illumio focuses on protecting data centers and cloud networks through something it calls micro-segmentation, which it claims makes it easier to manage and guard against potential breaches, as well as to contain a breach if one occurs. This zero trust approach to security — a concept centered on the belief that businesses should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters — has never been more important for organizations, according to Illumio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Cyber events are no longer constrained to cyber space,” says Rubin. “That’s why people are finally saying that, after 30 years of relying solely on detection to keep us safe, we cannot rely on it 100% of the time. Zero trust is now becoming the mantra.”</p>
<p>Illumio tells TechCrunch it will use the newly raised funds to make a “huge” investment in its field operations and channel partner network, and to invest in innovation, engineering and its product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The late-stage startup, which was founded in 2013 and is based in California, says more than 10% of Fortune 100 companies — including Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas SA and Salesforce — now use its technology to protect their data centers, networks and other applications.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It saw 100% international growth during the pandemic, and says it&#8217;s also broadening its customer base across more industries. </span></p>
<p>The company has raised more now raised more $550 million from investors include Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and Formation 8.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jio Platforms, run by India’s richest man (Mukesh Ambani), and Google on Thursday unveiled the JioPhone Next, an affordable Android smartphone, as the top Indian telecom operator and the American giant make further push to expand their reach in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The Indian firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">secured $4.5 billion investment from Google</a> (and another $15.5 billion from Facebook and others) last year and shared plans to work on low-cost smartphones, said the JioPhone Next is aimed at helping roughly 300 million users in India who are still on 2G network upgrade their gadget to access faster networks.</p>
<p>The phone, which is &#8220;powered by extremely optimized Android&#8221; mobile operating system, will first launch in India on September 10 ahead of the festive season in the country, and will eventually be made available outside of India, said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, at its annual general meeting Thursday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The JioPhone Next will be an &#8220;ultra-affordable 4G smartphone,&#8221; claimed Ambani, though he didn&#8217;t reveal the price or the hardware specifications of the handset.</p>
<p>In a virtual appearance at Reliance AGM, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company has also entered into a 5G cloud partnership with Jio Platforms. &#8220;It will help more than a billion Indians connect to a faster and better internet, support businesses in their digital transformation, and help Jio build new services in sectors like health, education and more &#8212; laying a foundation for the next phase of India’s digitization,&#8221; said the chief executive of Google, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in India</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the 5G cloud partnership, Google is also winning a major Google Cloud customer in Reliance, said Pichai.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be able take advantage of Google’s AI and machine learning, e-commerce, and demand forecasting offerings. Harnessing the reliability and performance of Google Cloud will enable these businesses to scale up as needed to respond to customer demand,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169666" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169666" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2169666 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=680,338 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169666" class="wp-caption-text">Ambani unveils the JioPhone Next at Reliance&#8217;s Annual General Meeting on Thursday.</p></div></p>
<p>The JioPhone Next will ship with a range of features, including Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages, and even photos.</p>
<p>It also features a &#8220;fast, high-quality camera&#8221; which will support HDR, and the JioPhone Next will be protected by latest Android releases and security updates, Google said, though it didn&#8217;t share the precise duration for this coverage. (Smartphone vendors typically offer security and new Android software support for about two years after the launch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked closely with the Jio team on engineering and product development on useful voice-first features that enable these users to consume content and navigate the phone in their own language, deliver a great camera experience, and get the latest Android feature and security updates,&#8221; Google said in a statement.</p>
<p>Even as most smartphones that ship in India, the second largest market, are priced at $150 or less, customers looking for a smartphone priced under $100 are left with little choice. And that choice has shrunk in recent years.</p>
<p>Research firm Counterpoint told TechCrunch that the sub-$100 smartphones accounted for just 12% of the Indian smartphone market, down from 18% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. Sub-$50 smartphones represented just 0.3% of the entire market in 2020, down from 4.3% in 2018.</p>
<p>Smartphone makers are aware of this whitespace in the market, but have found it incredibly challenging to meet the demand. Some, including Jio Platforms earlier explored a range of feature phones to reach people in small cities and towns of India. Jio Platforms&#8217; KaiOS-powered feature phone, called JioPhone, had amassed 100 million customers as of late February this year.</p>
<p>In a recent report to clients, analysts at UBS said that after factoring in the recent price surge of memory component, any smartphone priced at or under $50 is likely selling at cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this move by Jio will accelerate 2G to 4G migration, we evaluated how interesting this space would be for other smartphone manufacturers, especially key players like Xiaomi. Xiaomi, the unit market leader in smartphones in India, is unlikely to follow up with a $50 smartphone, in our view,&#8221; they wrote in the report, obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Google, too, has previously made several efforts &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/android-one/">$100 Android One smartphones</a> program in 2014 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/googles-lightweight-os-android-go-launches-as-android-oreo-go-edition/">low-resource intensive Android Go</a> operating system in 2017 &#8212; to expand the reach of Android. The company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/kaios-raises-50m-more-hits-100m-handsets-powered-by-its-feature-phone-os/">backed KaiOS</a>, which powers popular feature phones.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next is a &#8220;momentous step in our Android mission for India, and is the first of many that our Android product and engineering teams will embark on in India,&#8221; Google said in a statement. &#8220;We are also actively expanding our engineering teams in India, as we continue to work on finding ways to answer the unique needs of India’s smartphone users.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorbet says it removes the burden of PTO from employers, allowing employees to ‘spend&#8217; it in offers and other types of deals, giving employers far more control over the whole process and the ability to forecast ahead. It does this by buying out PTO liabilities from employees and loading the cash value of the PTO on prepaid Credit Cards. It then refinances these liabilities for employers, hence the forecasting advantage.</p>
<p>Veetahl Eilat-Raichel, founder and CEO, said: “It&#8217;s clear that we’re in the midst of a tectonic shift in employer-employee dynamics and with inbound global interest exceeding our wildest expectations, I had the great privilege of picking and choosing the best investors to help us expand and accelerate. I can think of no better partner than Dovi and the entire Group 11 team to join us, and am thrilled and humbled to have them alongside our already stellar group of investors.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dovi Frances, Founding Partner, Group 11 said: “At Group 11 we pride ourselves in our unique ability to uncover the unicorns of tomorrow. Veetahl and the team did something exceedingly difficult which is to uncover a massive market inefficiency hiding in plain sight. With a $270B market opportunity, it was crystal clear to me this was the time to push forward and not look back.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Wise&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/wise-announces-plans-to-go-public-via-direct-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> that it planned to go public by way of a direct listing on the LSE, today the company made the news formal with a <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/intention-to-float/15030546?showDisclaimer=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a>. The London-based company &#8212; formerly known as TransferWise and primarily in the business of transferring money across different currencies &#8212; with 10 million users said it plans to list in &#8220;early July 2021&#8221; but did not provide further details on pricing of its class A shares, in keeping with how direct listings work. It&#8217;s been reported, however, that the plan is for the valuation to be in the range of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wise-ipo-idUSKBN2BO69F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 billion to $7 billion</a> with the listing.</p>
<p>(Overall, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wise has put in place a dual-class share structure in place with two classes of shares in issue, class A shares and class B shares, in order to support Wise’s focus on its mission as it transitions into the public markets, it noted. Class B shares are not tradeable.)</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Company will not set a price in respect of the class A shares or offer any class A shares in connection with the direct listing,&#8221; it noted in the statement. &#8220;The opening price of the class A shares will be determined in the opening auction on the date of Admission.&#8221; While direct listings have somewhat taken off as a route for tech companies to go public in the U.S. &#8212; a trend spearheaded by another European juggernaut, Spotify &#8212; this is a new turn for the LSE, which <a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/live_cds_-_001_-_17062021_-_revised_initial_opening_auction_arrangements_for_new_admission_-_wise_gb00bl9yr756.pdf." target="_blank" rel="noopener">published its own new rules</a> on the process the same day that Wise announced its plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, we can watch for more details around the public offering, and updates about the company&#8217;s business, will be coming out in a prospectus and other related statements in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Bypassing the big investment banks and the related roadshow of a more conventional listing can be a bold move, one that companies who want to avoid the volatility and commitment of that process might opt to take if they feel they have enough momentum to hit the market directly. Wise in its statement today hinted that there has been some early interest, based on its share <a href="https://wise.com/owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering to Wise customers</a>.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to confirm our plans for a direct listing in London. This process will broaden the ownership of Wise, in support of our mission to move money around the world faster, cheaper and more conveniently,&#8221; said Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, in a note in the statement. &#8220;Since announcing our expected intention to float last week, we’ve had over 60,000 expressions of interest in our customer shareholder programme, OwnWise, which is designed to reward customers who buy Wise shares and stick with us for the longer-term. This direct listing is about further aligning our mission and our shareholder base and I’m enormously proud that customers want to be a part of that.”</p>
<p>Wise has been one of the huge success stories for fintech coming out of Europe, and London &#8212; founded by Estonians Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus, the company&#8217;s been based out of London and has stuck with that even through all the financial turmoil of Brexit. Its 10 million customers currently process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month, which remains its primary business even as it diversifies into newer, related areas of financial services. In its most recent financial year, Wise&#8217;s revenue grew to $586 million, up from $422 million. That represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax, and the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Class B shares will hold 9 votes per share, are strictly non-transferable and, amongst other voting right cancellation events, expire on the fifth anniversary of any listing, the company confirmed. Wise’s shareholders and holders of vested options as at 23 May 2021 are entitled to elect to receive 50% of their class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis (save for Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, who is entitled to elect to receive 100% of his class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis), it added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The voting rights attaching to the class B shares are, subject to certain regulatory approvals, capped so that no shareholder can, by virtue of the class B shares they hold, cast more than one vote less than 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision (save for Kristo Käärmann who, for so long as he is CEO of the Company, will be capped in respect of his class B shares at one vote less than 50% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision and if, at any time, he is not CEO of the Company he will be capped at one below 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision). The class B shares are non-tradeable and will not be listed.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/apple-to-introduce-search-ads-on-app-store-along-with-changes-to-app-review-discovery-and-splits/">launching five years ago</a> in the United States, Apple&#8217;s search advertising service finally arrived in mainland China this week.</p>
<p>The feature, called Apple Search Ads, lets developers bid on an advertising slot based on users&#8217; keyword search in the App Store, similar to how Google search ads work. JPMorgan previously estimated the giant&#8217;s annual ad revenue could <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-advertising/apple-could-raise-annual-ad-income-to-11-billion-by-2025-jpmorgan-idUSKBN1XP17L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">top $11 billion by 2025</a>, though the forecast didn&#8217;t have a breakdown for the search ad business.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“It’s likely that the long delay in launching Search Ads in China was due to Chinese government restrictions on the operation of advertising business in China. It seems that Apple has found a way around this, but at the cost of having to accept payments in foreign currencies and not being able to provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">Search Tab ads</a>,” says Rich Bishop, founder and CEO of AppInChina, a publisher that helps international apps launch in China.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple has itself been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">reining in on personalized advertising</a>, letting users turn off data tracking by apps, a move that will inevitably roil the business models of Facebook and others dependent on third-party data to target ads.</p>
<p>China has historically been a strong market for Apple, but iPhones are increasingly losing their luster as a status symbol in the country with the rise of local offerings like Huawei. In the first quarter, however, Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/">smartphone shipment saw a rebound</a> thanks to Huawei&#8217;s slipping sales and the launch of the iPhone 12 family. The Chinese App Store is another important source of income for Apple.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/v/help/b/docs/apple-advertising-guidelines-for-mainland-china.pdf">five-page guideline</a>, Apple outlines the qualifications for developers targeting ads at mainland Chinese users. There is a stack of industry-specific licenses that advertisers must obtain, which practically excludes most foreign entities from directly advertising in mainland China, as noted in a blog post by <a href="https://www.appinchina.co/apple-search-ads-in-mainland-china">AppInChina.</a></p>
<p>To bid for search ads in China, apps would have to find local partners with all the government approvals in place.</p>
<p>The requirements for apps importing goods into China, for example, include not just a general license to run value-added internet businesses but also registrations with the relevant trade and customs authorities. Apple may even start asking for these permits from apps that simply want to <em>publish </em>in China, wrote AppInChina, as Apple continues to enforce rules set by the Chinese government as evident from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/">crackdown on gaming apps</a>.</p>
