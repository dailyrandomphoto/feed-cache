										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, there was a debate as to whether WeWork was a tech company or more of a real estate play. At first, most people viewed WeWork as a real estate startup disguised as a tech startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as it kept scooping up more and more property, the lines continued to blur. Then we all watched as the company’s valuation plummeted and its IPO plans went up in smoke. Today, WeWork is rumored to be </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306?mod=djemalertNEWS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/wework-could-strike-blank-check-company-merger-deal-in-1st-week-of-march-8211-wsj-62874558"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a SPAC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a $10 valuation, down significantly from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $47 billion it was valued at after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $1 billion in its SoftBank-led Series H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round in January 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann notoriously </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later that year amid allegations of a toxic combination of arrogance and poor management. WeWork has since been very publicly trying to redeem itself and turn around investor &#8212; and public &#8212; perception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Marcelo Claure kicked off a strategic, five-year turnaround plan in earnest in February 2020. That same month, the beleaguered company named a real estate &#8212; not tech &#8212; exec as its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/report-wework-has-a-new-ceo-and-hes-a-real-estate-not-a-tech-exec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new CEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that set tongues wagging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork then also set a target of becoming </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-says-become-free-cash-132630453.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free cash flow positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a year to 2022 as part of its plan, which was aimed at both boosting valuation and winning back investor trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likely saw the demise of competitor Knotel, which ended up </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/a-look-at-how-proptech-startup-knotel-went-from-a-1-6b-valuation-to-filing-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing for bankruptcy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and selling assets to an investor, and realized it needed to learn from some of that company’s mistakes.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WeWork is apparently doing better, not that SoftBank wants you to talk about that&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/wework-is-apparently-doing-better-not-that-softbank-wants-you-to-talk-about-that/embed/#?secret=Jql6taVlu7" data-secret="Jql6taVlu7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is: Has WeWork legitimately turned a corner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the implementation of its turnaround plan, the company says it has exited out of over 100 pre-open or underperforming locations. (It still has </span><a href="https://www.wework.com/locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 800 locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally, according to its website.) WeWork has also narrowed its net loss to $517 million in Q3 2020 from $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, revenue has taken a hit, presumably due to the impact of the coronavirus. Revenue slumped to $811 million the 2020 third quarter, compared with $934 million in Q3 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presented WeWork with challenges, but also &#8212; some might say &#8212; opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people being forced to work from home and avoiding others during the work day, the office space in general struggled. WeWork either had to adapt, or potentially deal with a bigger blow to its valuation and bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork’s dilemma is similar to  those of real estate companies around the world. With so many companies shifting to remote work not just temporarily, but also permanently, landlords everywhere have had to adjust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, as McKinsey </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-effect-of-government-stimulus-on-commercial-real-estate-amid-covid-19#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all landlords have been forced to be more flexible and restructure tenant leases. So in effect, anyone operating commercial real estate space has had to become more flexible, just as WeWork has.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, WeWork has taken a few steps to adapt. For one, it realized its membership-only plan was not going to work anymore, and a dip in membership was evidence of that. So, it worked to open its buildings to more people through new </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/wework-but-make-it-uber-b428fbe2-7fc7-4d4e-aaba-8c8aa2be537d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/24/wework-coworking-coronavirus-office-commercial-real-estate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options. The goal was to give people who were weary of working out of their own homes a place to go, say one day a week, to work. WeWork also saw an opportunity to work with companies to offer up its office space as a perk via an All Access offering, as well as with universities that wanted to give their students an alternative place to study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgetown did a pretty unique partnership with WeWork to have one of its locations serve as “their replacement library and common space.” And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies like Brandwatch have recently shifted from leveraging WeWork&#8217;s traditional spaces to instead offer employees access to WeWork locations around the globe via All Access passes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork has also launched new product features. At the beginning of the year, the company launched </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ability to book space on the weekend and outside of business hours. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Report: WeWork has a new CEO and he&#8217;s a real estate &#8212; not a tech &#8212; exec&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/report-wework-has-a-new-ceo-and-hes-a-real-estate-not-a-tech-exec/embed/#?secret=20iYyOqggR" data-secret="20iYyOqggR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The unbundling of space</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Prabhdeep Singh, WeWork’s global head of marketplace, who is overseeing the new products and also spearheading WeWork’s shift online, to learn more about the company’s new strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve essentially done is unbundle our space,” he said. “It used to be that the only way to enjoy our spaces was via a bundled subscription product and monthly memberships. But we realized with COVID, the world was shifting, and to open up our platform to a broader group of people and make it as flexible as humanly possible. So they can now book a room for a half hour or get a day pass, for example. The use cases are so wide.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since On Demand launched as a pilot in New York City in August 2020, demand has steadily been climbing, according to Singh. So far, reservations are up by 65% &#8212; and revenue up by 70% &#8212; over the 2020 fourth quarter. But of course, it’s still early and they were starting from a small base. Nearly two-thirds of On Demand reservations are made by repeat customers, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last year and a half, we’ve been really figuring out what things we want to focus on what things we don’t,” Singh said. “As a flexible space provider, we are looking at where the world is going. And while we’re a small part of the whole commercial office space industry, we are working to use technology to enable a flexible workspace experience via a great app and the digitization of our spaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, things seem to be looking up some. In February, WeWork says it had nearly twice as many active users compared to January. Also, people apparently like having the option to come in at off hours. Weekend bookings now account for an estimated 14.5% of total bookings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly double as many existing members purchased All Access passes in February 2020 compared to January to complement their existing private office space during COVID, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning of the COVID-19, WeWork saw a</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/15/success/wework-ceo-future-work/index.html?utm_term=PRV-160019770518545e993ef75ca&amp;utm_source=Work+Transformed+September+15&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=243358_1600197705203&amp;bt_ee_preview=NcSrJnseMIyhSYOHhgpWJBhg8%2Bguk%2FDdFMfL84t5SciDGnr%2BQdbNwGGFmVGUuyiT&amp;bt_ts_preview=1600197705203"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">higher departure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) than of its enterprise members, partially due to the nature of their businesses and the need to more immediately manage cash flow, the company said. But in the third quarter of 2020, SMB desk sales were up 50% over the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, throughout the pandemic, WeWork has seen its enterprise segment grow at nearly double the rate of its SMBs, now making up over half of the company’s total membership base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s slowing down investing in new real estate assets in certain markets, it is still working to “right-size” its portfolio via exits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, when it comes to its finances, as of March 2, WeWork said its </span><a href="https://www.boerse-berlin.com/index.php/Bonds?isin=USU96217AA99"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were trading at the highest point since the summer of 2019, when the company failed to go public. That’s way up from a 52-week low of about 28%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At ~92% for a ~10% yield, the creditor sentiment is clearly positive and a testament to the overall market&#8217;s belief that WeWork&#8217;s flexible workspace product has a viable future in the future of real estate,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last March, WeWork’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading at 43 cents on the dollar and S&amp;P Global had lowered WeWork’s credit rating further into junk territory and put the company on watch for further downgrades, reported </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/03/26/wework-mounts-charm-offensive-as-bondholders-run-for-the-exits/?sh=3dcafcfe28dd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company is not done adapting. Singh told TechCrunch that to make WeWork’s value proposition even stronger, it’s working to offer a “business in a box.” Late last year, WeWork partnered with a number of companies to offer SMBs and startups, for example, services such as payroll, healthcare and business insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people that come to WeWork are growing businesses,” Singh said. “So while we’ve stuck with our core business services, we’re working to offer more, as in a real suite of HR services that might be complex and expensive for a small business to manage on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working to be able to offer its On Demand product globally so that people can opt to work out of a WeWork space from any of its locations around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we are in the largest work from home experiment,” Singh said. “I think we’re about to shift to the largest return to work experiment ever. We are just going to be very well positioned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company appears to be trying to become a more sophisticated real estate company that may not be as flashy as the one of the Adam Neumann era, but more stable and more in demand. But is it trying to do too much, too fast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see how it all goes.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook will soon label all posts discussing the coronavirus vaccination with a pointer to official information about COVID-19, it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">said today</a>.</p>
<p>It also revealed it has implemented some new &#8220;temporary&#8221; measures aimed at limiting the spread of vaccine misinformation/combating vaccine hesitancy &#8212; saying it&#8217;s reducing the distribution of content from users that have violated its <a href="https://www.intern.facebook.com/help/230764881494641">policies on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation</a>; or &#8220;that have repeatedly shared content debunked as False or Altered by our third-party fact-checking partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also reducing distribution of any COVID-19 or vaccine content that fact-checking partners have rated as “Missing Context”, per the blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While admins for groups with admins or members who have violated its COVID-19 policies will also be required to temporarily approve all posts within their group, it said. (It&#8217;s not clear what happens if a group only has one admin and they have violated its policies.)</p>
<p>Facebook will also &#8220;further elevate information from authoritative sources when people seek information about COVID-19 or vaccines&#8221;, it added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why users who repeatedly violate Facebook&#8217;s COVID-19 policies do not face at least a period of suspension. (We&#8217;ve asked the company for clarity on its policies.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re continuing to expand our efforts to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation by adding labels to Facebook and Instagram posts that discuss the vaccines,&#8221; Facebook said in the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">Newsroom post</a> today.</p>
<p>&#8220;These labels contain credible information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization. For example, we’re adding a label on posts that discuss the safety of COVID-19 vaccines that notes COVID-19 vaccines go through tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incoming COVID-19 information labels are rolling out globally in English, Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, Arabic and French (with additional languages touted &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221;), per Facebook.</p>
<p>As well as soon rolling out labels &#8220;on all posts generally about COVID-19 vaccines&#8221; &#8212; pointing users to its COVID-19 Information Center &#8212; Facebook said it would add additional &#8220;targeted&#8221; labels about &#8220;COVID-19 vaccine subtopics&#8221;. So it sounds like it may respond directly to specific anti-vaxxer misinformation it&#8217;s seeing spreading on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also add an additional screen when someone goes to share a post on Facebook and Instagram with an informational COVID-19 vaccine label. It will provide more information so people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share,&#8221; Facebook added.</p>
<p>The moves follow revelations that an internal Facebook study of vaccine hesitancy &#8212; which was reported on by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/14/facebook-vaccine-hesistancy-qanon/">Washington Post</a> yesterday after it obtained documents on the large-scale internal research effort &#8212; found a small number of US users are responsible for driving most of the content that&#8217;s hesitant about getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just 10 out of the 638 population segments [Facebook&#8217;s study divided US users into] contained 50 percent of all vaccine hesitancy content on the platform,&#8221; the Post reported. &#8220;And in the population segment with the most vaccine hesitancy, just 111 users contributed half of all vaccine hesitant content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/">MIT Technology Review</a> also published a deep-dive article probing Facebook&#8217;s approach to interrogating, via an internal &#8216;Responsible AI&#8217; team, the impacts of AI-fuelled content distribution &#8212; which accused the company of prioritizing growth and engagement and neglecting the issue of toxic misinformation (and the individual and societal harms that can flow from algorithmic content choices which amplify lies and hate speech).</p>
<p>In the case of COVID-19, lies being spread about vaccination safety or efficacy present a clear and present danger to public health. And Facebook&#8217;s PR machine does appear to have, tardily, recognized the extent of the reputational risk it&#8217;s facing if it&#8217;s platform is associated with driving vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>To wit: Also today it&#8217;s announced the launch of a global COVID-19 education drive that it says it hopes will bring 50M people &#8220;closer to getting vaccinated&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By working closely with national and global health authorities and using our scale to reach people quickly, we’re doing our part to help people get credible information, get vaccinated and come back together safely,&#8221; Facebook writes in the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">Newsroom post</a> that links directly to a Facebook post by founder Mark Zuckerberg also trailing the new measures, including the launch of a tool that will show U.S. Facebook users where they can get vaccinated and provide them with a link to make an appointment.</p>
<p>Facebook said it plans to expand the tool to other countries as global vaccine availability steps up.</p>

<p>Facebook has further announced that the COVID-19 information portal it launched in the Facebook app in March last year which points users to &#8220;the latest information about the virus from local health ministries and the World Health Organization&#8221; is finally being brought to Instagram.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Facebook hadn&#8217;t already launched the portal on Instagram. But it&#8217;s decided to double down on fighting bad speech (related to vaccines) with better speech &#8212; saying Instagram users will get new stickers they can add to their Instagram Stories &#8220;so people can inspire others to get vaccinated when it becomes available to them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other moves being trailed in Facebook&#8217;s crisis PR blitz today it has touted &#8220;new data and insights&#8221; on vaccine attitudes being made available to public officials via COVID-19 dashboards and maps it was already offering (the data is collected by Facebook&#8217;s Data for Good partners for the effort at Carnegie Mellon University and University of Maryland as part of the <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/symptomsurvey/">COVID-19 Symptom Survey</a>).</p>
<p>Albeit, it doesn&#8217;t specify what new information is being added there (or why now).</p>
<p>Also today it said it&#8217;s &#8220;making it easy to track how COVID-19 vaccine information is being spread on social media through <a href="https://apps.crowdtangle.com/public-hub/covid19">CrowdTangle’s COVID-19 Live Displays</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Publishers, global aid organizations, journalists and others can access real-time, global streams of vaccine-related posts on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit in 34 languages. CrowdTangle also offers Live Displays for 104 countries and all 50 states in the US to help aid organizations and journalists track posts and trends at a regional level as well,&#8221; Facebook added, again without offering any context on why it hadn&#8217;t made it easier to use this tool to track vaccine information spread before.</p>
<p>Its blog post also touts &#8220;new&#8221; partnerships with health authorities and governments on vaccine registration &#8212; while trumpeting the ~3BN messages it says have already been sent &#8220;by governments, nonprofits and international organizations to citizens through official WhatsApp chatbots on COVID-19&#8221;. (As WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted there is no simple way to quantify how many vaccine misinformation messages have been sent via the same platform.)</p>
<p>Per Facebook, it&#8217;s now &#8220;working directly with health authorities and governments to get people registered for vaccinations&#8221; (such as in the city and province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is using WhatsApp as the official channel to send notifications to citizens when it’s their turn to receive the vaccine).</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have partnered with ministries of health and health-focused organizations in more than 170 countries by providing free ads, enabling partners to share their own public health guidance on COVID-19 and information about the COVID-19 vaccine,&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s PR adds in a section of the post which it&#8217;s titled &#8220;amplifying credible health information and resources from experts&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of reports that <a href="http://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> was raising yet more money, the payments giant has now confirmed the details. The company has closed in on another $600 million, at a valuation of $95 billion.</p>
<p>Stripe said it will use the funding to expand its business in Europe, with a focus on its European HQ, and also to beef up its global payments and treasury network.</p>
<p>“We’re investing a ton more in Europe this year, particularly in Ireland,” said John Collison, President and co-founder of Stripe, in a statement. “Whether in fintech, mobility, retail or SaaS, the growth opportunity for the European digital economy is immense.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stripe said the financing included backing from two major insurance players. Allianz, via its Allianz X fund, and Axa are in the round, along with Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Sequoia Capital, and an investor from the founders&#8217; home country, Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).</p>
<p>The insurance angle may point to which direction the company is looking to go next. After all, fintech and insurance are closely aligned.</p>
<p>“Stripe is an accelerator of global economic growth and a leader in sustainable finance. We are convinced that, despite making great progress over the last 10 years, most of Stripe’s success is yet to come” said Conor O&#8217;Kelly, CEO of NTMA in a statement. “We’re delighted to back Ireland’s and Europe’s most prominent success story, and, in doing so, to help millions of other ambitious companies become more competitive in the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big round, rising valuation, and growing cap table will inevitably lead to questions around where the company is standing with regards to its next steps, and whether that will include a public listing. Stripe has long kept its cards to its chest when it comes to user numbers, revenues, and profit and those details, once again, are not being disclosed with the news today, and nor has it made any comments on IPO plans.</p>
<p>Notably, the confirmation of the news today is at a lower valuation than the valuation Stripe was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valuing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=7721c7554786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> trading at on the secondary market, which was $115 billion; and the round that closed at a $95 billion valuation was also rumored to be coming in at a higher number, over $100 billion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether those numbers were never accurate, or if Covid had an impact on pricing, or if European investors simply drove a hard bargain.</p>
<p>The focus on growing in Europe also puts the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peter-barron-376b16a_some-personal-news-next-week-ill-be-joining-activity-6770749267343626240-E1K2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring of Peter Barron</a> &#8212; the former EMEA VP of communications for Google and a former journalist &#8212; into some context.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by John and his brother Patrick Collison (the CEO), Stripe is one of a wave of commerce startups that saw the value of building a simple way for developers to integrate payments into any app or site by way of a few lines of code, at a time when digital and specifically online payments were starting to take off.</p>
<p>Behind that code, the company had done all the hard work of integrating all the different and complex pieces needed to make payments work both in countries and across borders.Over the years, the company has built out a bigger platform around that, a suite of services to position itself as a one-stop shop not just for helping businesses run all of the commercial aspects of their operations, including incorporation, managing fraud, managing cashflow and more.</p>
<p>Within that, Stripe has built out a decent footprint in Europe, with the region accounting for 31 of the 42 countries where it has customers today. While Stripe may have had its start and early traction providing payments infrastructure for startups (and especially small, new startups), today that list includes a lot of big names, too. In Europe, customers include Axel Springer, Jaguar Land Rover, Maersk, Metro, Mountain Warehouse and Waitrose, alongside Deliveroo (UK), Doctolib (France), Glofox (Ireland), Klarna (Sweden), ManoMano (France), N26 (Germany), UiPath (Romania) and Vinted (Lithuania).</p>
<p>Even with heavy competition in payments and adjacent services, there is a huge opportunity for more growth. Stripe says that in the wake of Covid and the rise of people shopping considerably more across the web and apps rather than in person, currently some 14% of commerce happens online, a big shift considering that just a year ago it was about 10%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome to Week in Review.</p>
<p>Last week, I talked a bit about NFTs and their impact on artists. If you&#8217;re inundated with NFT talk just take one quick look at this story I wrote this week about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">the $69 million sale of Beeple&#8217;s photo collage</a>. This hype cycle is probably all the result of crypto folks talking each other up and buying each other&#8217;s stuff, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be lasting impacts. That said, I would imagine we&#8217;re pretty close to the peak of this wave, with a larger one down the road after things cool off a bit. I&#8217;ve been wrong before though&#8230;</p>
<p>This week, I&#8217;m interested in a quick look at what your kids have been talking about all these years. Yes, Roblox.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>Roblox went public on the New York Stock Exchange this week, scoring a $38 billion market cap after its first couple days of trading.</p>
<p>Investors rallied around the idea that Roblox is one of the most valuable gaming companies in existence. More than Unity, Zynga, Take-Two, even gaming giant Electronic Arts. It&#8217;s still got a ways to go to take down Microsoft, Sony or Apple though&#8230; The now-public company is so freaking huge because investors believe the company has tapped into something that none of the others have, a true interconnected creative marketplace where gamers can evolve alongside an evolving library of experiences that all share the same DNA (and in-game currency).</p>
<p>The gaming industry has entered a very democratic stride as cross-play tears down some of the walls of gaming&#8217;s platform dynamics. Each hardware platform that operates an app store of their own still has the keys to a kingdom, but it&#8217;s a shifting world with uncertainty ahead. While massive publishers have tapped cloud gaming as the trend that will string their blockbuster franchises together, they all wish they were in Roblox&#8217;s position. The gaming industry has seen plenty of Goliath&#8217;s in its day, but for every major MMO to strike it rich, it&#8217;s still just another winner in a field of disparate hits with no connective tissue.</p>
<p>Roblox is different, and while many of us still have the aged vision of the image above: a bunch of rudimentary Minecraft/Playmobile-looking mini-games, Roblox&#8217;s game creation tools are advancing quickly and developers are building photorealistic games that are wider in ambition and scope than before. As the company levels-up the age range it appeals to &#8212; both by holding its grasp on aging gamers on its platform and using souped-up titles to appeal to a new-generation &#8212; there&#8217;s a wholly unique platform opportunity here: the chance to have the longevity of an app store but with the social base layer that today&#8217;s cacophony of titles have never shared.</p>
<p>Whether or not Roblox is the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; that folks in the gaming world have been hyping, it certainly looks more like it than any other modern gaming company does.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/apple-security-updates-iphone-ipad-mac-watch/">Apple releases some important security patches</a><br />
</b>It was honestly a pretty low-key week of tech news, I&#8217;ll admit, but folks in the security world might not totally buy that characterization. This week, Apple released some critical updates for its devices, fixing a Safari vulnerability that could allow attackers to run malicious code on a user&#8217;s unpatched devices. Update your stuff, y&#8217;all.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/tiktok-rolls-out-new-commenting-features-aimed-at-preventing-bullying/">TikTok gets proactive on online bullying</a><br />
</b>New social media platforms have had the benefit of seeing the easy L&#8217;s that Facebook teed itself up for. For TikTok, its China connection means that there&#8217;s less room for error when it comes to easily avoidable losses. The team announced some new anti-bullying features aimed at cutting down on toxicity in comment feeds.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/dropbox-to-acquire-secure-document-sharing-startup-docsend-for-165m/"><b>Dropbox buys DocSend</b></a><br />
Cloud storage giants are probably in need of a little reinvention, the enterprise software boom of the pandemic has seemed to create mind-blowing amounts of value for every SaaS company except these players. This week, Dropbox made a relatively big bet on document sharing startup DocSend. It&#8217;s seemingly a pretty natural fit for them, but can they turn in into a bigger opportunity?</p>

As graphics cards and consoles have hit new levels of power, games have had to satisfy desired for more details and complexity. It takes a wild amount of time to create 3D assets with that complexity so plenty of game developers have leaned on photogrammetry which turns a series of photos or scans of a real world object or environment into a 3D model. This week, Epic Games bought one of the better known software makers in this space, called <em>Capturing Reality,</em> with the aim of integrating the tech into future versions of their game engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/"><b>Twitter Spaces launches publicly next month</b></a><br />
I&#8217;ve spent some more time with Twitter Spaces this week and am growing convinced that it has a substantial chance to kneecap Clubhouse&#8217;s growth. Twitter is notoriously slow to roll out products, but it seems they&#8217;ve been hitting the gas on Spaces, announcing this week that it will be available widely by next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldberg-want-to-be-your-weed-dealer/"><b>Seth Rogen starts a weed company</b></a><br />
There&#8217;s a lot of money in startups, there&#8217;s really never been a better time to get capital for a project&#8230; if you know the right people and have the right kind of expertise. Seth Rogen and weed are a pretty solid mental combo and him starting a weed company shouldn&#8217;t be a big shock.</p>

&#8220;Another day brings another public debut of a multibillion-dollar company that performed well out of the gate.This time it’s Coupang, whose shares are currently up just over 46% to more than $51 <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">after pricing at $35</a>, $1 above the South Korean e-commerce giant’s IPO price range. Raising one’s range and then pricing above it only to see the public markets take the new equity higher is somewhat par for the course when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">most successful recent debuts</a>, to which we can add Coupang.&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has delivered another 60 Starlink satellites to orbit — meaning it has sent 180 in total to join its 1,000+ strong constellation in the past two weeks alone. Today&#8217;s launch also set a record for SpaceX for its Falcon 9 rocket reusability program, since it was the ninth flight and ninth landing for this particular first-stage booster.</p>
<p>The booster was used previously on a variety of missions, including five prior Starlink launches, as well as the Demo-1 mission for the company&#8217;s Crew Dragon capsule, which was the uncrewed test flight that proved it would work as intended from launch all the way to docking with the International Space Station and then returning back to Earth.</p>
<p>SpaceX set its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/">prior reusability record in January this year</a> – another Starlink launch – using this very same refurbished first stage, which had just flown in December of last year before that. SpaceX not only wants to continue to show that it can re-fly these boosters more and more times, but also that it can turn them around quickly for their next mission, since both speed and volume will have a significant impact on launch costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX delivers 60 more Starlink satellites in first launch of 2021, and sets new Falcon 9 rocket reusability record&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/embed/#?secret=FeR7WuHAFl" data-secret="FeR7WuHAFl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rocket reuse is of particular importance when it comes to these Starlink missions, which are happening with increasing frequency as SpaceX pushes to expand the availability of its Starlink broadband internet service globally. As mentioned, this is the third launch of 60 satellites for the constellation in just 10 days — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spacex-launches-60-new-starlink-satellites-just-one-week-after-the-last-batch/">the most recent launch happened just Thursday</a>, and the first of this trio took place the Thursday before that.</p>
<p>From here, expect SpaceX to just continue to launch at roughly this pace for the next little while, since it has two more planned Starlink launches before March is over, including one tentatively set for next Sunday. As the company is its own customer for these missions, it&#8217;s eating the cost of the launches (at least until Starlink starts operating beyond its current beta and bringing in more revenue) so re-flying boosters is a good way to help mitigate the overall spend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Every quarter we dig into the venture capital market’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/venture-capital-is-going-to-get-even-bigger-faster-and-more-expensive-this-year/">global</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">national</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">sector-based results</a> to get a feel for what the temperature of the private market is at that point in time. These imperfect snapshots are useful. But sometimes, it’s better to focus on a single story to show what’s really going on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a>. I covered AgentSync for the first time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">last August</a>, when the API-focused insurtech player raised a $4.4 million seed round. It’s a neat company, helping others track the eligibility of individual brokers in the market. It’s a big space, and the startup was showing rapid initial traction in the form of $1.9 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>But then AgentSync <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">raised again in December</a>, sharing at the time of its $6.4 million round that the valuation cap had grown by 4x since its last round. And that it had seen 4x revenue growth since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>All that must sound pretty pedestrian; a quickly-growing software company raising two rounds? Quelle surprise.</p>
<p>But then AgentSync raised <em>again</em> this week, with another grip of datapoints. Becca Szkutak and Alex Konrad’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/midastouch/#45c2bb1c7c09">Midas Touch newsletter</a> reported the sheaf of data, and The Exchange confirmed the numbers with AgentSync CEO Niji Sabharwal. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Present-day revenues of less than $10 million, but with ARR growing by 6x in 2020 after 10x expansion in 2019.</li>
<li aria-level="1">No customer churn to date.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Its $25 million Series A valued the company at $220 million, which Konrad and Szkutak describe as “exactly 10x AgentSync’s valuation from eight months ago.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That means AgentSync was worth $22 million when it raised $4.4 million, and the December round was raised at a cap of around $80 million. Fun.</p>
<p>Back to our original point, the big datasets can provide useful you-are-here guidance for the sector, but it’s stories like AgentSync that I think better show what the market is really like today for hot startups. It’s bonkers fast and, even more, often backed up by material growth.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabharwal also told The Exchange that his company has closed another $1 million in ARR since the term sheet. So its multiples are contracting even before it shared its news. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021, there you have it.</span></p>
<h2>Meet Conscience.vc</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this week I got to meet </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arianadthacker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariana Thacker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is building a venture capital fund. Her route to her own venture shop included stops at Rhapsody Venture Partners, and some time at Predictive VC. Now she’s working on </span><a href="https://conscience.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conscience.vc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or perhaps just Conscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new fund will invest in companies worth less than $15 million, have some form of consumer-facing business model (B2B and B2B2C are both fine, she said), and something to do with science, be it a patentable technology or other sort of IP. Why the science focus? It’s Thacker’s background, thanks to her background in chemical engineering and time as a facilities engineer for a joint Exxon-Shell project. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hOvE4RDYgY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/">5 takeaways from the Coursera IPO filing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 takeaways from the Coursera IPO filing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/embed/#?secret=hOvE4RDYgY" data-secret="hOvE4RDYgY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>All that’s neat and interesting, but as we cover zero new-fund announcements on The Exchange and almost never mini-profile VCs, why break out of the pattern? Because unlike nearly everyone in her profession, Thacker was super upfront with data and metrics.</p>
<p>Heck, in her first email she included a list of her investments across different capital vehicles with actual information about the deals. And then she shared more material on different investments and the like. Imagine if more VCs shared more of their stuff? That would rock.</p>
<p>Conscience had its first close in mid-January, though more capital might land before she wraps up the fundraising process. She’s reached $4 million to $5 million in commits, with a cap of $10 million on the fund. And, she told The Exchange, she didn’t know a single LP before last summer and only secured an anchor investor last October.</p>
<p>Let’s see what Thacker gets done. But at a minimum I think she’ll be willing to be somewhat transparent as she invests from her first fund. That alone will command more attention from these pages than most micro-funds could ever manage.</p>
<h2>A whole bunch of other important shit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week was super busy, so I missed a host of things that I would have otherwise liked to have written about. Here they are in no particular order:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://falconx.io/">FalconX</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that powers crypto-trading on other platforms, raised $50 million this week. The round comes after the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/falconx-raises-17m-to-power-its-crypto-trading-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $17 million last May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I wrote about that here. Tiger Global led the round, natch, as it has led </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1369642298326269955"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly every round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>FalconX</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round matters as the company grew from what we presume was a modest trading and revenue base into something much larger. Per the company, in “less than a year” the company’s “trading volume” grew by 12x and its “net revenue” grew 46x. That’s a lot. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://privacera.com/">Privacera</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also raised $50 million this week. Insight Partners led the round. The deal caught my eye as it promised a “cloud-based data governance and security solution.” That reminded me of </span><a href="https://www.skyflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skyflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly-growing startup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I thought might have a similar product. </span><strong>Privacera</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/balaji_blog?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balaji Ganesan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> politely corrected my confusion in an email saying that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Skyflow is like a vault for customer data. They replace customer data with tokens. Our focus is on data governance, so it is broader. We don&#8217;t store customer data within our solution.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fair enough. It’s still an interesting space.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s </span><strong><a href="https://www.woflow.com/">Woflow</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/11/merchant-data-platform-woflow-emerges-from-stealth-with-3-5m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VentureBeat actually got to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I could. I chatted with the company this week, but sadly have more notes than open word count today. So let it suffice to say that the company’s model of selling structured merchant data is super cool. And the fact that it has linked up with customers in its first vertical (restaurants) like DoorDash is impressive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its round was led by Craft Ventures, a firm that has been pretty damn active in the API-powered startup landscape in recent months. More to come on </span><strong>Woflow</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">Spending millions for a digital work of art</a> that could be screenshotted feels similar to traipsing around a strip of concrete as a tourist activity. The optics don’t make immediate sense — there’s hardly any appeal in something as accessible as a Google image or street.</p>
<p>That’s my best bet at explaining at least some of the confusion around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">the explosive rise of NFTs, or nonfungible tokens</a>. The token, minted on the blockchain, can give digital assets a unique signifier. In other words, anyone could screenshot a piece of art, but only one of us will own the true, original piece of art. This context is part of the reason why Beeple, a digital artist, had his artwork sold for $69 million just a few days ago.</p>
<p>The reason this topic is coming up in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/startups-weekly/">Startups Weekly</a> newsletter is because of the impact it could have on the cryptocurrency movement, of which there is a growing tide of early-stage and late-stage startups. The popularization of NFTs, as I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">argued in Equity</a> this week, could be what makes cryptocurrency finally palpable to the average human — beside the average bitcoin hoarder. Platforms that sell NFTs usually need you to use cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum) to purchase anything. Mix that with the fact that humans have an innate desire to own, protect and immortalize their assets, and you might have the perfect storm. Beeple, a digital artist, made $69 million for his work, and this isn’t just a big financing event, it’s a signal that crypto enthusiasts and crypto assets are getting to an inescapable spot in public dialogue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Ownership as a way for a decentralized network to become mainstream is its own meta conversation, and I’ll be clear that the blockchain and NFTs have a long way to go before they are truly equitable, accessible and hit their stride. But, it’s hard to not to let your mind wander about the opportunities here.</p>
<p>It’s more than a screenshot, it’s about the potential of pixels having more meaning than they ever did before. And it’s more than a strip of concrete, it’s the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Finding exclusive aspects of accessible things in our lives is compelling to a consumer and could be great for creators.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll discuss Coupang’s competitive industrial edge, a startup hoping to be the Nasdaq for revenue and Google’s brains fighting Google itself. As always, you can follow me on Twitter<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> @nmasc_</a> for my thoughts throughout the week and tech news.</p>
<h2><strong>The Amazon of South Korea goes public </strong></h2>
<p>Coupang, which some describe as the Amazon of South Korea, priced and started trading this week on the public markets. At one point on Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">the company was valued at $92 billion. </a></p>

</ul>
<p>Here’s what to know: When Coupang first launched, it found that South Korea had an absence of third-party logistics companies similar to UPS or FedEx in the United States. Now, it wasn’t without competition, but it did have an opportunity to build an end-to-end logistics company that is now worth a boatload of money.</p>

<h2><strong>The Nasdaq for Revenue</strong></h2>
<p>Pipe has a compelling narrative: It’s anti-VC, doesn’t like naming its rounds and says its goal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/">to be the Nasdaq for revenue. </a>The goal since it started was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by connecting them to investors that would pay a rate for the annual value of those contracts. It turns monthly recurring revenue into annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know: The startup raised $50 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/">in a financing event this week</a>.

<p>When Mike Morrison left his hometown of Fredericton, New Brunswick, for Calgary, Alberta, he assumed he’d never go back except to visit.</p>
<p>Morrison was following a well-trodden path of Atlantic Canadians heading west to find work rom which few returned. During the mid-aughts, Alberta was booming thanks to the high price of oil. To Morrison, migrating west seemed an easy choice. “If I stayed, my options were to be a supply teacher or work in a call center.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When he arrived in Alberta, Morrison worked three jobs. During his free time, he started a blog to tell his friends back home about his life out west, and also to recommend TV shows. Slowly,<a href="https://mikesbloggityblog.com/"> Mike’s Bloggity Blog</a> became one of Canada’s premier entertainment sites, and Morrison found himself with a local newspaper column as well as regular television and radio appearances. He then started<a href="https://socialathome.ca/"> Social West</a>, a Calgary-based digital marketing conference that, before long, expanded to three cities. His identity and public persona were intertwined with his adopted city.</p>
<p>“For a while, I would tell people that I was being paid to be a professional Calgarian.” Then, in 2021, Morrison left Calgary for Halifax, Nova Scotia, back east.</p>
<p>Morrison and his partner are part of a wave of skilled young people reversing Canada’s natural current of internal migration. In doing so, they’re participating in an economic revival that could change the destiny of the depressed Atlantic region.</p>
<p>When they return, young people like Morrison are finding that Atlantic Canadians have quietly built a robust startup ecosystem that has resulted in a dozen acquisitions to companies like IBM and Salesforce, the sum of which likely surpasses $5 billion in cash and stock.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Canada story may provide a blueprint for other rural regions looking to take advantage of the decentralizing impact of COVID-19 to swap resource-based economies for the knowledge economy.</p>
<p>If you’ve never thought of Atlantic Canada before, you’re not alone. Indeed, many Canadians refer to Toronto as “east”&#8217; despite there being 1,900 miles between Drake and The Weeknd’s hometown and St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, the easternmost point of Canada and North America. The four provinces that make up Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) are easy to overlook for their remoteness. Known within Canada for its sleepy seaside towns, kitchen parties,<a href="https://www.anneofgreengables.com/"> trouble-making red-headed orphans</a> and lobster galore, Atlantic Canada has had a rough few decades.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the<a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/grandbanks.htm"> cod fishing industry</a> in the 1990s followed by the migration of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/irving-family-closing-idled-saint-john-shipyard-1.396417">shipbuilding</a> to Asia, Atlantic Canada defined itself as the have-not region of America’s rational northern neighbor. Despite booming from the war years onward due to its abundant natural resources, since the ’90s Atlantic Canada has watched its young people migrate west to the oil fields of Alberta for blue-collar work and to Toronto and Montreal for white-collar work.</p>
<p>Soon, the region’s hard-luck narrative stuck. Stephen Harper, the country’s prime minister from 2006 to 2015, famously quipped that the region suffered from “<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/harper-plans-to-battle-culture-of-defeatism-in-atlantic-canada-1.306785">a culture of defeatism</a>.” The narrative of the death of the coastal region became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Then, during the pandemic, the narrative drastically changed. In September 2020, Halifax-based fitness data management company<a href="https://www.kinduct.com/"> Kinduct</a> was<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200922005159/en/Kinduct-Acquired-by-mCube"> acquired by mCube</a>. In November 2020, Newfoundland-based<a href="https://verafin.com/"> Verafin</a> was<a href="https://betakit.com/nasdaq-acquires-st-johns-based-verafin-for-2-75-billion-usd/"> acquired by Nasdaq</a> for $2.75 billion in cash. In January 2021, Prince Edward Island-based<a href="https://www.screenscape.com/"> ScreenScape Networks was acquired by Spectrio</a> for an undisclosed fee, then Halifax-based storytelling platform<a href="https://huddle.today/wattpad-sold-in-600-million-deal-but-new-owners-will-keep-halifax-operations/"> Wattpad was acquired by Naver</a> in a deal worth $600 million. Atlantic Canada had four major tech acquisitions in a five-month period.</p>
<p>Outsiders were surprised by the sudden upsurge in exits, but momentum had been building for some time. Business writer Gordon Pitts pinpoints 2011 as the game-changing year for the Atlantic startup scene. In his book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Woods-Coast-Dreamers-Changing/dp/177310151X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pitts+unicorn&amp;qid=1612642820&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"> “Unicorn in the Woods: How East Coast Geeks and Dreamers are Changing the Game</a><em>,</em>” Pitts recounts how in March 2011<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/30/salesforce-buys-social-media-monitoring-company-radian6-for-326-million/"> Salesforce</a> purchased New Brunswick-based social media monitoring company<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/radian6"> Radian6</a> for approximately $300 million. Then, in November of the same year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/04/ibm-buys-network-security-intelligence-company-q1-labs/"> IBM purchased another New Brunswick-based startup</a>, cybersecurity company<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/q1-labs"> Q1 labs</a>, for a reported $600 million. If anyone considered the Radian6 acquisition a one-off chance event, the subsequent success of Q1 labs demonstrated there was a <em>there </em>there<em>. </em></p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, one might expect the founders of Radian6 and Q1 labs to disappear into the suburbs of Cambridge or Marin Country, but that never happened. Rather than uproot their newly acquired companies, both Salesforce and IBM opened engineering offices in Fredericton. Verafin would appear to be following suit:<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-acquire-verafin-creating-a-global-leader-in-the-fight-against-financial"> in the press release announcing the acquisition</a>, Nasdaq committed to keeping the company’s headquarters in Newfoundland, investing in the local university and contributing to the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once lone rangers, Q1 Labs and Radian6 are now surrounded by thriving copycats in a self-sustaining ecosystem. According to Peter Moreira, founder of<a href="http://entrevestor.com/"> Entrevestor,</a> a publication that has tracked the Atlantic Canadian startup scene since 2011, the ecosystem has attracted over a billion dollars in investment spread among 700 companies, creating more than 6,000 direct jobs. About 100 companies are created every year in fields as diverse as life sciences, cleantech and ocean tech.</p>
<p>VC firms have taken notice: notable investors in Atlantic Canadian startups include<a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/nova-scotias-carboncure-only-canadian-firm-to-land-investment-from-bill-gates-led-portfolio"> Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a>, a fund supported by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson. Indeed, what’s remarkable about the string of recent exits is their diversity across industries and their inside-baseball inclinations, spanning everything from fraudulent credit card transactions to fitness data and video technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-bird-835b5576/">Sandy Bird</a> is one of the protagonists of the Atlantic Canada tech-driven economic revival. Sandy co-founded Q1 Labs and then, after the acquisition, became the CTO of IBM’s security division. In 2017, Bird and the former CEO of Q1 Labs founded a new cybersecurity company, this one focused on public clouds, called<a href="https://sonraisecurity.com/"> Sonrai Security</a>, which has since raised<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/sonrai-security-nabs-20m-series-b/"> nearly $40 million in venture capital</a>. Bird takes great pride in having lived his entire life within a 30-minute radius and showing the world that his prior exit was not a one-off event.</p>
<p>According to Bird, IBM was happy to keep an engineering division in New Brunswick because the quality of the engineers is high and employee attrition, one of the obstacles for any fast-growing company operating in the competitive labor market of the San Francisco Bay Area, is low. Atlantic Canada is a place where the idea of the “company man/woman” is still alive and thriving.</p>
<p>Bird noted that “thanks to our high retention, we’re able to build a company culture that makes up for any of the disadvantages of a smaller labor market.” Bird also pointed out that the Atlantic time zones are ideal, enabling effective communications with Europe as well as the rest of North America.</p>
<p>Bird is also honest about the region’s shortcomings. For example, airline connections to Atlantic Canada can be tricky. Getting to places like Denver can take a day and multiple connections. Sonrai Security, for example, has its core engineering team in Fredericton while sales and marketing are in New York, with regional salespeople spread out around North America.</p>
<p>In terms of starting a company, the local ecosystem can provide those first checks to get a company up and running, but growth from Series B onward requires tapping into U.S. venture capital. Another challenge is hiring fast enough to meet the demands of a thriving tech company. Though companies like his can recruit recent graduates and exiled Atlantic Canadians eager to return, Bird mentioned that Q1 Labs opened a parallel engineering office in Belfast, Ireland, to scale-up hiring.</p>
<p>So what is the playbook for other rural regions hoping to copy the Atlantic Canada model of generating tech jobs? Speaking to insiders, all cite the low cost of living and high quality of life as enabling startups to both attract and retain talent. Second, a welcoming attitude toward immigration helps. Even prior to COVID-19, Canada cheekily took advantage of anxiety around U.S. immigration policies to launch a startup visa program to attract entrepreneurs and H1-B visa holders away from the United States, and many cite that program as acting as a strategic advantage for the coastal provinces.</p>
<p>Atlantic Canada’s recent success is owed in part to proactive government. After years of failed top-down economic development initiatives, both the provincial and the federal governments have found formulas to kickstart new companies through grants as well as repayable and non-repayable non-dilutive funding.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs cite<a href="https://boastcapital.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-irap-funding/"> IRAP</a>, the National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program, as key to obtaining funds that subsidize wages for staff and contractors. Another federal government agency, the<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/atlantic-canada-opportunities.html"> Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency</a> (ACOA), awards funding between CA$500,000 and CA$3 million (roughly $400,000 USD to $2.4 million USD) through its<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/atlantic-canada-opportunities/services/atlanticinnovationfund.html"> Atlantic Innovation Fund</a> (AIF). Each of the four provincial governments has its own incentive programs, which include grants and wage subsidies as well as incentives for private investors.</p>
<p>Despite these government programs, local entrepreneurs stress that the region’s modest success is primarily driven by the private sector. Each province tends to have a godfather/cheerleader who has championed local startups through investment, advice and connections. Notable also is the accessibility of the success stories of the region’s protagonists. In a place where ostentatious displays of wealth are avoided, successful founders are easy to get a hold of and happy to provide advice, contacts and in some cases capital. Also notable is the region’s mix of 16 public-private universities that produce graduates with varied skill sets across STEM and humanities programs.</p>
<p>Even with these advances, obstacles abound, and it remains to be seen whether politicians and policy-makers can match entrepreneurs with bold initiatives. While countries like Ireland and Estonia have rewritten their corporate tax codes to encourage tech companies to set up in their previously disadvantaged jurisdictions, Atlantic Canada<a href="http://www.taxpayer.com/media/AtlanticCanadaTaxDisadvantage.pdf"> continues to have tax rates</a> above neighboring provinces and U.S. states. Past innovation hubs have relied on physical proximity in order to build networks of human and social capital. Atlantic Canada as a region spans 500,000 square kilometers (193,256 square miles), much of which is hard to get to and poorly connected to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Having done the hard work of providing the region with a new narrative, and a newfound sense of self-belief, many entrepreneurs hope to finally transition away from a declining resource-based economic model. They want to create a world where ambitious Atlantic Canadians don’t need to choose between staying close to home and pursuing exciting careers.</p>
<p>There are reasons to be hopeful: With every exit, future entrepreneurs are provided the success stories that, like supernovas, explode and act as the base material for new ventures. With every VC investment, the region’s network of startups builds the social capital that can enable the next round of funding. With every innovation, the region’s breadth of knowledge deepens through newfound expertise.</p>
<p>And with Atlantic Canada’s traditional migratory patterns seeming to reverse themselves as workers return to seek a lower cost of living and higher quality of life in small towns with coastal views, the pool of talent has only increased.</p>
<p>In the post-COVID world, talent can go anywhere, proving that constant proximity is not a prerequisite to building high-performing companies. To replicate the Atlantic Canada model, however, rural areas will need to offer more than a lower cost of living, as<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-house-prices-crea-increase-1.5842311"> housing prices quickly catch up to demand</a>.</p>
<p>Atlantic Canada’s modest success can be summarized as the result of fomenting a highly collaborative ecosystem that includes companies, universities, investors and government to ensure that the human capital, social capital and financial capital are available to propel new companies forward. Only by building an ecosystem can we create economic models where instead of talent chasing opportunity, opportunity chases talent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re taking a look at some of the buzzier stories from the world of apps, including the latest around Parler&#8217;s attempted return to the App Store, a review of Walmart&#8217;s second livestream shopping event, and Instagram Lite&#8217;s global rollout. We also have new Clubhouse data on its total installs and its global footprint and info about Disney&#8217;s new service that could replace your MagicBand, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Parler tries and fails to re-enter App Store</h3>
<p>The right-wing social app was booted from the App Store, Google Play and Amazon AWS following the U.S. Capitol riot, for violations of community guidelines. Apple had specifically asked Parler to change its moderation policies, which had been fairly hands-off prior to its removal from the App Store. Though Apple has a number of rules about what apps can and cannot do, Parler&#8217;s own policies were guided by the First Amendment&#8217;s approach to free speech &#8212; basically, users could say almost anything without consequence.</p>
<p>According to documents <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store">obtained by Bloomberg</a>, Parler again tried to gain entry into the App Store after the original ban, and was again denied. Following the new review, Apple reportedly told Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer on Feb. 25, there was no place for &#8220;hateful, racist, discriminatory content&#8221; on the App Store. The review had also included several offensive images, including profile pictures with swastikas and other white nationalist imagery, as well as misogynistic, homophobic and racist usernames and posts.</p>
<p>Parler last month had said negotiations with Apple were underway, and it expected to get back in the App Store. But with this new rejection, Parler cut its three remaining iOS developers from its team, out of a total of seven who were let go, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>The controversy around Parler is reflective of a larger conversation underway in the U.S. over tech&#8217;s responsibility to moderate the content on its platforms, as users&#8217; posts and comments are increasingly leading to real-world violence. The U.S. government has not yet regulated these platforms, leaving decisions like this up to tech itself. Parler, in a statement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols">said it had added filters and human review</a> to address threats of violence, as well as optional tools that let users filter and block certain kinds of hate speech. But this didn&#8217;t go far enough to address Apple&#8217;s claims about hate symbols and offensive speech still present on the network.</p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p>Apple<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/apple-security-updates-iphone-ipad-mac-watch/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"> released important security patches</a> across all platforms. The patches fix a vulnerability — a memory corruption bug in WebKit, the engine that powers Apple’s Safari browser. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability via a malicious web page.</p>

The event, co-hosted by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gabbymorr?lang=en">Gabby Morrison</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nabela?">Nabela Noor</a>, focused on beauty products, offering demos and tutorials where viewers could buy the products through an integrated shopping cart. The content itself was engaging, feeling very much like the makeup tutorials and &#8220;get ready with me&#8221; vlogs users already watch across social media platforms. Gabby, who demoed all the products, was adept at balancing the more casual makeup try-on portions of the live event with the QVC-like call-to-action to actually buy the item being shown.</p>
<p>At times, there were as many as 8,000+ concurrent viewers participating in the live event, we noticed during our viewing. (We joined about 20 mins. after its start). During the event, we saw high engagement in the stream&#8217;s comments, including a number of positive comments &#8212; like jokes from users who lamented they were buying everything, shout-outs from those who just added an item to their cart, or compliments directed at the hosts. But there were also some trolling remarks that should have violated TikTok&#8217;s guidelines over cyberbullying, which were not moderated out &#8212; an issue TikTok will need to address as these events grow larger and more common.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124553" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124553" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2124553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-from-iOS-9.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of Walmart&#8217;s account on TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Walmart last year had run an apparel-focused live shopping holiday event &#8212; the first pilot of TikTok&#8217;s live shopping feature in the U.S. The retailer has not commented on sales from its first event, but says they hit Walmart&#8217;s projections. Walmart also said the event drove a 25% increase in TikTok follower growth, and 7x more views than anticipated.</p>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>Facebook is targeting emerging markets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/facebook-targets-emerging-markets-with-instagram-lite-a-new-android-app-that-takes-up-just-2mb-in-170-countries/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">with launch of Instagram Lite</a>,</strong> a lightweight Android version of the app that takes up just 2MB of space. The app was made available across 170 countries this week, offering the ability to view and share photos and videos, Stories, IGTV, discover content through Explore, and more. However, the app lacks the ability to film Reels &#8212; Instagram&#8217;s TikTok rival &#8212; users can only view them.</p>

<p>The app is not Facebook&#8217;s first attempt to develop a lightweight version of Instagram. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/">previously</a> released an Progressive Web App, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/">pulled</a> in 2020. A new app was then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-launches-new-instagram-lite-app-in-india-global-rollout-to-follow-later/">launched</a> in December in India in a limited test, ahead of this broader release.</p>

The largest market for the app is still the U.S. which accounts for 3.1 million downloads. But the app has a strong global footprint, with 1.8m downloads in Japan, 710K in Germany, 600K in Brazil, 505K in Russia, 420K in Italy, 375K in the U.K., 370K in South Korea, 350K in Turkey, and 107K in France, the firm said. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">Clubhouse was said to have 8 million global downloads</a> just in February, so this is notable growth.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/facebook-is-bringing-ads-to-shorter-videos-and-stories">expands creator monetization options</a> with the addition of ads for short-form video content</strong> &#8212; including videos as short as 1 minute, instead of previous minimum of 3 minutes. Those ads will now play 30 seconds after the start of a shorter video. It also opened its in-stream ads program for Live videos out of invite-only mode. The move could encourage creators to make content for Facebook instead of rival platforms like TikTok, by wooing them with more money-making opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>A new app called Limit App is offering an Instagram-like service but only for those ages 18 to 25</strong>. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/new-limit-app-targets-social-media-users-18-25-kicks-off-turn-26/">Reviewed by Geekwire</a>, the app&#8217;s creator said it&#8217;s not about ageism, but rather about giving young people a place to be themselves. The app uses a secure ID and age verification process to onboard users and, when they turn 26, they&#8217;re giving 30 days to download their content before being booted out. Begone, boomers.</p>

<h3>Photos</h3>

<p><strong>Twitter began a test to make photos look better on its platform.</strong> The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">is trying out a new way to display images</a> which offer sa more accurate preview of what the photo looks like, instead of automatically cropping the image as before. The change, in part, is also meant to address issues around the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/">baked-in racial bias in Twitter&#8217;s algorithm</a> that decided which part of the image to focus on when cropping.</p>
<h3>Messaging and Communications</h3>
<p><strong>Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321624/google-chrome-os-new-features-phone-hub-nearby-share-chromebooks">will link Android phones with Chromebooks</a> through a new Phone Hub feature</strong>, allowing Chrome OS users to respond to texts, check their battery life, enable a Wi-Fi hotspot and locate a misplaced device, among other things.</p>
<h3>Dating Apps</h3>

At launch, users can play trivia games but the company says it plans more virtual experiences in the future. The timing of the launch is interesting &#8212; it comes a year into the pandemic which has forced people to stay home and social distance. But as &#8220;Night In&#8221; arrives, vaccinations are ramping up and, likely, so will real-world, in-person dating. That Bumble still invested in virtual dating experiences indicates the company sees the feature as something with longer-term potential, rather than a temporary stand-in for that first drink or coffee date.</p>

<p><strong>Bumble also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/bumble-bmbl-earnings-q4-2020.html">filed its first quarterly report</a> since its Feb. 2021 IPO</strong>, topping Wall St. estimates with $165.6 million in revenue and 2.7 million paid users (up 32.5% YoY) in the fourth quarter.</p>
<h3>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon adds a merch store to its streaming music app.</strong> The company&#8217;s Amazon Music app is <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/amazon-music-is-also-a-merch-store-now-as-streamer-integrates-in-app-product-sales-from-billie-eilish-selena-gomez-and-other-artists/">now offering in-app product sales</a> from Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez, and other artists via a Merchbar integration. (Just wait until it actually remembers it has a whole retail website it could connect.)</p>
<p><strong>YES Network <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/yes-network-launches-new-app-to-stream-live-games-with-tv-everywhere">debuts an app</a> that will live stream New York Yankees, Brooklyn Nets</strong>, NYFC, and New York Liberty games via a TV Everywhere integration. This is the first live streaming app from the network. Sure, we need another one.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Podcasts is replacing the &#8220;subscribe&#8221; button with a &#8220;follow&#8221; button</strong> for keeping up with favorite podcasts. The change, first reported by <a href="https://podnews.net/update/follow-not-subscribe">Podnews</a>, came about because people increasingly think of subscribe as referring to a paid option. I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t get that idea from&#8230;THE APP STORE.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify this week updated its app <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-11/spotify-is-rolling-out-36-new-languages-on-mobile/">with support for 36 new languages</a></strong>, as promised during last month&#8217;s &#8220;Stream On&#8221; event, including: Afrikaans, Amharic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Bulgarian, Simplified Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Estonian, Filipino, Gujarati, Hindi, Icelandic, Kannada, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Persian, Portuguese for Portugal, Eastern Punjabi, Western Punjabi, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Zulu. <strong>The app is now available in 62 languages in total, and is expanding to over 80 global markets.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New streaming service Paramount+ saw its app downloaded 277K+ times in the first 5 days,</strong> <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/paramount-downloaded-277k-times-in-first-five-days-new-cbs-app-ranks-higher">reports Apptopia</a>. The app launched similarly to how HBO Max did &#8212; it took an existing app and transitioned it to a new one. In its case, the CBS All Access app transitioned to Paramount+. This impacts the number of early downloads, as many users are just upgraded. Thanks to a pre-launch sale, the app also saw $86.7K in IAP revenue on March 2, the highest single-day revenue to date.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the end for MagicBands, though. The bands still make sense for kids without devices or for anyone who doesn&#8217;t want to worry about pulling out their phone for every ride (or who doesn&#8217;t own an Apple Watch). Plus, some Disney fans like collecting MagicBands in new styles. Disney said it will soon release a new set with favorite characters.</p>

Meitu chairman Cai Wensheng has been bullish on cryptocurrency and believes in diversifying beyond holding just cash.</p>
<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/apple-loses-push-to-move-consumer-privacy-suit-into-arbitration">must face a consumer lawsuit</a> over FaceTime and iMessage privacy in court, not through private arbitration</strong>. The case, Ohanian v Apple Inc. focuses on an iOS bug coupled with T-Mobile&#8217;s approach to recycling phone numbers that gave third-parties access to users&#8217; communications, despite Apple&#8217;s marketing of iMessage and FaceTime as secure features.</p>
<p><strong>Apple is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/french-startup-lobby-targets-apple-with-privacy-hypocrisy-complaint/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">now facing a privacy complaint</a> in Europe</strong> from startup lobby group, France Digitale. The complaint focuses on the IDFA changes, which will required third-party apps to have to ask to track users, while Apple&#8217;s own apps are able to track user activity and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/09/french-antitrust-complaint-alleges-apple-allows-itself-to-run-personalized-ads-on-ios-without-getting-user-consent/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29">run personalized ads by default</a> without a similar opt-in pop-up, giving it an unfair advantage.</p>

<h3>Wombo</h3>
<p>Last week, &#8220;deep nostalgia&#8221; was going viral as people animated their long-lost relatives or even closer family members using apps like MyHeritage or TokkingHeads. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/wombo-ai-lets-users-make-silly-deepfake-videos-of-their-friends-or-celebrities-singing-songs/articleshow/81457212.cms">But this week, everyone&#8217;s trying out Wombo</a> &#8212; an AI-powered deepfake app that can animate any face to lip sync to songs like &#8220;Thriller&#8221; or &#8220;I Will Survive,&#8221;  as well as many meme songs, like &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221; or &#8220;Numa Numa.&#8221; The results are&#8230;<em>ugh</em>, <em>cringe</em>. But the attention sent a surge of downloads to the app, moving it up to (as of the time of writing) No. 30 Overall on the App Store. Since its Feb. 2020 launch, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/12/wombo-ai-app-kim-jong-un-sing-i-will-survive-deepfakes">the app has been downloaded 2M+ times</a> across iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SolarWinds is back in hot water after a shareholder lawsuit accused the company of poor security practices, which they say allowed hackers to break into at least nine U.S. government agencies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">hundreds of companies</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit said SolarWinds used an easily guessable password &#8220;solarwinds123&#8221; on an update server, which was subsequently breached by hackers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">&#8220;likely Russian in origin.&#8221;</a> SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna, speaking at a congressional hearing in March, blamed the weak password on an intern.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Experts are still trying to understand just how the hackers broke into SolarWinds servers. But the weak password does reveal wider issues about the company&#8217;s security practices — including how the easily guessable password was allowed to be set to begin with.</p>
<p>Even if the intern is held culpable, SolarWinds still faces what&#8217;s known as vicarious liability — and that can lead to hefty penalties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While London, Paris, Berlin and Stockholm feature regularly in tech coverage, the rest of Europe has been busy.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic may be better known for beer, hockey and the sights of Prague, but its entrepreneurial community is as ambitious as any. Pipedrive is an EU-based CRM company with offices in eight countries, but it has a Czech co-founder in VP of Product Martin Henk, one of several founders to emerge from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Then there was Integromat, which did not raise any external capital but sold for around 2.5 billion crowns ($114 million), making its seven Czech founders into multimillionaires. Prague&#8217;s Memsource is valued at approximately 1.3 billion crowns or $59 million. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To unpack this rare gem of Europe’s startup scene, we spoke to eight area investors.</p>
<p>Among the trends they identified are startups in B2B, business automation processes, e-commerce, AI, SaaS and COVID-19-related solutions, as well as &#8220;smart&#8221; everything: factories, cities, offices, etc. Other themes included cybersecurity, AR/VR, remote work, and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Saturated areas included cryptocurrency, blockchain, fintech and martech. The people we spoke to said they see travel, dating apps and other businesses traditionally based on physical interaction as weaker segments. Still, new opportunities are popping up in remote work, psychedelics and wellness.</p>

<p>Respondents said they invest around 50% inside Czechia and 50% across Central and Eastern Europe, while some are more focused across CEE generally, with some percentage of the fund supporting startups that have scaled to the U.S.</p>
<p>Most said their investments hadn&#8217;t been significantly impacted by COVID-19, but future uncertainly is a concern. The advice is to “be frugal to accommodate to the new situation and roll on.”</p>
<p>As far as green shoots, COVID-19 has “played a role of an accelerator for innovation in many business areas and even e-government and other rigid/conservative industries,” said one. D2C startups have benefitted and “Zoom selling&#8221; now seems “totally plausible.”</p>

<h2>Ondrej Bartos, founding partner, Credo Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Automation, AI, enabling remote, authentication.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
TypingDNA.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Outstanding founders tackling big opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
VR/AR has been an area with lots of investment, therefore very competitive. AI is overhyped but most AI are actually not that intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Less. We focus on Central Europe as a region (if that would count as local, then more than 50%).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Central Europe is well positioned in automation, security, developer tools and analytics. I&#8217;m most excited about UiPath, Productboard, Pricefx, TypingDNA, Spaceflow, Around (in our portfolio). Best CE founders are in my view Daniel Dines, Hubert Palan, Marcin Cichon plus Oliver Dlouhý (Kiwi.com).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
There are a lot of great developers in Prague, good energy and enough success stories and role models to follow. There is a lot of investment capital there (just as everywhere else I guess), not too much smart money yet, so definitely opportunity for good VCs to take a look (and they are looking).</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I have no doubts that the pandemic has been accelerating remote work, which ultimately should lead to more remote-first startups which might benefit new geos.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel and hospitality seem most fragile and unpredictable due to COVID-19. Remote and enabling remote seem like the biggest opportunity; automation and enabling digital transformation are attractive as well.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy is unchanged; actually we&#8217;ll double down on it. There is a lot of opportunity for good tech startups, technology is what&#8217;s helping people and countries to get out of crises faster with less damage. Our advice to startups is still the same: Focus on your cause and try to solve problems in your space better than anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
We definitely see green shoots in some of the enterprise software companies. &#8220;Zoom selling&#8221; now seems totally plausible, sales cycles shortened in some verticals as companies need to digitize and enable remote work.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve always had hope. Yes, there have been low moments especially when quarantined, but overall I haven&#8217;t lost hope for people to cope with this unprecedented situation, and for technology to play a significant role in the recovery. I still have this hope :)</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
I feel like I had been traveling too much, two- or three-day transatlantic trips make little sense and I think I won&#8217;t go back there. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go back to 5+ days in the office every week, home office works fine with me and it will stay with me and the company in some capacity. That being said, it is what I feel now. I may be wrong and things may go back to &#8220;old normal&#8221; — which I would consider a big mistake and lost opportunity.</p>

IP Fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We would like to see more insurtech startups in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are looking for synergies with our partner companies rather looking into a specific branch.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Fintech is oversaturated with very low margins.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We mostly invest locally, but our most successful investment was in Taxify (now Bolt).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Definitely security domain is best positioned. We are excited about IP Fabric (founder is ex-Cisco CEO Pavel Bykov), Whalebone (R. Malovič), Wultra (P. Dvořák).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The interest is bigger, a lot of successful startups raise demand for opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We don&#8217;t think so, local network is important. Remote work is not for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
There will be shifts in retail. This is an opportunity for startups like Pygmalios, which provide analytics for retail.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Luckily the impact is not big. Biggest worries are about difficulties with travel abroad for business meetings. Our advice is hold the runway longer :-)</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, demand for call center tools like omnichannel solution mluvii.com, which works at the home office move up significantly.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
At spring our country was &#8220;best in COVID&#8221; and now it is &#8220;worst in COVID.&#8221; Last spring thousands of people from the startup community helped and came up with brilliant ideas, apps and solutions but at the end most outcomes (like <a href="https://erouska.cz/en">eRouška</a> and <a href="https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/">https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/</a>) were screwed by slow or faulty decisions of government. Instead of hope I&#8217;m disappointed, but I believe that vaccination will help us to get life back on the track.</p>

<h2>Lukáš Konečný, principal, Y Soft Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Anything that helps businesses run smarter is something we would like to take a look at. More specifically we are interested in areas such as Internet of Things, smart factories, smart cities, smart office, cybersecurity, big data and AR/VR. And especially when there is some kind of hardware involved — that something we really love.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="https://vrgineers.com">VRgineers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
It would be great to see more startups focusing on hardware. Admittedly, creating hardware and scaling-up a hardware-focused business is always a bigger challenge, but the opportunities are so vast and many are yet untapped.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Apart from the &#8220;obvious&#8221; aspects such as innovativeness, global potential, scalability, strong team and fit with our investment thesis, we look for founders who show great strategic thinking and execution skills, who really understand the market and their customers&#8217; needs and listen to feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Considering our focus on B2B, we have better overview of this part of the economy. Lately, we have seen a huge number of startups using AI/ML for computer vision or natural language processing use cases creating very similar products, meaning it will be rather difficult for them to differentiate and outperform the rest of the competition. But that does not mean that a new revolutionary idea cannot appear.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our focus is on the Central European region — so far we have invested in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but we are open to founders from other neighboring countries as well. The majority of our portfolio is located in the Brno/South Moravia region, where Y Soft is based. It is not an outcome of an intentional strategy, but just the reality of which startups interested us the most.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Generally, the Czech startup ecosystem is getting more mature, especially thanks to serial entrepreneurs as well as more experienced first-time founders, and the developing business angel/VC ecosystem. It is hard to pick just one industry, as the spectrum of companies is very vast.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
From the investors&#8217; point of view, the Czech startup ecosystem can provide a lot of interesting opportunities, and especially for foreign investors the investments can be a &#8220;good value for money,&#8221; even though the VC ecosystem has become more competitive in the last years due to influx of new money. The seed and partly Series A segment can be seen as rather saturated, but there is a significant potential in the larger Series A or later-stage investments.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The main Czech hubs, Prague and Brno, are probably not going to see their status weakened, as they are not only business centers, but also have the main universities where the talented people are and are hearts of the cultural life that is attractive to many. But we will see a shift toward remote woking, allowing founders to tap a wider talent pool.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We believe that after the shock caused by COVID-19 fades away, there will be more opportunities for the companies in segments we invest in, as the induced trends are only forcing businesses to run smarter. The trends most relevant to us will be those associated with accelerated digital transformation, changes in supply chains and evolution of workspaces.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our strategy. The only changes were on the tactical level, as for a certain period of time we shifted more capacities to portfolio support. Most of our founders had to deal with a negative impact on their sales funnel, as some customers postponed or cancelled the planned deals. Some of the founders had to deal with disruptions in the distribution channels, as some of their partners&#8217; businesses were hit rather hard, and a small number of companies had to resolve issues with their supply chain. These challenges are still, to an extent, worries to our portfolio companies, as the economic development is still uncertain. To deal with the situation, cash flow became the main focus, together with more active communication with key business partners throughout the value chains.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
We have seen a lot of positive signals in retention and some green shoots regarding revenue, but the situation is still too fragile.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
It is hard to find glimmers of hope lately, as the situation in the Czech Republic is really not developing well. However, I was recently able to participate in several online events that young entrepreneurs, in some cases even high school or university students, attended to present their projects or to improve their business skills. And it was great to see people who are still deeply interested in — and invested in — the entrepreneurial path, regardless of the current situation.</p>

<h2>Vaclav Pavlecka, managing partner, Air Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are sector agnostic, so it&#8217;s not so much about &#8220;trends,&#8221; rather than other aspects of startups in our pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Cross Network Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Many sectors are &#8220;to-be-disrupted yet&#8221; but for example I believe that the predictive medicine (that helps you avoid the problem instead the one that is helping to solve the problem that is already there) will be one of the major trends for the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Distinctive unique selling proposition, market-oriented and sales-hungry team, disruptive potential, upmarket potential.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Social networks in general are the type of services I am concerned about due to a long-term impact on one&#8217;s mental health and due to social confirmation bias and decreasing ability for a healthy unheated critical discussion in society. As for oversaturation, it is hard to generalize, since every industry still has its niches. But a top of my mind idea for an oversaturated market is the marketing technologies sector (as well as many other software products). Solutions are easily replicable (think chatbots) and successful only at the limited market.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We tend to focus on companies with the local strings (with exceptions made — e.g., Californian clothing startup Nahmias).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We see a huge potential of local talents in cybersecurity, industry automation (due to the fact that Czechia has one of the densest &#8220;per capita&#8221; car production in the world), gaming industry (including esports), crypto and health. As for companies I think Apiary, Beat Games, Warhorse gaming studio, Mews.com, Kiwi.com, Snuggs, Prusa Research, Productboard, Rossum, Integromat and Alheon.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
&#8220;Local&#8221; VCs and investors are definitely willing to make meaningful connections and co-invest. The ecosystem is more mature every year and grows stronger. Prague and the surrounding region also has its charm that attracts many talents as the city has an ideal balance between the life quality and costs in comparison to other metropolitan areas.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I believe that we will see a big &#8220;return to the good part of the old system&#8221; in the end of this year/early 2022, so I won&#8217;t expect the big shift in the sense of geographic &#8220;founder density&#8221; outside of the major cities. If, however, the COVID-19 restrictions should last more years, then many social changes can be sparked, including geographic mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
No surprise there — the whole travel industry, gastronomical industry and culture tech are in the deepest crisis in decades. Many other industries are under big pressure to increase the speed of change, e.g., the education industry, the entertainment industry. Also in general small to medium businesses are having tough times locally, since the government restrictions are not being implemented efficiently and their communication isn&#8217;t built around a sound strategy.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy is built around long-lasting principles and therefore we didn&#8217;t have to change it completely. Of course the investment appetite in sectors hit by crisis decreased significantly but other opportunities emerged. As for portfolio impact, proptech vertical was hit heavily and some of our companies had to reiterate their product offering. Our general advice to any startup in our portfolio is to boost the dialogue with their customers, learn how their needs are shifting (if so) and try to steer the wheel in the right time. If needed, we are ready to support our founders financially and also teamwise, since we are hands-on investors.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
D2C startups with a sound unit economy and their own strong distribution channels are thriving (not only locally). This includes our portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Not losing hope really. I think people were in much deeper crises and that we refer to the current situation as we do only due to lack of historical comparability. We are still living in times of prosperity and the pandemic will eventually go away thanks to the scientific progress people have achieved. So I think the beacon of positive change are all the RNA vaccines out there. I am thrilled by the restless work of scientists involved in their development and I believe they should receive much greater social credit than they do nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Great technical talent with superb ideas falling behind with go-to-market and sales skills.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think so, I believe the talent will still be attracted by existing major hubs. Smaller the team, more interaction is needed. Despite all the innovations in remote work one-to-one interactions and social time cannot be fully replaced (yet).</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Exposed — travel, dating apps … all businesses traditionally based on physical interaction. Not a surprise I guess :) Opportunities — remote work applications, psychedelic applications, well-being startups, life science solutions, logistics and related industries, e-commerce for SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>Has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really. Our No. 1 investment criteria is strong founders. Most of them were able to adjust their business models to the new market conditions. Spring 2020 advice was cash is king, stay frugal and adjust your business to the new market conditions ASAP or others will.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes. I believe COVID-19 played a role of an accelerator for innovations in many business areas and even e-government and other rigid/conservative industries.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Given all the events of 2020 we had a solid year as a fund. What was inspiring — seeing founders coming across whatever obstacles thrown under their legs … overcoming them with new ideas/inventions and unbreakable entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Hard to name one or a few … every single player plays a different role and one individual is unimportant without others. Same as in nature, even the strongest/biggest predators cannot thrive without a thriving ecosystem as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says there is no room for a new social network?</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a round of $15 million to $20 million in seven-month-old Kutumb that values the Indian startup at about $170 million, four people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The American investment firm has offered a termsheet to the Indian startup but the deal &#8212; a Series A &#8212; has not closed yet, some of the people said on the condition of anonymity as the talks are private. Usual caveat: Terms may change, or the deal may not materialize.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://kutumbapp.com/">Kutumb</a>, which means family in Hindi, has built a “private social network like Reddit” that connects communities based on “culture, creed, beliefs, interests, [and] professions.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s eponymous six-month-old app has amassed over 11 million monthly active users, up from about 550,000 in December last year, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>Kutumb was valued at about $15 million late last year when it raised funds from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge accelerator. It raised about $2.5 million in its seed financing round, according to insight firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>Tiger Global declined to comment. One of the co-founders of Kutumb didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year. The larger HomePod offered a beefier sound space but the mini has been very well received and clearly accomplishes many of the duties that the larger version was tasked with. The sound is super solid (especially for the size) and it offers access to Siri, Apple&#8217;s assistant feature.</p>
<p>The original HomePod was a feat of audio engineering that Apple spent over five years developing. In order to accomplish its development, the team at Apple built out a full development center near its headquarters in Cupertino, with a world-class development environment with a dozen anechoic chambers, including one of the bigger anechoic chambers outside of academic use in the US. I visited the center before its release, noting that Apple took it the extra mile to get the incredibly complex series of tweeters and woofer that built its soundspace:</p>
<blockquote><p>But slathered on top of that is a bunch of typically Apple extra-mile jelly. Apple says that its largest test chamber is one of the biggest in the US, on a pad, suspended from the outside world with nothing to pollute its tests of audio purity. Beyond testing for the acoustic qualities of the speaker, these chambers allowed Apple to burrow down to account for and mitigate the issues that typically arise from having a high excursion subwoofer in such a small cabinet. Going even further, there are smaller chambers that allow them to isolate the hum from electronic components (there is a computer on board after all) and make attempts to insulate and control that noise so it doesn’t show up in the final output.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I found it to be one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/a-four-sentence-homepod-review-with-appendices/">best speakers ever made</a> for the home when I reviewed it in 2018. From the booming base and well-shaped nature of the tweeter assembly inside; the cloth cover that was specially shaped to avoid interfering with sound quality in any way; the way that it sensed the way that audio was being shaped by walls and other obstructions and adjusted its output to compensate. It was the definition of &#8216;no effort spared&#8217; in the speaker department.</p>
<p>The major gripe for the speaker at the time was the $349 price, which was at the top end of the home speaker market, especially those with embedded home assistants. A price drop to $299 mitigated that somewhat, but still put it at the top of the pricing umbrella for the class. Apple&#8217;s HomePod mini, launched last year, has been well received. Our Brian Heater said that it had &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">remarkably big sound&#8217; for the $99 price.</a></p>
<p>Apple gave TechCrunch a statement about the discontinuation:</p>
<blockquote><p>HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Existing HomePods will continue to be sold but Apple&#8217;s website is already out of Space Gray. It will continue to provide support for existing HomePods. Apple seems to be betting on the mini going forward, which could point to their desire to fill every room with &#8216;good enough&#8217; sound rather than to focus on the living room with &#8216;truly unbelievable&#8217; sound. The HomePod itself never quite got to the level where it could act as a full home theater replacement, though paired in their multi-speaker configurations.</p>
<p>The HomePod research and production efforts will live on in some ways through Apple&#8217;s advanced audio rendering systems that led to things like Spatial Audio in AirPods. I quite enjoy the ones in my home and have yet to add any minis to the mix. Maybe a last minute hunt is in order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.passioncapital.com/">Passion Capital</a>, the early-stage venture firm in London, told TechCrunch earlier this week that &#8212; in an apparent first for a European fund &#8212;  it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/in-a-first-for-europe-passion-capital-will-crowd-fund-part-of-its-new-62m-fund-from-retail-investors/">plans to crowdfund</a> the final stage of its third and latest vehicle. Specifically, it’s carving out around half a million dollars for anyone who wants to invest in the vehicle, as long as they are a high net worth individual.</p>
<p>Firm founder Eileen Burbidge says the outfit was inspired by developments it has seen here in the U.S., from AngelList&#8217;s <a href="https://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">rolling fund</a> program, to an imminent change in a crowdfunding regulation, Reg CF, that <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/01/171249-after-long-wait-updates-to-crowdfunding-exemptions-publish-in-federal-register-with-new-rules-effective-in-march/">on Monday</a> is set to bump up the maximum amount that can be raised through a crowdfunding campaign from $1.07 million in any twelve-month period to $5 million &#8212; a nearly five-fold increase.</p>
<p>The move is interesting, especially coming on the heels of some other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/two-new-efforts-push-to-transform-more-people-into-limited-partners-of-vc-funds/">recent initiatives</a> to democratize venture capital. But if crowdfunding a piece of traditional venture funds does become a bigger trend, it’s not going to happen overnight. We talked with fund formation attorneys and administrators this week, and they’d barely registered that the crowdfunding limit is about to quintuple because they aren&#8217;t being asked about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why not? One fund formation attorney said he doesn’t think it will become a viable fundraising path &#8212; unless other paths aren’t available &#8212; because of the benefits of having investors who can provide contacts and expertise to portfolio companies. Think of the many funds that count CTOs as limited partners, for example; VCs can learn a lot about the kinds of technology they&#8217;re looking to implement by bringing them into the fold.</p>
<p>There are other pragmatic concerns, too. VCs like to personally know their limited partners because they call down capital on a deal-by-deal basis and want to be sure their investors will come through with the money.</p>
<p>A crowdfunded component could also be a &#8220;big  and permanent administrative burden,&#8221; given that it could involve &#8220;potentially hundreds of equity owners for a relatively small amount of money.&#8221; So notes attorney Mike Sullivan of the global law firm Orrick.</p>
<p>A less obvious reason VCs might not be thinking much about crowdfunding ties to complications when it comes to a firm’s internal rate of return. VCs don’t like to have money sitting around on their balance sheet; they like to call down the capital as they need it, because the clock doesn’t start ticking on an investment until they do this. (That gives them more time to hopefully shepherd an investment into an eventual success story that they can later tweet about.)</p>
<p>Asked about why the new crowdfunding cap isn&#8217;t on his colleagues&#8217; radar yet, one fund administrator tells us it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re all too busy dealing with with SPACs, those special purpose acquisition companies that are springing up like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-boom-visualized-in-one-chart-11612962000">mushrooms</a>.</p>
<p>That many of these blank-check outfits are taking public fairly nascent tech companies &#8212; giving retail investors access to the kinds of high-risk, high-reward startups that be otherwise out of reach &#8212;  could also slow the extent to which VCs begin incorporating more &#8220;ordinary&#8221; investors into the asset class.</p>
<p>Still, absent a last-minute change by the Biden administration &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t that appear one is coming (at least, Gary Gensler&#8217;s nomination to serve as SEC chairman still requires full Senate confirmation) &#8212; Reg CF is on the cusp of changing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth paying closer attention to what ripple effects &#8212; and opportunities &#8212; might result.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Extra Crunch publishes a variety of article types, but how-tos are my favorite category.</p>
<p>For many entrepreneurs, the startup they are trying to get off the ground might be only the second entry on their resume. As a result, they don&#8217;t have much experience to draw from when it comes to basics like hiring, fundraising and growth marketing.</p>
<p>Last week, Natasha Mascarenhas interviewed experts who had some strategic advice for finding the right time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/">to bring a product manager on board</a>. This afternoon, we published a guest post by growth marketer Jessica Li with tips for &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/how-nontechnical-talent-can-break-into-deep-tech/">how nontechnical talent can build relationships with deep tech companies</a>.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve also received great feedback on a recent guest post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/six-tips-for-saas-founders-who-dont-want-vc-money/">bootstrapping options for SaaS founders</a> written by a founder who&#8217;s actually done it.</p>

<p>As Roblox began to trade Wednesday, the company’s shares shot above its reference price of $45 per share. Roblox, a gaming company aimed at children, has had a tumultuous if exciting path to the public markets.</p>
<p>Seeing Roblox trade so very far above its direct listing reference price and final private valuation appears to undercut the argument that this sort of debut can sort out pricing issues inherent in more traditional IPOs.</p>

<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI.</p>
<p>GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses, able to return coherent and topical emails, tweets, trivia and much more. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications.</p>

<p>One of the first recurring features Alex Wilhelm established at Extra Crunch was the &#8220;$100M ARR Club,&#8221; ongoing coverage of startups that have reached scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget a $1 billion valuation — $100 million in annual recurring revenue is the cool kids&#8217; club,&#8221; he wrote in December 2019. Since then, he expanded it to cover companies that attained $50M ARR.</p>
<p>The concept is a useful lens for studying the market. I can say this with confidence because it&#8217;s been widely copied by other tech news outlets. But this morning, Alex surprised me — he&#8217;s shelving the ARR Club, at least for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end it became a pre-IPO list that was fun but not entirely educational, by my reckoning,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;The $50M ARR club evolution was supposed to help shake loose more interesting operational details, but just didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before putting the format on hiatus, Alex&#8217;s last ARR Club roundup looks at in-office display and kiosk startup AppSpace, data backup unicorn Druva, and Synack, which makes security software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A prominent Republican senator weighs in on Amazon&#8217;s labor disputes, Microsoft reports a security vulnerability in Exchange and we examine ByteDance&#8217;s gaming strategy. This is your Daily Crunch for March 12, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Marco Rubio sides with Amazon workers</strong></p>
<p>Senator Marco Rubio published <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/12/amazon-union-not-helping-working-class-economy-column/6947823002/">an op-ed</a> in USA Today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/">declaring his support for workers in Amazon&#8217;s warehouse</a> in Bessemer, Alabama, as they seek to unionize.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising for a Republican senator to throw his weight behind a nascent labor union, but it seems that Rubio&#8217;s position has as much to do with his feelings about Amazon as his labor politics. In fact, his op-ed warned of the &#8220;dangers posed by the unchecked influence of labor unions,&#8221; while also arguing that Amazon is guilty of &#8220;uniquely malicious corporate behavior.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Immune intelligence startup Serimmune hopes to better understand the relationship between antibody epitopes (the parts of antigen molecules that bind to antibodies) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>The company’s proprietary technology, originally developed at UC Santa Barbara, provides a new and specific way of mapping the entire array of an individual’s antibodies through a small blood sample. They do this through the use of a bacterial peptide display — a sort of screening mechanism that can isolate plasmid DNA from antibody-bound bacteria in the sample. This DNA can then be sequenced to identify epitopes, which provide information about which antigens someone may have been exposed to, as well as how their immune system responded to them.</p>
<p>“It’s a very highly multiplexed and exquisitely specific way of looking at the epitopes found by antibodies in a specimen,” said Serimmune CEO Noah Nasser, who has a degree in molecular biology from UC San Diego and has previously worked for several diagnostics companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Serimmune <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serimmune-launches-covid-antibody-epitope-mapping-service-301245377.html?tc=eml_cleartime">announced the launch of a new application of their core technology</a> to help understand the disease states of and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>“So what we do is we take these antibody profiles we build, and we’re able to then map those back with about a 12 amino acid specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,” said Nasser. “And what we find is that antibody expression is highly correlated to disease state, so we can distinguish mild, moderate, severe and asymptomatic disease on the basis of antibodies that are present in the specimen.”</p>
<p>The more patient data Serimmune can collect, the better its core technology becomes at finding patterns across different antigen exposure and disease severity. Noticing those patterns sooner won’t only help physicians and researchers to better understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus operates, but can also inform new approaches to diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for any antigen.</p>

<p>Serimmune’s launch of its new COVID antibody epitope mapping service is a way of making this data more accessible to customers like vaccine companies, government agencies and academic labs that have shown interest in better understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>“The key was to zero in on the information that researchers wanted to know and standardize that,” said Nasser. “We can actually now provide these results back in as few as two days from sample receipt.”</p>
<p>Beyond this new service, Serimmune also has plans to launch a <a href="https://serimmune.com/covid19study/">longitudinal clinical study on immunity to SARS-CoV-2</a>. Using a painless at-home collection kit, study participants send in small blood samples to Serimmune, which then uses its core technology to outline an individual immunity map.</p>
<p>“We provide their results back to them in the form of a personal immune landscape to COVID,” said Nasser. “And what we’re trying to do is to understand over time how that immune response changes, and what happens to that immune response on repeated exposure to COVID.”</p>
<p>The mapping technology is now so specific that it can tell whether a patient has antibodies from natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or from a vaccine, he added.</p>
<p>While the primary focus for Serimmune remains these applications to the COVID-19 pandemic for now, Nasser also mentioned that the company has plans to move into personalized medicine, potentially offering their mapping service directly to interested patients.</p>
<p>“We believe that this has value to individual patients in understanding their immune status and what antigens they’ve been exposed to,” he said. Until then, Serimmune plans to continue growing its database with more patient samples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets are the subject of another lawsuit.</p>
<p>A Tesla investor is suing the company board and Musk for continuing to send &#8220;erratic tweets&#8221; that violate a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires oversight of his social media activities. The lawsuit, which was <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/musk-tesla-board-sued-over-tweeting-in-violation-of-sec-deal">first reported by Bloomberg</a>, claims Musk is exposing the company to potential fines and penalties from regulators and could drive down its share price. The lawsuit names the board for failing to control Musk&#8217;s behavior, which puts the company at risk.</p>
<p>The lawsuit by investor Chase Gharrity, which was <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/public/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=2019-0217&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=">filed in Delaware Chancery Court</a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">was unsealed Friday. It was originally filed March 8. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla, Musk and the SEC reached an agreement in April 2019 that gave the CEO freedom to use Twitter &#8212; within certain limitations &#8212; without fear of being held in contempt for violating an earlier court order. The agreement allows Musk to tweet as he wishes except when it&#8217;s about certain events or financial milestones. In those cases, Musk must seek pre-approval from a securities lawyer, according to the agreement filed with Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>The April 2019 agreement was the product of a years-long fight between Musk and the SEC that began after his infamous August 7, 2018 tweet in which he stated the company had “funding secured” for a private takeover at $420 per share. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/here-is-the-sec-complaint-against-elon-musk-and-tesla/">SEC filed a complaint</a> alleging that Musk had committed securities fraud.</p>
<p>Musk and Tesla settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing. Tesla agreed to pay a $20 million fine; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/elon-musk-agrees-to-resign-as-tesla-chairman-in-settlement-with-sec/">Musk had to agree to step down</a> as Tesla chairman for a period of at least three years; the company had to appoint two independent directors to the board; and Tesla was also told to put in place a way to monitor Musk’s statements to the public about the company, including via Twitter.</p>
<p>The fight was reignited after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/sec-pushes-court-to-hold-elon-musk-in-contempt-over-tesla-tweets/">Musk sent a tweet</a> on February 19, 2019 that Tesla would produce “around” 500,000 cars that year, correcting himself hours later to clarify that he meant the company would be producing at an annualized rate of 500,000 vehicles by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest lawsuit alleges that Musk’s tweeting violates the April 2019 judgment and betrays his, and the board’s, fiduciary duty.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 105-page suit cites several tweets sent from Musk’s account, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tweet on May 1, 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — over a year after the SEC judgment — which stated: “Tesla stock is too high IMO.” </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla stock price is too high imo</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tweet </span>sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/tesla-shares-fall-on-elon-musk-stock-price-too-high-tweet/">shares into a free fall</a> — <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nearly 12% in the half-hour following his stock price tweets. The tweet was one of many sent out in rapid fire that day, covering a variety of topics and demands “give people back their freedom” and lines from the U.S. National Anthem to quotes from poet Dylan Thomas and a claim that he will sell all of his possessions. Musk later told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he was not joking and that his tweets were not vetted in advance.</span></p>
<p>The lawsuit revealed Friday alleges that t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he Tesla board has also failed to secure a general counsel “who can provide advice untainted by Musk,” the lawsuit. Three general counsels departed from the company in 2019, which the lawsuit points to as evidence that none were able to exercise independent advice that differed from Musk’s “desired outcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk’s “erratic” actions have caused the company “substantial damage,” including billions of dollars in lost market capitalization, the lawsuit says. </span></p>
<p>The case is Gharrity v. Musk, Del. Ch., No. 2021-0199.</p>

Here, I explore the other side: how nontechnical talent can build relationships with deep tech companies.</p>
<p>Startup hiring processes can be opaque, and breaking into the deep tech world as a nontechnical person seems daunting. As someone with no initial research background wanting to work in biotech, I felt this challenge personally. In the past year, I landed several opportunities working for and with deep tech companies.</p>
<p>Here, I’ll share what I’ve learned and offer tactical advice for finding, reaching out to, cultivating relationships with and working at deep tech companies as a nontechnical candidate.</p>

		<blockquote>
			To find these companies, create news alerts to be notified when companies in deep tech raise new rounds of funding.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Find companies by tracking fundraising</h2>
<p>After startups raise capital, they are ready to spend the new funds on hiring. These companies are more likely to be posting new roles and actively hiring for a wide range of different teams, including nontechnical groups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hackers are exploiting recently discovered vulnerabilities in Exchange email servers to drop ransomware, Microsoft has warned, a move that puts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">tens of thousands of email servers</a> at risk of destructive attacks.</p>
<p>In a tweet late Thursday, the tech giant said <a href="https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1370236539427459076">it had detected</a> the new kind of file-encrypting malware called DoejoCrypt — or DearCry — which uses the same four vulnerabilities that Microsoft linked to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">new China-backed hacking group</a> called Hafnium.</p>
<p>When chained together, the vulnerabilities allow a hacker to take full control of a vulnerable system.</p>
<p>Microsoft said Hafnium was the &#8220;primary&#8221; group exploiting these flaws, likely for espionage and intelligence gathering. But other security firms say they&#8217;ve seen other hacking groups exploit the same flaws. ESET said <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/">at least 10 groups</a> are actively compromising Exchange servers.</p>
<p>Michael Gillespie, a ransomware expert who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/18/stop-djvu-puma-decryption-tools/">develops ransomware decryption tools</a>, said many vulnerable Exchange servers in the U.S., Canada, and Australia had been infected with DearCry.</p>

<p>The new ransomware comes less than a day after a security researcher published proof-of-concept exploit code for the vulnerabilities to Microsoft-owned GitHub. The code was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vpaz/researcher-publishes-code-to-exploit-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-on-github">swiftly removed</a> a short time later for violating the company&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>Marcus Hutchins, a security researcher at Kryptos Logic, said <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1370100513501442051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1370101773470367745%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fgadgets%2F2021%2F03%2Fcritics-fume-after-github-removes-exploit-code-for-exchange-vulnerabilities%2F">in a tweet</a> that the code worked, albeit with some fixes.</p>
<p>Threat intelligence company RiskIQ says it has detected over 82,000 vulnerable servers as of Thursday, but that the number is declining. The company said hundreds of servers belonging to banks and healthcare companies are still affected, as well as more than 150 servers in the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a rapid drop compared to close to 400,000 vulnerable servers when Microsoft first disclosed the vulnerabilities on March 2, the company said.</p>
<p>Microsoft published security fixes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">last week</a>, but the patches do not expel the hackers from already breached servers. Both the FBI and CISA, the federal government&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit, have warned that the vulnerabilities present a major risk to businesses across the United States.</p>
<p>John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at FireEye&#8217;s Mandiant threat intelligence unit, said he anticipates more ransomware groups trying to cash in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though many of the still unpatched organizations may have been exploited by cyber espionage actors, criminal ransomware operations may pose a greater risk as they disrupt organizations and even extort victims by releasing stolen emails,&#8221; said Hultquist.</p>
