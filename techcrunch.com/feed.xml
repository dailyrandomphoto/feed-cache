					<description><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned about battery supply constraints before and the effect it might have on the Tesla Semi. That warning was apparently warranted.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is pushing the launch of its electric Semi truck program to 2022 due to supply chain challenges and the limited availability of battery cells, the company said in its second-quarter earnings report Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned about battery supply constraints before and the effect it might have on the Tesla Semi, which was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2017. Back in January, Musk said the engineering work on the Tesla Semi had been completed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/">deliveries were expected to begin this year</a>. He did add the caveat, at the time, that the availability of battery cells could limit the company&#8217;s ability to produce the Semi.</p>
<p>That warning was apparently warranted. From the shareholders&#8217; letter posted today after the market closed:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.</p>
<p>To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.</p></blockquote>
<p>While not mentioned on the call or in its earnings report, the delay follows the departure of Jerome Guillen, a critical executive at Tesla who was working on the development and eventual production of the Tesla Semi. Guillen’s resignation in June came just three months after he was moved from the president of automotive position, which included oversight of the Tesla Semi, to a role with less responsibility as head of heavy-duty trucking. Guillen had led Tesla’s entire automotive business from September 2018 until March 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production in late 2021, looks like it might be pushed into next year as well. Musk didn&#8217;t answer questions, but comments from Musk as well as Tesla VP of engineering Lars Moravy during the earnings call suggest that it could shift to 2022.</p>
<p>Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages of prototyping, with the basic engineering and architecture of the vehicle completed. While the Model Y takes priority, the company is moving into a beta phase of the Cybertruck later this year, Moravy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking to ramp that in production in Texas after Model Y is up and going,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Musk leaned in on how difficult the Cybertruck would be, perhaps as a way to cushion expectations for its arrival in 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cybertruck ramp will be difficult because it is such a new architecture,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a great product; it might be our best product ever, but it does have a lot of fundamentally new design ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to make the point that he has used as other vehicles have gone from prototype to volume production: Manufacturing is hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the risk of being repetitive, it&#8217;s actually easy to make prototypes or a handful of small-volume production, but anything produced at a high volume, which is really what&#8217;s relevant here, is it&#8217;s going to move as fast as the slowest of the rough order of magnitude of 10,000 unique parts and processes.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Small as it is, the division is selling more energy storage and solar. Revenue from this division grew 62% from the previous quarter and more than 116% from the same quarter in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s primary source of revenue comes from the sale of its electric vehicles, but its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/">latest quarterly earnings report</a> showed growth in its energy storage and solar business.</p>
<p>The demand picture will get even sunnier for the division if the company can access enough chips for its energy storage products, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Tesla on Monday <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">reported</a> $801 million in revenue from its energy generation and storage business &#8212; which includes three main products: solar, its Powerwall storage device for homes and businesses, and its utility storage unit Megapack &#8212; but that&#8217;s just a sliver of the nearly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/"> $12 billion in total revenue</a>. Small as it is, the division is selling more energy storage and solar. Revenue from this division grew 62% from the previous quarter and more than 116% from the same quarter in 2020. Tesla doesn&#8217;t separate solar and energy storage revenue.</p>
<p>More importantly, the cost of revenue for its solar and energy storage business was $781 million, meaning that for the first time the total cost of producing and distributing these energy storage products was lower than the revenue it generated. That&#8217;s good news.</p>
<p>As one might expect, total deployments also rose. Tesla installed 1,274 megawatt-hours of energy storage in the second quarter of 2021, a 205% increase from the same period last year. Similarly, the amount of solar energy deployed in the second quarter of this year was 85 MWh, up 214% from Q2 2020. As a side note: Tesla&#8217;s total solar and energy storage deployments were essentially flat when comparing Q2 2019 and Q2 2020 numbers, likely due to the pandemic&#8217;s general halting of business.</p>
<p>The important nugget is revenue growth. In 2019, Tesla reported $369 million in revenue from solar and storage. Revenue was stagnant in Q2 2020, with $370 million from that business. This quarter was more than double what Tesla brought in during the same quarters of 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>What changed? Besides COVID-19, Tesla points to several Megapack projects coming online and growing popularity in its combined solar and Powerwall product. (Tesla no longer allows customers to order Powerwall without a solar installation.) <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to a configurator on Tesla&#8217;s website, one Megapack is about $1.2 million before taxes. In some states, Tesla says the earliest deliveries will be in 2023.</span></p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s energy storage business is facing headwinds, however. Musk said demand for both the Megapack and the Powerwall both exceed supply, and a backlog is growing. The company is unable to meet that demand because of the global chip shortage, he said.</p>
<p>Tesla uses the same chips in its Powerwall as it does in its vehicles, and Musk said vehicles are the priority while supply is low.</p>
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter">

<div class="c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text">

<div class="p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first">
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section">&#8220;As that significant shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall production,&#8221; Musk said during an earnings call. &#8220;I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year — maybe, on the order of 20,000 a week. Again dependent on cell supply and semiconductors. &#8230; As the world transitions to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent, and by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. And when you look at all the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of backup batteries that are needed.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Musk said in the long term, Tesla and other suppliers would need to produce a combined 1,000 to 2,000 gigawatt-hours per year in order to keep up with energy storage demands. Musk said the company has asked its cell suppliers to double their supply in 2022, a goal that Musk caveated would be dependent on supply chain issues. The company&#8217;s current strategy is to overshoot cell supply and route it outward to its energy storage products, but as in the case of chip shortages, vehicle production would be prioritized, according to Musk.</p>
<h2>Battery cell plans</h2>
<p>While much of the battery cell discussion focused on its 4680 cell that is in development, Musk also touched on Tesla&#8217;s intentions to power some of its products with cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Specifically, he said there&#8217;s a good chance that all stationary storage could move to iron-based batteries and away from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think probably will see a shift, my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel,&#8221; Musk said of Tesla&#8217;s plans. &#8220;And this is actually good because there&#8217;s quite a bit of iron in the world, an insane amount of iron. But there&#8217;s much less nickel and there&#8217;s way less cobalt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one-third of batteries that will remain nickel-based will be used for its longer-range electric vehicles. All of its other EVs would also move to LFP batteries, which is already the case in its vehicles assembled in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung sent out invites for its August 11 Unpacked event last week. While it’s clear this is going to be packed (somewhat ironically) even by the company’s standards, the event may well be as notable for what it doesn’t include. Namely, a slew of rumors have pointed to Samsung skipping its annual Galaxy Note update.</p>
<p>In a blog post today, the company’s president and head of Mobile Communications Business, TM Roh, writes, “Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” The language isn’t entirely clear what that means for the future of Samsung’s beloved – if occasional erratic – phablet. No Note this event? This year? This … ever?</p>
<p>Samsung offered TechCrunch the following clarification, “We will not be launching new Galaxy Note devices in 2021. Instead, Samsung plans to continue to expand the Note experience and bring many of its popular productivity and creativity features, including the S Pen, across our Galaxy ecosystem. We will share more details on our future portfolio once we are ready to announce.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early rumors chalked the lack of a new Note up to supply chain problems that have persisted throughout much of 2020 and 2021. But further speculation has left many wondering whether the company may finally be sunsetting the Galaxy Note series on the eve of its 10th anniversary. Is it possible that the pioneering phablet has run its course, especially as other Samsung flagships get larger and siphon off its biggest features?</p>
<p>What’s clear is that some of the devices announced on the 11th will follow in the footsteps of the Galaxy S21 and bring Note-like features including S-Pen functionality. Likely this means at least the Galaxy Z Fold, confirming earlier rumors that the foldable would be the latest Galaxy device to blur the line between it and the Note. Presumably this also means a further reinforced display for the product. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-leak-shows-how-youll-store-s-pen">Recent leaks</a> point to a carrying case with a pen holster, rather than baking the slot directly into the Fold&#8217;s already complicated design.</p>
<p>“I hope you’ll join us as we debut our next Galaxy Z family and share some foldable surprises — including the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones,” Roh writes. The executive also promises “even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger material” on the new Galaxy Z Flip, while also confirming the arrival of a new Z Fold.</p>
<p>Rounding out the news is a reference to the One UI Watch that appears to confirm that the latest Galaxy Watch will also make a cameo at the upcoming Unpacked.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 26, 2021. Tech news got off to a cracking start this week after the Chinese government spent the weekend rolling out a new regulatory framework for the myriad edtech startups in the country. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">Ant IPO</a> was really just the start of the recent blizzard of changes concerning how China’s government runs its economy. The food delivery market was also impacted recently, along with Tencent Music. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">noodled a bit here</a> on what the situation may mean for the country’s startups. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3 (or so)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/bezos-offers-billions-in-incentives-for-nasas-lunar-lander-contract/">Bezos wants U.S. space contracts:</a> </strong>After retired U.S. billionaire Jeff Bezos recently went up to zero-g for a few minutes, much snark concerning the wealthy spending their fortunes on a vanity space race was tweeted. The flip of that argument is that there’s real-world applications for all the money that Bezos, Branson and Musk are spending. In this case, Bezos is willing to cut the price of Blue Origin’s lunar lander project just to get access to a NASA contract. This is either a neat way to save taxpayer money or some weird sort of corporate bribe. Your call on that one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/box-unwraps-its-answer-to-the-3-8b-e-signature-market-box-sign/">Box wades into the signature wars:</a></strong> The other month, Box, the former startup darling, dropped $55 million on an e-sig company. Now Box is rolling out Box Sign to all its customers for free. The e-sig market is full of big players (DocuSign) and smaller entities (PandaDoc). To see Box offer its e-sig service to existing business customers for no cost means that the software capability is becoming more table stakes than standalone product. Startups take note.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/notco-gets-its-horn-following-235m-round-to-expand-plant-based-food-products/">A new alt-food unicorn:</a></strong> NotCo makes plant-based milks and meats. It just carved itself a fresh slice with a $235 million Series D that values the company at $1.5 billion. We’re highlighting this round because it underscores the amount of capital and, we presume, demand that alternative food products are attracting today. What was a dream just a few years ago is building big startups and even some public companies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/court-orders-us-capitol-rioter-to-unlock-his-laptop-with-his-face/">Keep your password, but show your face:</a></strong> We don&#8217;t often wade into the nuances of the Fifth Amendment, but a judge&#8217;s order out of D.C. caught our eye. Alleged insurrectionist Guy Reffitt was arrested three weeks after the January 6 Capitol riot and faces five federal charges. The FBI seized his laptop, which was password-protected. However, prosecutors said it could be unlocked using Reffitt&#8217;s face. The government used a &#8220;loophole in the Fifth Amendment,&#8221; TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker writes, to compel the use of biometrics to open a Windows laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off our startup news today, make sure you check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/one-of-nigerias-high-profile-angel-investors-is-launching-a-fund-for-african-startups/">this profile of Olumide Soyombo</a>, a Nigerian angel investor who just put together a new fund. Soyombo’s brand-new firm, which he’s dubbed Voltron Capital, intends to invest all over Africa. It’s a potentially huge market for startups and venture capital, so expect more stories like this. How did it come to be? We’re sure that the check that Soyombo wrote to PayStack before Stripe bought it had something to do with it.</p>
<p>As we head into our regular digest of recent funding rounds, one startup sector that is <em>not</em> struggling to attract capital is facial recognition. Sure, you probably find it creepy that companies and agencies are tracking your face without your consent, but that isn’t stopping the financial class from pumping funds into the companies that comprise the facial recognition market. Zack Whittaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/facial-recognition-flush-with-cash/">has the story here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/glyphic-biotechnologies-raises-6m-to-accelerate-protein-sequencing-by-orders-of-magnitude/"><strong>Faster protein sequencing is coming:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news underneath Glyphic Biotechnologies’ new $6 million raise. The company’s tech could massively reduce the time it takes to sequence a protein, possibly unlocking all sorts of things in the health world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/amazon-backed-indian-d2c-beauty-brand-myglamm-raises-71-million/"><strong>Amazon-backed D2C beauty startup raises more:</strong></a><strong> </strong>MyGlamm, an Indian direct-to-consumer company, has added to its capital base to the tune of $47.8 million.

<h2>Data-driven iteration helped China’s Genki Forest become a $6B beverage giant in 5 years</h2>
<p>Many Extra Crunch readers will not have heard of China&#8217;s fastest-growing bottled beverage company: Genki Forest is a direct-to-consumer startup that started selling its sodas, milk teas and other products just five years ago.</p>
<p>Today, its products are available in 40 countries and the company hopes to earn $1.2 billion in 2021. After closing its latest funding round, Genki Forest is valued at $6 billion.</p>
<p>Industry watchers frequently compare the upstart to giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, but founder Binsen Tang comes from a tech background, having funded ELEX Technology, a social gaming company that found success internationally.</p>
<p>“China doesn’t need any more good platforms,” Tang told his team in 2015, “but it does need good products.”</p>
<p>Leveraging China&#8217;s robust distribution network, lighting-fast manufacturing capabilities and a vast pool of data that enables holistic digitization, Genki Forest sells more than 30% of its products online.</p>
<p>“Everything feels right about the company,&#8221; said VC investor Anna Fang. &#8220;The space, the founder, the products and the back end … they exemplify the new Chinese consumer brand.“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reusable rocket startup iRocket has entered into a new partnership with NASA in its quest to reach commercialization in just two years.</p>
<p>The partnership will give iRocket access to testing facilities and engineering support, chiefly at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The company is hoping that it will conduct its first rocket engine test — an on-the-ground engine firing test — at the Huntsville site in September.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irocketusa.com/">iRocket</a> is earmarking $50 million over the next five years for the testing and development of its reusable engines and launch vehicle. Access to NASA facilities also means access to test stands — crucial infrastructure that provides controlled conditions for engine testing. iRocket will be able to conduct vacuum testing (which simulates space conditions) at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio and sea level testing at Marshall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re engaged in very intimate discussions, all the way at the center level, at Marshall Space Flight Center,” iRocket CEO Asad Malik said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The engines in question will eventually power iRocket’s inaugural Shockwave launch vehicles, fully reusable, autonomous small launchers capable of carrying payload with a maximum size of around 300 kg (661 lbs.) and 1,500 kg (around 3,300 lbs.). Manufactured via 3D printing, the engines will be powered by methane and liquid oxygen. “Methane is going to be the fuel of choice for deep space missions,” Malik said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qlXd6b9kJb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/ny-based-autonomous-reusable-rocket-startup-lands-air-force-contract/">NY-based autonomous reusable rocket startup lands Air Force contract</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NY-based autonomous reusable rocket startup lands Air Force contract&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/ny-based-autonomous-reusable-rocket-startup-lands-air-force-contract/embed/#?secret=qlXd6b9kJb" data-secret="qlXd6b9kJb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The New York-based startup is also aiming to make the engines hypersonic capable, an ambitious goal. But iRocket has ambitious plans. Malik wants to turn the company into the premier supplier for both reusable rocket engines and the rockets themselves. Because it’s designing both rocket stages to be reusable as well — a striking difference between it and other rocket developers — Malik said the company could one day not only launch satellites and cargo missions, but also clear space junk or retrieve experiments for biotech companies.</p>
<p>Malik pointed out that the sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne to Lockheed Martin — which is still under review by the Federal Trade Commission — is going to leave a gap in the market. “That’s going to open up the U.S. without an independent rocket supplier at a time when Congress is really pushing hard for us to move away from foreign-bought parts,” he said. “So it’s an opportunity for us to work with the government, the Pentagon, NASA and other partners to develop this next-generation space propulsion capability that we need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">reported</a> Monday an eye-popping $1.14 billion in net income in the second quarter, results that blew past analyst expectations and marked the first time the company&#8217;s quarterly profit (on a GAAP basis) has passed the three-comma threshold. The results pushed shares up more than 2.2% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Tesla was able to beat expectations and log its eighth straight quarter of profitability even as it grappled with supply chain challenges and losses stemming from its bitcoin investment. Operating income was $1.3 billion, which increased year over year from $327 million, due to volume growth and cost reduction, the company said. Those positive results were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, supply chain challenges, lower regulatory credit revenue and the aforementioned bitcoin-related impairment of $23 million.</p>
<p>Supply chain challenges, notably the global shortage of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports, were two factors that affected its business in the second quarter. Tesla noted that it will continue to impact operations and its rate of delivery growth in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year,&#8221; the company said in its shareholder deck released Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla reported revenue of $11.96 billion, a nearly 100% increase from the $6.04 billion it generated in the second quarter of 2020. Revenue in the second quarter was also higher than last quarter&#8217;s total of $10.39 billion. Analysts surveyed by Factset estimated $11.4 billion in revenue and $600 million in profit.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s automotive revenue was $10.2 billion in the second quarter. Notably, only $354 million of that automotive revenue came from the sale of regulatory credits, 17% lower than last quarter and the lowest in the past four quarters. Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s automotive gross margins popped to 28.4%, a historic high for the metric.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Q2 net income of $1.14 billion compared favorably with the $104 million worth net income in the same period last year, a gain just shy of 1,000%. That record-setting number is nearly three times more its Q1 2021 net income of $438 million. Tesla’s adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $2.24 billion in the quarter, up from $1.21 billion in the same year-ago period, a gain of roughly 100%.</p>
<p>Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents decreased to $16.2 billion in the second quarter, according to Tesla, which said that decrease was driven mainly by net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6 billion, partially offset by free cash flow of $619 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tesla reported its produced 206,421 vehicles in the second quarter. Of those, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, nearly 9% more than the first quarter of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, the neighborhood crime-watch app Citizen <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">offered its user base $30,000</a> to track down a suspected arsonist on live video, only to discover that they&#8217;d sent a mob of civilians after the wrong guy. Now, Citizen is covertly hiring journalists to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">livestream on the app at crime scenes</a> for $25 per hour through third-party websites. I&#8217;m tired.</p>
<p>When Citizen first hit the App Store in 2016, it was called Vigilante — it marketed itself as a platform to <a href="https://citizen-app.medium.com/vigilante-manifesto-e665696a4ebb#.g2di4nexy">fight injustice with transparency</a>, which might sound good in theory, but in practice, it deliberately encouraged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store">seek out crime scenes</a> to report them. Vigilante was removed from the App Store for violating a clause in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple&#8217;s App Developer Review Guidelines</a> that an app shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;likely to cause physical harm from its use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely, this would be the end for the nascent platform. But like a cockroach after an apocalypse, the app chugged on. It rebranded itself as Citizen, added disclaimers that no one should interfere with a crime scene, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/?_ga=2.175516256.336873417.1550176258-1373501013.1516818895">reentered the App Store</a>, and continued to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/citizen-app-crime-sequoia-san-francisco-12-million-series-a/">raise VC funding</a>. Now, the app is like a crowd-sourced crime blotter — as its App Store page says, &#8220;Citizen may notify you of a crime in progress before the police have responded.&#8221; But this level of hypervigilance can <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/justinbrannan/nyc-brooklyn-safe-citizen-app-freakout">fuel panic</a>, rather than make people feel safe — not to mention that user-reported crime incidents might be incorrect at best, and racist at worst. The app pulls data from 911 calls, but not all information in those dispatches are verified, which can be cause for false concern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But Citizen can only function if it has enough of a user base, and its attempts to corral civilians to use the app have gotten more and more desperate. According to SensorTower, the app hit a monthly download high in June 2020, in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests. (So, as the country protested police brutality, 677,000 people responded by downloading a policing app). But the following month, just 207,000 people downloaded the app. Since then, growth has been pretty stagnant — 292,000 people downloaded Citizen in March 2020, and 283,000 people downloaded it in March 2021.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/citizen-app-landon/">the Daily Dot reported</a> that one specific user named &#8220;Landon&#8221; was livestreaming from multiple crime scenes in one day, attempting to interview witnesses and first responders — given how often he seemed to stumble upon these crime scenes, it seemed unlikely that he was just an enthusiastic app user. Yesterday, the New York Post reported on another user named &#8220;Chris&#8221; who livestreamed on Citizen from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">six emergencies in one day</a>. Citizen confirmed that both Landon and Chris were working for the app as members of its Street Team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Citizen has teams in place in some of the cities where the app is available to demonstrate how the platform works, and to model responsible broadcasting practices in situations when events are unfolding in real time. We believe these teams will ultimately help guide our users on how to broadcast in an effective, helpful and safe way,&#8221; a Citizen spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Citizen has had Street Teams since the app&#8217;s launch; a spokesperson said that they&#8217;ve never tried to hide this. But these jobs are not listed on the Citizen website. Instead, they&#8217;re listed by a third-party recruiter called Flyover Entertainment on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210722213718/https://www.journalismjobs.com/1666655-field-reporter--street-team-lead-flyover-entertainment">JournalismJobs board</a> without mention of Citizen. An NYU Journalism website shared <a href="https://careerservices.nyujournalism.org/job/2021-07-16/field-reporter-street-team-leads/">a similar listing</a>, which did include the Citizen name. Citizen confirmed to TechCrunch that both of these listings are for the app&#8217;s Street Team. Citizen pays $250 per day for a 10-hour shift in LA, and $200 per day for an 8-hour shift in NYC, which comes out to $25 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broadcast journalists have experience in broadcasting safely and responsibly. This is a requisite for our Street Team members,&#8221; said the Citizen spokesperson. When asked why these jobs were posted on third-party job boards, but not Citizen&#8217;s own website, the spokesperson reiterated that it was because Citizen specifically wanted to find journalists. However, it could presumably also find journalists on its own website.</p>
<p>Surveillance state vigilantism concerns aside, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/local-news-is-dying-and-americans-have-no-idea/585772/">local news is dying</a>, and Citizen is not built to be a substitute for neighborhood journalism. Sure, local newspapers report on crime too, and it&#8217;s not as though Citizen is doing something unprecedented by sending reporters to scope out crime scenes. But there&#8217;s a difference between reporting news and livestreaming from a crime scene on a surveillance app that only discloses who is a paid worker and who is an average civilian when directly asked. For an app that is modeled on &#8220;<a href="https://citizen.com/">increasing transparency</a>,&#8221; these covert job postings don&#8217;t feel so transparent. Plus, for an infrequent freelance gig with no benefits or paid time off that requires established broadcasting skills, $25 per hour is a pretty bad rate.</p>
<p>Now, Citizen&#8217;s latest attempt at growth is a paid service for $19.99 per month called Protect, which lets users send their location and a livestream from their camera to a Protect Agent. Citizen says its Protect Agents include former law enforcement officers and 911 operators, who can send an &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">instant emergency response</a>&#8221; in case of emergency. This sort of seems like paying to get a personal 911 operator, which, again, feels like a poor alternative to policing, an already poor system.</p>
<p>Maybe Silicon Valley-bred tech companies aren&#8217;t the answer to the United States&#8217; centuries-long crises of police brutality, racial profiling and surveillance. Maybe a better way to reduce crime is to ensure that all people have access to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/03/new-evidence-that-access-to-health-care-reduces-crime/">health care</a>, <a href="https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/53294/theeffectsofunemploymentoncimerates.pdf">jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/homes/rent-affordability-minimum-wage/index.html">affordable housing</a>. Who knows!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Duolingo is now targeting a $95 to $100 per share IPO price range, up from $85 to $95 per share, or a gain of around 12% at the bottom and 5% at the top.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. edtech company Duolingo released a revised IPO price range this morning, boosting its potential per-share value to $100 after initially targeting a range that topped out at $95 per share.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001562088/000162828021014402/duolingos-1a2upsize_new.htm">unicorn&#8217;s SEC filings</a>, Duolingo is now targeting a $95 to $100 per share IPO price range, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">up from $85 to $95 per share</a>, or a gain of around 12% at the bottom and 5% at the top.</p>
<p>TechCrunch previously called the Duolingo debut a bellwether of sorts for the larger U.S. edtech ecosystem; if Duolingo can price and trade well, investors in private companies may be more willing to invest, given a more proven and attractive exit market. On the other hand, if Duolingo prices weakly or trades poorly, the company could place a wet blanket atop the startup edtech world.</p>
<p>The fact that Duolingo is raising its IPO price range indicates that we are more likely on the path for a strong offering than a weak one.</p>
<p>For edtech companies that have hit unicorn status &#8212; like Masterclass, Course Hero, Quizlet and Outschool &#8212; it&#8217;s good news. For reference, those companies have raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/masterclass">$461.4 million</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursehero">$97.4 million</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quizlet">$62 million</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/outschool">$130 million</a>, respectively, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Duolingo worth?</h2>
<p>The terms of the company&#8217;s IPO have not changed, aside from its proposed price. So, Duolingo is still selling 3.7 million shares in its debut, and some 1.41 million shares will be sold by existing equity holders. The company&#8217;s underwriters also reserved their right to buy 765,916 shares of the company&#8217;s stock at IPO price in the 30 days following its debut.</p>
<p>At the upper and lower bands of the company&#8217;s IPO price, its simple valuation excluding underwriter shares now lands between $3.41 billion and $3.59 billion. Inclusive of its greenshoe offering, those numbers rise to $3.48 billion and $3.67 billion.</p>
<p>Recall that when private, Duolingo&#8217;s November 2020 Series H valued the company at just over $2.4 billion. So long as Duolingo prices in its range, it will provide investors with a nice bump in the value of their investment. Duolingo was valued at just $1.6 billion in mid-2020, indicating that it has more than doubled in value since that investment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Despite the plentiful headlines about mega billion-dollar M&amp;A transactions, record IPOs and the rapid growth of SPACs, small deals will continue to be the most likely exit for the vast majority of tech startups. In the over 30 years I&#8217;ve worked on M&amp;A at White &amp; Case, Barclays and my current firm Ascento Capital, I have seen too many startups that are not prepared for an exit via a merger or sale. This article will provide specific recommendations on how to prepare your startup for M&amp;A.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While it is good to strive for a billion-dollar-plus sale, a successful IPO or a SPAC deal, it is practical to prepare your startup for a smaller transaction.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Global M&amp;A hit record highs in the second quarter with a total deal value of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/dealmakers-drown-deals-second-quarter-ma-frenzy-2021-07-01/">$1.5 trillion</a>, but smaller transactions vastly outnumber mega billion-dollar deals. The U.S. saw a total of 16,672 deals in the year ended June 31, but only 583, or 3% of that number, were valued at more than a billion dollars (<a href="https://www.factset.com/hubfs/mergerstat_em/monthly/US-Flashwire-Monthly.pdf">FactSet</a>). The IPO market is healthy again, but M&amp;A still represents 88% of exits: So far this year, there were 503 IPOs and 5,203 deals, according to the CB Insights Q2 2021 <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">State of Venture Report</a>. After the SEC announced in early April that it was considering new guidance on SPAC IPOs, the rate of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevindowd/2021/07/04/a-perfect-storm-record-breaking-ma-a-spac-slowdown-antitrust-action-media-mega-mergers-and-more-from-a-frantic-first-half-of-deals-in-2021/?sh=6ebfb01a1dc5">new SPAC issuances fell by around 90%</a>.</p>
<p>While it is good to strive for a billion-dollar-plus sale, a successful IPO or a SPAC deal, it is practical to prepare your startup for a smaller transaction.</p>
<p>Here are a few recommendations that will prepare your startup for an M&amp;A exit:</p>
<h2>Track M&amp;A in your subsector</h2>
<p>Set up an alert on <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> for M&amp;A activity in your subsector. For example, if your startup is in the IoT subsector, search for &#8220;IoT acqui&#8221; and this will pick up news stories on acquisitions in the IoT space. Save the search so you can go to Google News on a regular basis. Also track your closest competitors on Google News, particularly to see who is selling their company.</p>
<h2>Prepare a list of likely acquirers</h2>
<p>Prepare a list of the companies or firms most likely to buy your startup. This list should include domestic and international companies, businesses in non-tech industries, private equity firms and their portfolio companies, as well as VC-backed companies. Track these likely acquirers on Google News as well.</p>
<h2>Consider executing a parallel track</h2>
<p>Consider approaching the top 10 likely acquirers when you are raising the next round of capital. If your startup gets M&amp;A offers and VC term sheets at the same time, this will provide your board of directors choices on the path ahead. Knowing the M&amp;A activity in your startup’s subsector and the 10 most likely acquirers will impress VCs and increase the chances of being funded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The whole human proteome may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">free to browse thanks to DeepMind</a>, but at the bleeding edge of biotech new proteins are made and tested every day, a complex and time-consuming process. <a href="https://glyphic.bio/">Glyphic Biotechnologies</a> accelerates the critical but slow sequencing step, potentially cutting drug development times down by a huge amount, and the startup just raised a $6 million seed to bring its clever solution to market.</p>
<p>Proteins are at the heart of many new treatments and products; the ubiquitous and infinitely varied chains of amino acids twist into shapes that interact with cells, substances in the body, and other proteins, doing everything from interpreting DNA to controlling access to secure areas (&#8220;sorry, no potassium allowed&#8221;).</p>
<p>In the drug discovery and biotech world, proteins represent unlimited possibility — the right one could clamp onto cancer cells, facilitate natural healing processes, or prompt the creation of helpful substances. But finding and testing novel molecules is not easy — and a big part of that is sequencing, which confirms the exact makeup of the protein you&#8217;re trying to test.</p>
<p>Right now there are several large companies doing good business in the protein discovery world, and generally the process involves identifying the amino acid at the end of the protein chain, then snipping it off, identifying the next one, and so on until you&#8217;ve done the whole thing.</p>
<p>The trouble with this approach is that the protein&#8217;s shape or the molecular properties of the next amino acid in line can interfere with the process of binding to and identifying the one on the very end. As a result there&#8217;s a certain amount of uncertainty and a lack of unreliability inherent to the process.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rr73pY9OCy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=Rr73pY9OCy" data-secret="Rr73pY9OCy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Glyphic Biotechnologies changes that by adding a step where the target amino acid is detached <em>first</em> and then tethered nearby using a novel molecule called ClickP developed by one of the co-founders. A single stationary amino acid attached to a known molecule is much, much easier to identify, and when it&#8217;s done, the process repeats as before.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s briefly stated but the advance is significant. Current techniques in the antibody discovery space produce and inspect on the order of tens of thousands of proteins per week per (very expensive) machine. It sounds like a lot but with proteins essentially innumerable, it&#8217;s just a drop in the bucket. Even running 24/7 this rate doesn&#8217;t come close to satisfying demand.</p>
<p>Glyphic&#8217;s approach, utilizing ClickP and single-molecule microscopy (like that used by DNA sequencing giant Illumina), should be capable of millions to tens of millions per week, possibly climbing to billions in time. Even at the most conservative estimate you&#8217;re talking about orders of magnitude in improvement — those tens of thousands in the other techniques include lots of (perhaps mostly) repeat or junk information due to their use of B cell cultivation to produce the antibodies in question.</p>

<p>Not only that, but because the ClickP process avoids the problem of interference from the next amino acid in the chain, it has way, way higher specificity and confidence. So you wouldn&#8217;t just be sequencing a hundred or a thousand times as many proteins, you&#8217;d be far more sure about the results.</p>
<p>At first Glyphic would be processing samples sent to them, but ultimately their tech could live in other labs as their competitors do now. Going from service to hardware sales and support is the current roadmap.</p>
<p>If everything works as advertised, Glyphic could be the new standard in protein sequencing just as demand skyrockets in the biotech world. To do so, though, it needs just a bit more time in the incubator.</p>
<p>The process they pioneered was the result of work done by co-founders Joshua Yang (CEO) and Daniel Estandian (CTO) at the lab of MIT&#8217;s Ed Boyden (on the team as &#8220;scientific founder&#8221;).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182011" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182011" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182011" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg 1244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182011" class="wp-caption-text">CTO Daniel Estandian, left, and CEO Josh Yang. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Glyphic Biotechnologies</p></div></p>
<p>Yang explained that what stands between them and potential industry dominance is a mere matter of chemical engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder [Estandian] developed ClickP himself. The chemistry works,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But as a spinout of an academic lab, we didn&#8217;t develop all 20 binders, because it would have bankrupted the lab. This isn&#8217;t an &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; molecule.&#8221;</p>
<p>These binders are a bit like adapters that make the process work for each of the 20 amino acids. It takes time and money to engineer them, so they decided to show the system off with a handful first in order to get the cash to make the rest. &#8220;It&#8217;s really just about putting the time into getting them out there,&#8221; said Yang.</p>
<p>The $6.025 million seed round should finance the company through this early stage as it builds its platform. It was led by OMX ventures (which previously invested in 10X Genomics and Twist Bioscience), with participation from Osage University Partners, Wing VC, Artis Ventures, Cantos Ventures, Civilization Ventures, and Axial VC, and has an angel investor in Mammoth Biosciences CEO Trevor Martin.</p>

<p>Glyphic will be making its first home at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/berkeley-has-a-big-new-biotech-incubator-in-bakar-labs/">Bakar Labs, the freshly inaugurated new Berkeley biotech incubator</a>. There it will stay until it&#8217;s ready to take the next big step, likely hardware manufacturing next year on the back of an A round to be raised then. 2022 should then also see the company&#8217;s first paid services. And the antibody market, as large as it is, is only the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antibodies are just a starting point, as numerous applications can benefit from protein sequencing,&#8221; Josh explained in an email after we spoke. &#8220;Another high value area is in industrial biotechnology, where protein-sequencing-based screening of evolved enzymes can help identify enhanced or novel functions (e.g., better laundry detergents, waste-water treatment). Development of diagnostic tests would also benefit because, the more proteins you can sequence and identify in a sample set, the increased likelihood you can identify rare yet important biomarkers and/or develop a robust panel of biomarkers that together can detect or predict disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>A company like Glyphic may seem like a perfect target to get snapped up by one of the more deep-pocketed competitors out there, but Yang said they&#8217;re confident enough to ride it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The activity in this space is insane. My co-founder and I really want to be the next Illumina or 10X Genomics — we really want to be that leader in proteomics.&#8221; And unless the competition has a few cards hidden up their sleeves, Yang&#8217;s ambition seems like a distinct possibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MyGlamm, a direct-to-consumer beauty brand in India that sells most of its products through its own website, app and retail touch points, said on Monday it has raised $71.3 million in a financing round as the Mumbai-headquartered firm looks to scale its business across the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The startup had raised $23.5 million in its four-times subscribed Series C financing round from Amazon, Ascent Capital and Wipro in March this year. On Monday, it said it has added an additional $47.8 million as part of the round &#8212; which is now closed.</p>
<p>Accel led the investment in the new tranche while existing MyGlamm investors &#8212; Bessemer Venture Partners, L’Occitane, Ascent, Amazon, Mankekar family, Trifecta and Strides Ventures &#8212; also participated, Darpan Sanghvi, founder and chief executive of MyGlamm, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sanghvi started <a href="https://www.myglamm.com">MyGlamm</a> in 2017 after pivoting his previous venture. He recalled the struggle he faced raising money for a direct-to-consumer brand, which were not as popular in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market just five years ago. To make matters worse, MyGlamm was also among the last direct-to-consumer startups to kick off its journeys at the time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182027" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182027" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182027 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1041" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182027" class="wp-caption-text">MyGlamm website. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MyGlamm</p></div></p>
<p>The startup today operates as a house of brands in the beauty and personal care spaces. “We operate across makeup, skincare, haircare, bath and body, and personal care. Unlike other brands, we have been able to successfully build a master brand across categories,” he said over a video call.</p>
<p>“The reason we have been able to build this is because we are truly direct to consumers. This allows us to communicate very directly with them,” he said, adding that most other firms in the industry are too reliant on third-party marketplaces for their sales.</p>
<p>He attributed the recent growth of the startup, which sells over 800 SKUs across categories (up from 600 in March), to its newfound user acquisition strategy. In August, the startup acquired POPxo, a startup that has built a community around content, influencers and commerce and serves over 60 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>“The content to the commerce engine has become our biggest moat,” he said. “We are acquiring 250,000 new users each month without spending any real money.”</p>
<p>POPxo, which is run by Priyanka Gill, engages with nearly 300,000 users each month, gathering their feedback and ideas for new products. Gill said in a video call that “in this line of business, CAC (cost of customer acquisition) is the game and POPxo has solved this problem,” she said, adding that POPxo, which is run like a fairly independent business, is on track to reach over 100 million users by March next year.</p>
<p>The startup also has 15,000 point-of-sale touch points in the physical world across India. The physical presence, which accounts for 40% of the revenue it generates today, “has been crucial to scale in the country,” Sanghvi said.</p>
<p>“We believe that the time is ripe for building out digital-first CPG brands with a deep focus on content-to-commerce,” said Anand Daniel, partner at Accel, in a statement.</p>
<p>“COVID has only cemented this belief. The unique combination of content coupled with a compelling product line gave us the conviction to lead this round in MyGlamm. We are excited to partner with Darpan, Priyanka and the MyGlamm team and look forward to building out the next-generation CPG giant,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its product development, data science and technology research teams. It is also working to expand its offline presence and broadening the digital reach of POPxo.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Last week, Tribe Capital&#8217;s investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/indias-blackbuck-valued-at-1-billion-in-67-million-fundraise/">crowned BlackBuck as India&#8217;s 16th unicorn this year</a>, compared to 11 last year and six in 2019. Food delivery startup Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar stock market debut last week</a> and financial services firms MobiKwik and Paytm have also filed for their IPOs. Insurance aggregator service PolicyBazaar and online beauty e-commerce firm Nykaa are also expected to file their paperwork for an IPO in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar plans to launch in nine more markets this year, doubling its global presence as it seeks to sell more of its electric sedans.</p>
<p>The company, which is the electric performance vehicle brand under Volvo Car Group, said it is also planning to double the number of retail stores to 100 locations and add more service centers by the end of the year. Some of the retail locations will be temporary pop-up stores. The Swedish automaker has more than 650 so-called &#8220;service points&#8221; in Polestar markets and wants to exceed 780 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Polestar launched last year in the U.S., China, Canada, Belgium, Germany, UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. By the end of the year, the company plans to be in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically within the United States, Polestar has service centers and retail stores in Austin, Bellevue, Washington, Boston, Detroit, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Princeton, New Jersey, San Francisco, San Jose and Scottsdale, Arizona. Polestar plans to add locations in Orange County, California, central New Jersey, Charlotte, North Carolina and Grapevine, Texas.</p>
<p>This pace of expansion doesn&#8217;t appear to be waning. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement that the company aims to expand at a similar rate in terms of new markets in 2022. &#8220;This continued pace, combined with new retail concepts, will support our goal to exceed our owners&#8217; expectations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today, Polestar has one primary product: the all-electric Polestar 2. But it has plans to add more to its portfolio in the coming years. The automaker announced in June that it would manufacture its first all-electric SUV in the United States. The SUV, which is called the Polestar 3, will be assembled at a plant shared with Volvo Cars at a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Polestar 3 follows the all-electric Polestar 2 sedan and the hybrid grand tourer Polestar 1. Production of Polestar 3 is expected to begin globally in 2022.</p>
<p>As Polestar scales up, it&#8217;s keen to find new ways to reach customers. The main strategy is to add more retail stores and expand in existing markets or into new ones. The company said Monday it is also experimenting with a new concept called Polestar Destinations. These &#8220;destinations&#8221; act just likes its &#8220;Polestar Spaces&#8221; stores, but are larger and located outside of urban centers. These destination stores will also act as centers where customers can pick up their vehicles, which can be ordered and paid for online.</p>
<p>The company is also adding 60 more test drive locations by the end of 2021 to provide additional access to Polestar 2 vehicles.</p>
<p>All of this expansion is being supported by an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/polestar-raises-500m-from-outside-investors-as-ev-market-grows/">influx of $550 million</a> that Polestar raised in April in an external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated in that round.</p>
<p>While this was Polestar&#8217;s first external round, the company suggested at the time that it wouldn&#8217;t be the last.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; raspy, deep voice helped her raise more than $700 million for her now-defunct company, Theranos. When I step into any boardroom for a pitch, I can hear her croaking her <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2197299-elizabeth-holmes-the-hypnotic-tale-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-theranos/#ixzz702xCxlA8">favorite line</a>: &#8220;I hope that less people will have to say goodbye too soon to people that they love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting across from a venture partner, I wonder if they might feel more compelled by my words if I cut my hair short (really short), or grew a beard, or removed my pregnant belly. Would they take out their checkbook if I were more aggressive in what I promised? Would they be more interested in getting to know my business and me better if I passionately slammed the table?</p>
<p>Actually, very likely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holmes <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-deep-voice-2019-3%3Famp">adopted a ridiculously low voice</a> to get her startup off the ground in a world full of men. She promised impossible pinprick tests to detect hundreds of diseases and collected influential investors like Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Mattis and Betsy DeVos. She wore a Steve Jobs uniform &#8212; including the Issey Miyake turtleneck &#8212; and built a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/former-employees-theranos-explain-themselves-110149347.html">team of 800 brilliant people</a>. Did she go overboard with her lies? Yes. But she&#8217;s not the only one. The Silicon Valley and venture landscape only exacerbated whatever beliefs she already had in her company and inclinations to promise the moon.</p>
<p>Last week at a virtual hearing, she <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-renews-fight-to-constrain-prosecutors-11625693675">pushed</a> to keep a huge database of information protected from the government. Before that, she <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-sec-charges-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-with-massive-frau.html">claimed</a> to have made $100 million in revenue in 2014, when it was really $100,000. These things, among others, are hands-down inexcusable. But I still believe that she thought she was doing the right thing taking the universal advice of Silicon Valley: &#8220;Fake it till you make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She once <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/15/theranos-ceo-fires-back-at-wsj-i-was-shocked.html">said, </a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-2315880316">borrowing</a> from previous thought leaders: &#8220;This is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you&#8217;re crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world.&#8221; I wonder if she just thinks she&#8217;s now on part two.</p>
<p>Raising money to start a company is about two things: having connections and making an appearance. Connections are <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">difficult</a> to make when you&#8217;re a woman: &#8220;Only about 12% of decision-makers at VC firms are women, and most firms still don’t have a single female partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even if you have connections, building relationships can be a bit weird: My cofounders end up being text buddies with our investors, while I hear news of things in passing. We hit a peak of 2.8% of funding going to women-led startups in 2019, but in 2020, that <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">dropped</a> again to 2.3%, possibly because investors reverted to their standard habits of keeping their cards close during uncertain times. Furthermore, investors generally have expectations that are aligned with male tendencies. For example, identical slides and scripts that are read by men and women are judged very differently, with <a href="https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/investors-prefer-entrepreneurial-ventures-pitched-attractive-men">men overwhelmingly rated higher</a>. Holmes’ deep voice, although off-putting, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347212004769?via%3Dihub">probably made her more convincing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to replicate the fundraising success that Holmes had, though. If other women tried to emulate this, they&#8217;d likely be penalized: In general, forward men are viewed positively as assertive, while forward women are viewed as <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/we-recorded-vcs-conversations-and-analyzed-how-differently-they-talk-about-female-entrepreneurs">emotionally unstable</a>. This is confusing because, inversely, if women <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/research-investors-punish-entrepreneurs-for-stereotypically-feminine-behaviors">retreat</a> to stereotypically feminine behaviors, they are viewed as weak. Hillary Clinton got stuck in this during her presidential race &#8212; criticized for being aggressive and cold when stereotypically masculine traits and pegged as weak when showing stereotypically feminine traits.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it turns out that in pitches, women are <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">asked</a> more preventative questions about potential loss and risk, while men are asked more promotional questions about upside and gains. Women can <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/how-the-vc-pitch-process-is-failing-female-entrepreneurs">work around this</a> by answering any preventative question in the positive. Holmes knew this deep down and played into it. That was the only way for her to win.</p>
<p>I am absolutely no <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a36806930/elizabeth-holmes-fans-tikt-tok/">&#8220;holmie,&#8221;</a> but I do understand firsthand her need to role-play. I&#8217;ve been overlooked; hell, I&#8217;ve even been told to change my product line (bras) because venture capitalists won&#8217;t get it. And they didn&#8217;t. I gave in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to defend her, and I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s so easy to drop a line at a party or a board meeting about how obnoxious she was in her venture, but what irks me is that we focus on her specifically as the problem, completely bypassing the environment that created her. I remember soaking up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood:_Secrets_and_Lies_in_a_Silicon_Valley_Startup">John Carreyrou&#8217;s tantalizing book</a> thinking, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;ll never do that,&#8221; as I started my company. But as I have seen the pressures and the biases, I can see how the system shaped Holmes.</p>
<p>Why don’t we judge the biased system we created as much as we judge the person it destroyed? She sticks out like a sore thumb because, well, how many Elizabeth Holmeses are there out there? These problems are so ingrained in the system itself, though, that as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI">David Foster Wallace alluded to in the water speech</a>, we can&#8217;t see them and we probably aren&#8217;t ready to repair them.</p>
<p>The next time someone jokes at a cocktail party about Holmes’ baritone voice, just remind them how dumb is it that we give more money to people with deep voices.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The former Lucid Motors will expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet and aims to ultimately produce 400,000 vehicles a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group (formerly Lucid Motors) will be expanding its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet, CEO Pete Rawlinson said Monday just hours after the company officially went public with a $4.5 billion injection of capital.</p>
<p>The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.</p>
<p>Part of the expansion will be used to accommodate the manufacturing of Project Gravity, the mysterious title given to the automaker’s forthcoming luxury electric SUV, a Lucid spokesman told TechCrunch. Not much is known about Gravity at this point, other than that it’s scheduled to be available from 2023 and that it will use the same battery platform as the Air. Patent drawings submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, first noticed by a member of the <a href="https://www.lucid-forum.com/threads/lucid-gravity-suv-patent-images-reveal-production-design.142/">Lucid Forum</a>, reveal little more than the renderings on Lucid’s website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also planning on bringing more of the component production in-house, including major pieces such as the body panel stampings, the spokesman added. These parts were being handled by an external supplier.</p>
<p>The Casa Grande City Council approved the plans to expand the nearly 1 million-square-foot space in March. The first phase of the factory, which cost around $700 million to construct, went up in a record 12 months after breaking ground. Lucid has said that it wants to expand production capacity from around 30,000 vehicles per year to up to 400,000.</p>
<p>Lucid has had a long, sometimes tenuous road to the public market. The company first set its sights on bringing an electric sedan to production as early as 2018, but it quickly hit funding challenges that pushed this timeline further and further back. Lucid received major funding in 2018 with a $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which continued to be its largest shareholder throughout Lucid&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/"> merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.</p>
<p>That merger hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">a bit of a hiccup</a> last week when the company failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on a key proposal &#8212; likely due to the rise of retail traders and malfunctioning spam filters, executives said in an investor call.</p>
<p>Lucid, which will now operate under the name Lucid Group, is listed under the ticker symbol LCID.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five weeks after Lordstown Motors issued a warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its electric pickup truck to market, a hedge fund managed by investment firm Yorkville Advisors has agreed to buy $400 million worth of shares over a three-year period, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021009220/ride-20210723x8k.htm">regulatory filing posted</a> Monday.</p>
<p>The tumult within Lordstown Motors, which has resulted in the resignation of its CEO and CTO, has put the company at risk of failing. This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle. If approved by shareholders, hedge fund YA II PN will be able to purchase 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares.</p>
<p>The capital provides a lifeline to Lordstown, which has struggled in recent months. The hedge fund, which is able to buy the shares at $7.48 a share, could also benefit financially if the stock price rises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of former CEO Steve Burns&#8217; other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.</p>
<p>The Ohio automaker was founded in 2019, and within a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">reached a deal to merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. The company had planned to begin production of its Endurance pickup truck starting in the second half of 2021 at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Those plans faltered and a series of missteps and allegations of fraud compounded the company&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has &#8220;no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hindenburg disputed that the company booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller said that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company&#8217;s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/">attempting to calm investors</a> a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/"> company retracted those statements</a> within days.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice and the SEC are separately<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"> investigating the company</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The FBI argued that compelling Guy Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it 'would not run afoul of the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered a man accused of participating in the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6 to unlock his laptop &#8220;with his face&#8221; after prosecutors argued that the laptop likely contains video footage that would incriminate him in the attempted insurrection.</p>
<p>Guy Reffitt was arrested in late January, three weeks after he participated in the riot, and has been in jail since. He has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including bringing a firearm to the Capitol grounds and a charge of obstructing justice. His Windows laptop was one of several devices seized by the FBI, which investigators said was protected with a password but could be unlocked using Reffitt&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said forensic evidence suggested that the laptop contained gigabytes of footage from Reffitt&#8217;s helmet-worn camera that he allegedly used to record some of the riot. Prosecutors asked the court if it could compel Reffitt to sit in front of the computer to unlock it.</p>
<p>Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told the court that his client could &#8220;not remember&#8221; the password, but the court sided with the government and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21016668-us-vs-reffitt">granted the motion to compel</a> his biometrics. Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told CNN, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/politics/capitol-rioter-unlock-laptop/index.html">first reported the court order</a>, that the laptop is now unlocked.</p>
<p>The government took advantage of a loophole in the Fifth Amendment, which grants anyone in the U.S. the right to remain silent, including the right to not turn over information that could implicate them in a crime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/court-police-suspects-passwords/">such as a password</a>. But some courts have ruled that those protections don&#8217;t extend to a person&#8217;s physical attributes that can be used in place of a password, such as a face scan or fingerprint.</p>
<p>In Reffitt&#8217;s indictment, the FBI said as much, arguing that compelling Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it &#8220;would not run afoul of the defendant&#8217;s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courts across the U.S. are still divided on the reading of the Fifth Amendment and whether it applies to the compelled use of a person&#8217;s biometrics. The U.S. Supreme Court isn&#8217;t likely to address the issue any time soon, rejecting two petitions in as many years to rule on the matter, leaving it largely up to the states to decide.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-22-brain-scanning-helmet.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">helmets</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-penn-medicine-brain-tumor-ai-151105509.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">AI</a> that can spot brain tumors, but a new hard hat can actually treat them, too.</p>
<p>As part of the latest neurological <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/investigational-magnetic-device-shrinks-glioblastoma-in-first-in-world-human-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">breakthrough</a>, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately died due to an unrelated injury, but an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31% of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.</p>
<p>The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day. During the period, the patient&#8217;s tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The inventors of the device — which received Food and Drug Administration approval for compassionate use treatment — claim it could one day help treat brain cancer without radiation or chemotherapy.</p>
<p>“Our results &#8230; open a new world of non-invasive and nontoxic therapy &#8230; with many exciting possibilities for the future,” said David S. Baskin, corresponding author and director of the Kenneth R. Peak Center for Brain and Pituitary Tumor Treatment in the Department of Neurosurgery at Houston Methodist Neurological Institute. Details of the procedure have been published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.708017/full?utm_source=F-NTF&amp;utm_medium=EMLX&amp;utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Frontiers in Oncology</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Things in China seem to be changing for the worse, in terms of both future access to foreign capital for Chinese companies and doing business in the country overall.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">spent a little time</a> on Friday ruminating on the impact of then-rumored regulation in China targeting its edtech sector. News that the Chinese government intended to crack down further on the education technology market hit shares of public, China-based edtech companies. It was a mess.</p>
<p>Then over the weekend, the rumors became reality, and the impact is still being felt today in the global markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more. China is also bringing new regulatory pressure on food-delivery companies and Tencent Music. More precisely, we&#8217;ve seen successive market-dynamic-changing moves from the Chinese government in the last few days, coming as 2021 had already proved to be a turbulent environment for China-based technology companies.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Today we have to do a little bit of work to understand precisely what is going on with the various regulatory changes. Why? Because the Chinese venture capital market is a <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/q2-2021-chinese-inbound-investment-announced-ma-transactions-and-equity-investments/">key player in the global venture scene</a>. And Chinese startups have gone public on both Chinese, Hong Kong and U.S. exchanges; there&#8217;s a lot of capital tied up in companies impacted today &#8212; and possibly tomorrow.</p>
<p>For startups, the regulatory changes aren&#8217;t a death blow; indeed, many Chinese tech startups won&#8217;t be affected by what we&#8217;ve seen thus far. And upstart tech companies in sectors less likely to be targeted by central authorities may become more attractive to investors than they were before the regulatory onslaught kicked off. But on the whole, it feels like the risk profile of doing business in China has risen. That could curb the pace at which capital is invested, cut valuations and lower interest in the Chinese startup market from private-market investors able to invest globally.</p>

We want to better understand today&#8217;s Chinese startup market and what its new form could mean for existing players and future performance.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>The edtech clampdown did not start last week. China&#8217;s edtech sector started to rack up penalties and fines in June, which led to what <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2021/06/chinas-next-big-regulatory-clampdown-edtech/">the Asia Times called</a> &#8220;warning bells&#8221; in the sector. From there, things went from penalties to punishing regulatory changes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The round comes about a year after Solarisbank's last round of $67.5 million, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that its valuation has nearly quintupled since then.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; the process by which some of the more complicated, but also commoditized, aspects of financial services are built and wrapped in an API for anyone else to implement in their own products for end users &#8212; has become a huge cornerstone of how fintech is built today. Now, one of the earlier and bigger movers in the space is announcing a major round of growth funding to build out its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solarisbank</a>, a Berlin startup that provides a range of financial services by way of some 180 APIs that others use to build end-user-facing products (including basic banking and card services, lending, payments, and know-your-customer services) has raised €190 million ($224 million) in a Series D that values the company at €1.4 billion ($1.65 billion) and announced the acquisition of one of its competitors in the space, <a href="https://www.contis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contis</a>.</p>
<p>Decisive Capital Management, a Swiss firm that has also backed insurtech startup Wefox, led the round, with Pathway Capital Management, CNP (Groupe Frère) and Ilavska Vuillermoz Capital also participating, in addition to and previous backers Yabeo Capital, BBVA, Vulcan Capital and HV Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round comes about a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/banking-platform-solarisbank-raises-67-5-million-at-360-million-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of $67.5 million</a>, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that the company&#8217;s valuation has nearly quintupled since then (it was $360 million in June 2020).</p>
<p>This latest round is going to be used for expansion. CEO Roland Folz said in an interview that the Contis acquisition &#8212; which underscores a wider consolidation trend in fintech &#8212; will help it better cover all of Europe and start to make its first early moves into Asia. There are no plans right now to add the U.S. to that list, he said.</p>
<p>He added that the combined entity will be making revenues in the &#8220;triple-digit euros&#8221; &#8212; that is, hundreds of millions; it posted net revenues of €35 million in 2020 &#8212; and will be in a position to go public next year, if it chooses to.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s hoping to double down on the huge shift we&#8217;re seeing in the world of financial services, where consumers and businesses are opting for newer and more modern banking experiences as they migrate away from slower, less flexible and sometimes more expensive incumbents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe is an ideal space for us to work in,&#8221; said Folz. &#8220;We believe that in Europe there are roughly 800 million bank accounts and some 400 million of those will change &#8216;ownership,&#8217; where traditional banks will be swapped out with non-traditional banks. &#8230; If we look at the five- to 10-year perspective, we want to make sure a significant proportion of those accounts will be on our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>SolarisBank counts Trade Republic, American Express, BP, Samsung and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/vivid-is-a-new-challenger-bank-built-on-top-of-solarisbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivid</a> among its customers, powering basic banking, know-your-customer checks, lending, digital wallet and other services related to finance for companies that can, in turn, focus their energies on building more user-friendly customer experiences or other services altogether. It&#8217;s been growing at a rate of 40%-60% annually, Folz added, and it has some 50 &#8220;partners&#8221; (as it calls its customers) in all, covering some 2 million customer accounts.</p>
<p>Contis, meanwhile, is a substantial business in its own right, with some 200 customers covering more than 2 million users and €9.9 billion in transactions annually.</p>
<p>Solarisbank was founded five years ago out of the Berlin-based startup incubator and investor <a href="https://finleap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finleap</a>, with Ramin Niroumand, a founder of finleap, essentially the &#8220;founder&#8221; of Solarisbank, too. (Currently and more formally, he is also chairman of its advisory board.)</p>
<p>Embedded finance is all the rage at the moment, and a number of startups today are providing fintech-as-a-service or banking-as-a-service tools to third parties. Other notable names in the same segment of the market include Railsbank, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced funding</a> earlier this month;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapyd</a>, which raised a big round at a $2.5 billion valuation earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit</a>, another banking-as-a-service startup picking up funding and growing; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, which really does what its name says (and is also currently raising money); and the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, which ironically is targeting incumbents.</p>
<p>Solarisbank believes its particular approach to this gap in the market gives it more flexibility and mileage: Unlike its rivals, the bulked-up Solarisbank will have banking licenses for Europe and e-money licenses in Lithuania and the U.K., with its tech stack living on AWS, giving it an opportunity to build more services, scale and keep better margins in the process &#8212; a critical detail in what is essentially an economy of scale play.</p>
<p>It also believes that its diverse customer base &#8212; covering not just obvious fintech companies like neobanks, but a variety of others, like Samsung, that are building financial services (in its case, a digital wallet) &#8212; gives it more staying power to cater to whatever segment of that base is growing most at any given time. As Niroumand points out, around 70% of its revenues come from some 30% of its customers. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a diverse clientele we are serving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is currently active in Germany, France, Italy and Spain but says it can cover the whole European Economic Area with passporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the combined entity, we are looking at numbers that no one else is even close to remotely,&#8221; added Folz.</p>
<p>The market opportunity, combined with Solarisbank&#8217;s approach and its current customer base, is what attracted investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are experiencing a paradigm shift in banking, where customers expect financial services to adapt to their specific needs,” Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, a partner at Decisive Capital Management, said in a statement. “Technology is the key to enable this transformation and Solarisbank’s powerful banking-as-a-service platform positions it perfectly for this new banking era. We are both inspired by the team and thrilled to work together on its mission.”</p>

<p>Do you live in a city with shared e-scooters and e-bikes that you never really ride even though you think it&#8217;s a cool concept? Maybe you think paying $10 to go 3 miles is ridiculous, or you don&#8217;t want to touch the sticky handlebars that someone may have previously coughed on. You&#8217;ve considered buying your own, but it ain&#8217;t cheap and you&#8217;re not ready for that kind of commitment &#8230; but wait! From the depths of this stream of consciousness, a new business model emerges: micromobility subscriptions.</p>
<p>The premise is that customers pay a somewhat affordable fee for a monthly rental of a higher-quality e-scooter or e-bike. It&#8217;s delivered to their door and assembled for them. If it breaks down, someone will ship them a new one. And customers can cancel anytime. It&#8217;s truly made for the 21st-century city dweller, adding nicely to their subscriptions of meal kits, vitamins, video streaming, music streaming, book reading, meditation apps, digital trainers and outfits.</p>
<p>Enough about the customer. Investors and companies are seeing the value in either building a business around the micromobility subscriptions model or adding it as another line to an existing business. They say it&#8217;s easy to scale, provides a good return on investment and costs less per mile to operate. And for those who actually care about sustainability, it allows the operator to control the vehicle&#8217;s end of life in a way that sales don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m harping on about this model is because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/why-startups-and-investors-are-turning-to-micromobility-subscriptions/">I wrote about it for ExtraCrunch</a> this week. It&#8217;s behind a paywall, but here are some highlights from the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shawn Carolan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, which invested in e-scooter subscription/sales company Unagi, is bullish on the micromobility subscription model. He says most people would rather pay a low monthly fee rather than a higher upfront fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best customers are repeat customers, commuters or local neighborhood trips,&#8221; Carolan said. &#8220;Repeatedly paying per ride is both expensive and cognitively taxing. People want low friction in transportation. Getting from here to there shouldn&#8217;t require a lot of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures bet that customers would also take better care of high-quality scooter they get to &#8220;own&#8221; for a time, which translates to a longer lifetime for hardware &#8212; something the dockless shared model consistently struggles with. Having an additional route to micromobility will broaden the market, positioning it as a SaaS business, which achieves a higher multiple.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the subscription model? Startups looking to go this route need to work on providing the best possible service in order to retain customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job to be done is reliability,&#8221; Oliver Bruce, angel investor and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast with Horace Dediu, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Maintenance and repairs is still a nascent sector, but for people who want to have a reliable option for travel and don&#8217;t know or care about how to maintain their brakes or gears, it&#8217;s a really good option. Proper servicing will open up micromobility to a far wider group, especially when paired to safe infrastructure and favorable transport policies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Ireland gets on the e-scooter bandwagon</b></h3>
<p>In other news, this week <strong>Ireland</strong> launched its first e-scooter trial across five campuses of Dublin City University. Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> will work with Irish and DCU-based<strong> Luna</strong> to equip e-scooters with computer vision tech that will be able to detect pavement lines and pedestrians. This is similar to what <strong>Drover</strong> is doing with <strong>Spin</strong>, which has just launched its visually updated scooters in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics and Smart DCU, a district of Smart Dublin, will also collaborate on the pilot research. E-scooters are still illegal to ride on Irish roads, but there is <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/e-scooter-laws-ireland-what-20671464">proposed legislation</a> in the works to change that.</p>
<h3>Superpedestrian&#8217;s scooters are not backing vision</h3>
<p>E-scooter company <strong>Superpedestrian</strong> acquired <strong>Navmatic</strong>, a startup that helps micromobility operators locate vehicles and correct their movements in real-time. With access to Navmatic&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">super fusion tech</a>, Superpedestrian has created an advanced safety system called Pedestrian Defense that can detect unsafe riding behaviors and stop them in real-time.</p>
<p>Navmatic&#8217;s technology basically allows the scooter to detect the rider&#8217;s micro-movements. Through those, plus other data picked up from sensors, it can determine things like if the scooter is going the wrong way on a one-way street or riding on the pavement.</p>
<h3>Bike stuff</h3>
<p>The Rad Power RadRover 6 Plus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">launched this week</a>, the latest model of the company&#8217;s flagship bike.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the e-bike for people who come to the world of biking from a car-centric background somewhat reluctantly, but get hooked to the smooth, sturdy ride, user-friendly design and really affordable price. This totally rad bike is only $1,999, and it&#8217;s built to last.</p>
<p>I talked to the bike manufacturer&#8217;s chief product officer, Redwood Stephens, and he explained how Rad Power&#8217;s business model is all about reducing friction for the customer, from the way you order your vehicle to the packaging it arrives in to the big obvious ON button. And this method appears to be going quite well for the company. In February it raised $150 million in funding, probably the most any e-bike company in America has ever raised.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> scored another $2.5 billion in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">private funding round of returning investors</a>. The round was led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised an eye-popping $10.5 billion to date. The company didn&#8217;t share a post-money valuation, but earlier this year when it had announced a $2.65 billion raise TechCrunch learned that its valuation was $27.6 billion.</p>
<p>As the money comes in, the pressure is increasing for the company to deliver its consumer and commercial products. Rivian recently delayed deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The company also confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>.</p>
<p>My other &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; involves a deal that almost wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m speaking of <strong>Lucid Motors of</strong> course, which had to extend the deadline to approve its merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. (They were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">approve the merger on Friday</a>).</p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger &#8212; proposal two, which would revise the company&#8217;s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others &#8212; and it must be approved for the merger to take place &#8212; so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process. The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ChargePoint</strong> acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">European charging software company <strong>has·to·be</strong></a> for €250 million ($295 million) in cash and stock, the electric vehicle charging network&#8217;s first acquisition since it became a publicly traded company. Through the deal, ChargePoint gains more than just 125 employees and the company&#8217;s operating software, which manages more than 40,000 networked ports in Europe. The acquisition will give ChargePoint a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America, as well as VW Group as a strategic partner.</p>
<p><strong>Magna International</strong>, the Canadian auto parts maker, is going to <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/magna-international-buy-veoneer-38b?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">acquire its rival Veoneer</a>, which had spun off from safety equipment supplier Autoliv in 2018, for about $3.8 billion in cash, Automotive News reported. (This also qualifies for my &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221;) The acquisition is going to give Magna a major boost, particularly in the area of driver assistance technologies business.</p>
<p>Magna will buy out Veoneer&#8217;s outstanding shares for $31.25 each, and the acquisition represents an enterprise value of $3.3 billion including debt, the companies said in a joint statement. Magna also said it will capture about $100 million in annual cost savings by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, a universal rewards platform and app that allows anyone with a smartphone to earn miles for all of their travel, raised $12.5 million in Series A funding round led by Scrum Ventures, with participation from TransLink Capital and Japan Airlines (JAL Innovation Fund), TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance (MS&amp;AD), Synapse Partners and several other prominent individual investors. The raise brings Miles&#8217; total funding to $20 million, with other notable investors including JetBlue Technology Ventures, Liil Ventures, Porsche Ventures, Panasonic, SAIC, Sony Innovation Fund, Urban Us (VC), and Gabe Klein (Co-founder CityFi).</p>
<p><strong>Rodo</strong>, an e-commerce startup focused on buying and selling vehicles, raised $18 million in a Series B financing round led by Holman Enterprises and Evolution VC Partners. The round also included existing investor IAC along with Kevin Hart&#8217;s HartBeat Ventures as well as auto industry veterans RML Automotive vice chairman Mack McLarty, McLarty Diversified Holdings Chairman and CEO Franklin McLarty, and Ken Schnitzer, the former chairman of Park Place Automotive Group. Rodo, which has raised a total of $45 million to date, plans to use the funds to scale its dealership network nationwide and invest in marketing and customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Sonatus</strong>, the California-grown automotive software company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/"> raised $35 million in a Series A round</a> that attracted high-profile technology and automotive industry companies including Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s Kia Corporation, SAIC Capital and LG Electronics. Silicon Valley VC Translink Capital led the round, with other investors including Marvell Technology, UMC Capital and Wanxiang Group Company.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">secure nickel</a> from the commodity production giant BHP. The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of mineral that will be supplied, just that it will come from BHP&#8217;s Nickel West division mines in Western Australia. The two companies also agreed to work together to increase battery supply chain sustainability and to identify ways to decrease carbon emissions from their respective operations using energy storage paired with renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Uber Freight</strong>, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, acquired TransPlace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">for $2.25 billion</a> from private equity group TPG Capital. It&#8217;s one of those upstream-meets-downstream type of deals. The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p>
<p>This deal marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner!</p>
<p>EV rebates and tax credits are a well-known incentive mechanism to encourage Americans to make the switch to electric, but people looking for micromobility incentives have historically been out of luck. A new bill introduced in the Senate is looking to change that. The <strong>Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</strong> would give consumers a refundable 30% tax credit on the purchase of an electric bicycle, up to $1,500.</p>
<p>Qualifying bikes must be under $8,000 and reach a max speed of no more than 28 miles per hour. So that means a huge swath of the market would be eligible for the credit. A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1019/text?r=1&amp;s=1">sister bill</a> was introduced to the House earlier this year. If it passes in both parts of Congress, it would then head to President Joe Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/blogs/the-scenic-route/an-inside-look-at-the-ebike-act">interesting interview</a> with <strong>Rep. Earl Blumenauer</strong>, one of the legislators who introduced the bill in the House. (Just a note, it was conducted by The Scenic Route, a vertical of e-bike seller <strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>.) The congressman talks about how e-bike incentives could fit into the larger goals of the massive infrastructure bill currently being mulled by lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking to the Secretary of Transportation yesterday about the opportunities we have with this big infrastructure package and this is one of those elements that ties in with what we&#8217;re doing with the tax system,&#8221; Blumenauer said. &#8220;It reduces traffic congestion, there&#8217;s less pollution to contend with, and it eases the problem of parking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Austin, where the hills have dissuaded me from cycling around &#8212; yet, the majority of my car trips are less than 4 miles. I&#8217;ve often thought that an electric bike would be a good way to use my car less. I&#8217;m sure many other Americans feel similarly.</p>

<p>As per usual, there is a lot to get to this week. When will the news cycle slow down?</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> and its backer and customer Ford had the big AV story of the week. The two companies announced plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. I get deep into the details in the story, but the tl;dr includes Lyft taking a 2.5% stake in Argo, which now has a valuation of $12.4 billion.</p>
<p>The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year. Austin will follow next year, with the remaining U.S. cities being added to the Lyft app in 2023 and beyond. Argo currently tests in Detroit, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Jody Kelman, who heads up Lyft&#8217;s Autonomous, the company&#8217;s self-driving deployment business unit, answers the why we should care question: &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest deployment certainly that we&#8217;re doing and that I think anyone else is doing. One thousand cars across six markets is a big leap forward in terms of scaled commercialization.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">to New York City</a> as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology. If you&#8217;re not watching Mobileye, you should be — even those who don&#8217;t agree with the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>New York City joins a number of other cities, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo, where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> is expanding into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/waymo-to-open-offices-in-pittsburgh-an-av-tech-hub/">AV hub Pittsburgh</a>. The company will start by hiring around a dozen engineers, a source familiar with the move told TechCrunch, and they&#8217;ll co-locate in Google&#8217;s existing offices in the Bakery Square district. As of Thursday, only around three open positions for the Pittsburgh area were listed on Waymo&#8217;s website, but the company will be adding more roles soon.</p>
<p>Notably, some of the new team will come from Pittsburgh-based RobotWits, a tech startup focused on autonomous vehicle decision-making. Waymo acquired RobotWits&#8217; IP rights, and some members of its engineering and technical teams, as well as the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Maxim Likhachev, are joining Waymo.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, the commercial electric vehicle company, has been chosen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">build electric buses</a> for the City of Anaheim, California. The Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant in 2019. The city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Battery joint ventures</strong> have become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">hot must-have deal</a> for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan digs into what is driving this trend and provides a roundup of the latest deals.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> said it will add a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-a-third-electric-pickup-truck-is-in-development/">full-size electric pickup truck</a> to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. GM didn&#8217;t provide much more, but we can expect it to follow the GMC Hummer EV pickup that is coming late this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</strong> said the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-tesla-to-open-up-global-charging-network-to-other-evs-later-this-year/">will allow other electric vehicles</a> to access its global network of chargers later this year. Musk has been chattering about this idea for years now; what made me take it a skosh more seriously is that he attached a timeline to this. My prediction is that Tesla owners will push back.</p>
<p>Speaking of Musk, the technoking said the automaker will &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-most-likely-accept-bitcoin-again-when-it-becomes-more-eco-friendly/">most likely&#8221; resume accepting bitcoin</a> as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables. He made the comments at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation. You might recall that Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin &#8212; before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> laid out a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">an electric-only automaker</a> by the end of the decade. To be clear, Mercedes did give itself some wiggle room in that ambitious goal, noting that it will be &#8220;ready to go all-electric by the end of the decade, where markets allow.&#8221; This could mean that some combustion-engine Mercedes, which are already equipped with 48-volt mild hybrid systems, will be produced and sold beyond the decade.</p>
<p>This target is driving Mercedes to become more vertically integrated, secure its supply chain and retrain its workforce. For instance, the automaker noted that it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">acquired U.K.-based electric motor company YASA and determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</span></p>
<h2>In-car tech and ADAS</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is rolling out three major upgrades, including automatic lane changes and towing support, to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">hands-free driver assistance system</a> Super Cruise. It will be available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>Speaking of Super Cruise, GM isn&#8217;t OK with <strong>Ford</strong> naming its own ADAS BlueCruise. GM and its self-driving vehicle subsidiary Cruise <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/564670-gm-files-trademark-lawsuit-against-ford">filed a lawsuit against Ford</a> claiming that the BlueCruise name is too similar to its Super Cruise trademark and Cruise&#8217;s trademark, The Hill reported.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing, car-sharing and other stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong> was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/peer-to-peer-car-rental-startup-getaround-fined-nearly-1m-by-dcs-attorney-general/">fined nearly $1 million</a> by the Washington, D.C., Office of the Attorney General for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls &#8220;politically motivated allegations.&#8221;</p>
