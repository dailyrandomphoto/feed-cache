										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is backing hydrogen as a top energy solution for sustainability. With its new fuel cell system that it plans to launch in the next few years, the South Korean automaker said it will provide hydrogen fuel cell versions for all its commercial vehicles by 2028.</p>
<p>Hyundai announced its strategy for the future of hydrogen on Tuesday during a live stream of the automaker&#8217;s Hydrogen Wave conference. Saehoon Kim, executive vice president and head of the fuel cell center at Hyundai Motor Group, said Hyundai&#8217;s goal is to also achieve cost competitiveness comparable to that of EV batteries by 2030.</p>
<p>The company also shared details about its high-performance, rear-wheel drive hydrogen sports car, the Vision FK, with a 500kW fuel cell system that can push it from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under four seconds and has 600 kilometers (373 miles) of range. Hyundai did not share when the vehicle would go into production.</p>
<p>As most automakers begin to roll out electric vehicles for both passenger and commercial use, hydrogen is still a bit of a niche market, but one that is growing as Europe, China and the United States set ambitious emissions reductions goals. Toyota Motor Corp, BMW and Daimler have all begun embracing hydrogen fuel cell technology to varying degree, even as they continue to develop exclusively electric vehicles. For its part, Hyundai&#8217;s commitment to hydrogen doesn&#8217;t deter from its commitment to electric. With the climate situation as it is, we&#8217;re facing an all hands on deck situation. May the best fuel win.</p>
<p>At the event, Kim also announced Hyundai&#8217;s plans to launch two new hydrogen fuel cell powertrains in 2023, which the company hopes will help make hydrogen mainstream by 2040. The third generation of Hyundai&#8217;s hydrogen fuel stack will come in either 100 kW or 200kW outputs for either passenger cars or commercial vehicles, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai, Kia and Genesis, has one fuel cell bus on the market today, the Elec City Fuel Cell bus, with 115 buses live on the road in South Korea. The automaker also has one fuel cell truck, the Xcient Hyundai, on the market, 45 of which were launched in Switzerland last year.</span></p>
<p>Hyundai boasts a fuel-cell SUV, the NEXO, with plans to introduce the next model in 2023, alongside a hydrogen-powered multi-purpose vehicle model. The company announced at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich that it would also launch a large fuel cell-powered SUV after 2025, as well as four more commercial vehicles by the end of the decade. The company aims to provide fuel cell technology for different use cases, including emergency vehicles, ships, freights, trams, forklifts and other vehicles for industrial processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fuel cell is a proven technology that can deliver the benefits of hydrogen to people around the world in various fields,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;Basically, a fuel cell is a power generator like an engine. It differs from a battery which stores electricity. A fuel cell system consists of a fuel cell stack that generates electricity, a hydrogen supply system, an air supply system and a thermal management system. It generates power by combining hydrogen and oxygen, similar to the engine of an internal combustion vehicle, but without the carbon emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim went onto explain that fuel cell systems produce energy through chemical reactions and operate as long as hydrogen fuel is supplied, unlike a battery which just passively stores energy. He said Hyundai is working on building up the necessary ecosystem to create success in the hydrogen space, including production, storage, fuel cell technology and infrastructure. Much of the infrastructure would be solar and wind sources that would produce the renewable energy needed to create clean power to split water into oxygen and &#8216;green&#8217; hydrogen.</p>
<p>Alongside its own research and development, Hyundai Motor has also already invested in hydrogen startups like H2Pro and has announced plans to establish green hydrogen infrastructures in countries with supportive governments and abundant renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>Much of the movement in this space comes after the group announced its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2045 and to reduce its emissions by 75% below 2019 levels by 2040. By 2030, Hyundai expects 30% of all vehicle sales to be zero emission, with battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles taking up 80% of total fleet sales by 2040.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francophone Africa has its first unicorn, and if you&#8217;ve been following tech on the continent, you will be very unsurprised to hear that it&#8217;s coming from the world of fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.wave.com/en/">Wave</a>, a U.S. and Senegal-based mobile money provider, has raised $200 million in Series A round of funding. The investment is the largest-ever Series A round for the region, and it values Wave at $1.7 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four big-name backers jointly led the round &#8212; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and a subsidiary of Sequoia; Founders Fund; payments upstart Stripe; and Ribbit Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others in the round include existing investor Partech Africa and Sam Altman, the former CEO of Y Combinator and current CEO of OpenAI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobile money market in sub-Saharan Africa is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This past year, up to $500 billion has moved through the accounts of 300 million active mobile money users in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite being one of the largest alternative financial infrastructures known globally, this represents only a fraction of the overall market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Monetary Fund says that as of 2017, only 43% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa were &#8220;banked&#8221; by way of a traditional bank or mobile money account. When it comes to growing that proportion, however, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obile money &#8212; based on simpler technology and with an easier onboarding process &#8212; wins out, and it is set to capture more market share faster than traditional banking in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And this has investors, especially foreign ones, excited and looking to get on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Neobanking, based on mobile technology too, falls somewhere in the middle of the two).</span></p>
<h2>From Sendwave to Wave</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re wondering why you haven&#8217;t heard of Wave, the reason might be because you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a spinoff from Africa-focused remittance provider Sendwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk founded Sendwave in 2014 to offer little or no fee remittances from North America and Europe to select African and Asian countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The YC-backed company became a WorldRemit subsidiary last year when the global fintech paid up to $500 million in cash and stock for Sendwave.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198507" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198507" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Wave" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg 5479w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198507" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, the team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealthily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked on a mobile money product described as having no account fees and &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available and accepted everywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the product was piloted as Wave in Senegal but it was still within the Sendwave ecosystem. When WorldRemit acquired Sendwave, Durbin and his team turned their focus to Wave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw an opportunity to make a bigger impact by trying to build a better, much more affordable mobile money service than the telcos are building throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; Durbin told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see any companies besides the telcos trying to solve that problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Going up against incumbents</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecom operators and banks have been the early entrants in the mobile money space, not least because they control much of the infrastructure in the process, from having mobile subscribers using handsets on their networks through to building the financial services to manage money and payments at the back end, and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party providers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintechs, have tried to capture some market share from these incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wave, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wants to disrupt it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin tells TechCrunch that unlike M-Pesa, the mobile payment provider led by Safaricom, and other products of telecom operators like Orange and Tigo, Wave is building a mobile money service that is &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dakar-based platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts) runs an agent network that uses their cash on hand to service Wave users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, users can make free deposits and withdrawals and charge a 1% fee whenever they send money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin says this is 70% cheaper than telecom-led mobile money and whenever there is a transfer problem, refunds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlike with incumbents where users might need to wait for some days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave&#8217;s technology also differs from telecom-led mobile money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas the incumbents mostly focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on USSD (although there are provisions to use applications), Wave is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For users without a smartphone, Wave also provides a free QR-card to transact with an agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By building its own infrastructure full-stack &#8212; agent network, agent and consumer applications, QR cards, business collections, and disbursements &#8212; Wave has been able to fuel its growth to several million monthly active users and billions of dollars in annual volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198492" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198492" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?w=680" alt="Wave" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg 8688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wave</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year-old startup claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal and that over half of the country&#8217;s adults are active users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pegs the number of users between 4 million and 5 million, and Wave wants to replicate this growth in Ivory Coast, the second market it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded to last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of growth pressure on telecom operators. That has indeed been the case for the leading telecom operator in both regions, Orange. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">June, the telecom operator stopped users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave&#8217;s mobile application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">report</a>, Wave argued that Orange was applying anti-competitive tactics by restricting it from selling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via an approved wholesaler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Orange said it had made proposals &#8220;in line with those offered to its other providers&#8221; and that Wave wanted special treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach a fair decision, both parties are working with the regulatory body in charge, Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts (RATP)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if the regulator isn&#8217;t capable of settling the issue, BCEAO, the regional bank of Francophone countries, is the next in line to resolve the dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wave&#8217;s CEO, the bank&#8217;s regulatory approach is one reason why Wave has been able to take on the telecom operators in the first place. But among all the West African countries where mobile money is prevalent, why start with Senegal, an emerging market?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senegal is a big enough market that we would have to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> win the market. But also a small enough market that if we were doing well, we could win the market quicker than if we were in a giant country. And so that combination of those two things made it seem like a good place to start,&#8221; Durbin remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this fundraise, Wave will deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast and grow its already 800-strong team across product, engineering, and business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wave will expand into other markets it feels are regulatory-friendly like Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a pretty broad array of countries that have strong central banks and clear regulations are open to new players, or even want new players to come in and try to compete with the telcos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we have a lot of licenses that are in progress, and we&#8217;ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">try to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the countries where we&#8217;re able to get started sooner over the ones that it takes longer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>A unicorn after two rounds</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">reports</a> say Wave had raised $13.8 million prior to this, Durbin declined to comment on the figure when asked. However, he did mention</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Partech, the French outfit with an African fund, invested in a seed round alongside other investors like Founders Fund and Stripe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sequoia and Sam Altman, the same crop of investors also participated in this monster Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a market that has typically lacked innovation, Partech general partner Tidjane Deme says the investment will help Wave improve its service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since 2018, we&#8217;ve supported Wave because we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were convinced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile money is still an unsolved problem in Africa,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Wave has great product design, stellar execution, and a strong financial trajectory. We are proud to see it become the first unicorn from Senegal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Sequoia Capital invested in Egyptian fintech Telda, its first big deal on the continent. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave investment, meanwhile, is coming via subsidiary Sequoia Heritage and is the latter&#8217;s first investment in an Africa-focused startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, Altman said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave ticked the boxes he considers before an investment &#8212; strong founders, an important problem in a large market, working product, and traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve known these founders for a long time, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they&#8217;re like off the charts good. I&#8217;ve been super impressed with their ability to figure out what users want and how to grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company is solving the most important problem around money transfer in Africa and fixing the inefficient agent networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest venture rounds for any venture in Africa remain OPay&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">$400 million fundraise</a> and Jumia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/03/rocket-internets-africa-internet-group-raises-326m-from-goldman-sachs-and-others/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both were Series C rounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next biggest rounds include Interswitch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">$200 million investment</a> from Visa and Flutterwave&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">$170 million Series C</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies attained unicorn status following their respective rounds. The same goes for Wave but more spectacularly, considering the company bagged it in a Series A round, it&#8217;s transcending the region and is one of the largest A-rounds globally this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave joins OPay and Flutterwave as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minted unicorns in Africa this year &#8212; that is, startups valued above $1 billion &#8212; and the fourth African unicorn after Interswitch. Other billion-dollar companies include publicly traded Jumia and Egyptian fintech Fawry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding rounds in Africa keep getting bigger and the continent has reached an inflection point. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some skeptics have questioned the valuations of previous unicorns; Wave wouldn&#8217;t be an exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument would be around why Wave commands such a high valuation when for instance, two prominent telecom operators, Airtel and MTN, are looking to list their mobile money businesses between $2 to $6 billion despite being in the operations for several years across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet like any investor optimistic about a portfolio company, Altman doesn&#8217;t believe Wave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is overvalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, he thinks the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is undervalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity in front of the company is massive. But plenty of times, I&#8217;ve gotten it wrong, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you never know. However, I have been fortunate to make </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great investments and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave has as good of a shot as you can ask for,&#8221; he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Africa is going to be the fastest growing and most important market over the next coming decades for many companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people are realizing how big the market opportunity is and how much value is going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we&#8217;ll see a lot more things like this happen.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BP Ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant BP, has announced a €10 million (~$11.9 million) investment in Ryd, a German in-car digital payments provider. The fresh funds will help Ryd expand its service into international markets and build out its offering, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Ryd&#8217;s service allows users to lump together online payments for services like fuel purchases, EV charging and car washing via the startup&#8217;s app or integration with smart car systems. BP already offers digital payment options in the UK and the Netherlands through its BPme app. As part of its investment and partnership with Ryd, the legacy company hopes to expand its digital offerings as it learns from the startup&#8217;s secure and flexible digital payment options. Ryd will get the benefit of scaling its technology to BP customers across Europe.</p>
<p>“In-car digital payments are an integral part of the seamless and convenient experience that customers increasingly expect at our retail sites,&#8221; Alex Jensen, bp’s senior vice president mobility and convenience, Europe and Southern Africa, said in a statement. &#8220;Ryd’s technology can help deliver just that, and for an increasing range of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first bet BP is taking in the smart vehicle space, and it likely won&#8217;t be the last. In June,<a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-ventures/news/press-releases/bp-makes-seven-million-dollar-investment-in-electric-vehicle-charging-firm-iotecha.html"> the firm also invested $7 million in IoTecha</a>, a smart EV charging company that connects chargers with the electricity grid using IoT and automates charging payments. Strategic investments like these ultimately add to<a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-strategy-update-2018-lamar-mckay-presentation.pdf"> BP Ventures&#8217;s ecosystem</a> which is designed to help BP reinvent itself as an integrated energy company, as well as help it reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Ryd is already accepted today at 3,000 partner service stations across seven countries, according to the company. It has 1.4 million direct customers, as well as access to up to 100 million additional customers through its partnerships with Mastercard and several car manufacturers. With the connected car data market expected to reach $19 billion globally by 2030, and the non-fuel retail sales market expected to reach <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ie/pdf/2020/06/fuel-forecourt-retail-market.pdf">$285 billion globally by the same year,</a> the startup is now homing in on its strategy to integrate its tech into more vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Ryd we want to enable hassle-free and secure interactions with cars,&#8221; said Oliver Goetz, founder and chairman of Ryd, in a statement. &#8220;BP is the final piece to our puzzle and completes our ecosystem with strong strategic partners in all of our business areas: finance, automotive and energy. BP expects tens of millions of car drivers to move to direct digital payment systems, which are both connected to car data and to payment systems at gas stations and beyond. This new payment form is much faster, easier and more comfortable. Ryd is on its way to lead this movement in Europe.”</p>
<p>Ryd expects to go live at the first BP filling stations in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Ryd&#8217;s CEO Sandra Dax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber is in advanced stages of talks to raise a new financing round at up to $2 billion in valuation, several sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If the talks materialize in a deal, CoinSwitch Kuber will become the second crypto startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The four-year-old startup, which counts Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, and Ribbit Capital among its existing investors, was valued at over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">$500 million valuation in its Series B</a> financing round in April this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear who is positioning to lead the round. The firm has engaged closely with Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase in recent weeks, several people aware of those discussions told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A deal may finalize within this month, sources said. The size of the deal, according to one source, is over $100 million. Usual caveats apply: terms of the proposed deal may change or the talks may not result in a deal.</p>
<p>The startup declined to comment. Coinbase and A16z, which has yet to back any Indian startup, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India did not respond to a request for comment last week.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when CoinSwitch Kuber has almost doubled its userbase in recent months &#8212; even as local authorities push back against crypto assets. Its eponymous app had over 7 million monthly active users in India last month, up from about 4 million in April this year, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (data of which an industry exec shared with TechCrunch).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>B Capital backed CoinDCX, a rival of CoinSwitch Kuber that has amassed 3.5 million users, last month in a $90 million round that valued CoinDCX at about $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Policymakers in India have been debating on the status of digital currencies in the South Asian market for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">several years</a>. India&#8217;s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, has expressed concerns about private virtual currencies though it is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/india-considering-phased-roll-out-of-central-bank-digital-currency/">run trial programs of its first digital currency</a> as soon as December.</p>
<p>More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge, have increased the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. TechCrunch reported last week that Tiger Global is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">engaging with Apna</a> to fund a new round that values the 21-month-old Indian firm at over $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial services, especially those for people who don’t have access to traditional bank accounts or lines of credit, <a href="https://finovate.com/southeast-asias-fintech-boom-all-you-need-to-know/">are proliferating in Southeast Asia</a>. Jeff App wants to give consumers a “super app” where they can compare many financial products and apply for them using the startup’s proprietary data-scoring models. For service providers, Jeff serves as a distribution channel, helping them find and retain customers. The startup announced today it has raised a seed extension of $1.5 million, led by J12 Ventures. Other participants included iSeed Ventures and Toy Ventures, and returning investors EstBAN, Startup Wise Guys and other angels.</p>
<p>The funding brings Jeff’s total raised to about $2.5 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jeff-raises-1m-to-build-alternative-credit-scoring-and-other-fintech-products-for-southeast-asia/">announced a $1 million seed round back in March</a>. Founder and chief executive officer Tom Niparts told TechCrunch that Jeff had a net profitable second quarter and wasn&#8217;t planning on raising again, but investors were interested because of its strong growth since the beginning of the year. The startup claims that since the end of January, its users have tripled to 700,000, who compared a total of four million products over the past six months.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff raises $1M to build alternative credit scoring and other fintech products for Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jeff-raises-1m-to-build-alternative-credit-scoring-and-other-fintech-products-for-southeast-asia/embed/#?secret=BvpGWFHqsS" data-secret="BvpGWFHqsS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded in 2019, the startup is operational in Vietnam and has applied for a license to launch in Indonesia. It also plans to enter the Philippines in the third quarter. Part of the funding will be used to increase Jeff’s team from about 15 people now to more than 40 employees for its offices in Latvia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Before launching Jeff, Niparts was CEO of Spain for Digital Finance International, a fintech company that is part of the Finstar Financial Group. During that time, Niparts saw that in many Southeast Asian countries, people struggled to get loans not because of their credit history or income, but because they simply didn’t have enough personal financial data. Jeff was created to develop alternative data scoring models for financial services.</p>
<p>Niparts said Jeff’s goal is to become a main distribution channel for financial services in Southeast Asia and the top place for consumers to compare products and apply for them.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Jeff enjoyed strong growth during the first half of this year was by honing its user acquisition strategy in Vietnam. At first, it relied on global channels for user acquisition, like Google and Facebook ads, but now its top acquisition channel is through partnering with local affiliates, including bloggers and social media influencers who have grown considerable followings with educational content about finances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What we were surprised about is that in Europe, for instance, TikTok would never work for financial services, but in Vietnam we saw that it is a pretty amazing channel,” said Niparts.</p>
<p>While one of Jeff’s main features is loan comparison, the company has started expanding its offerings because most people only borrow money once in a while.</p>
<p>To create incentives to return to Jeff, instead of offloading the app once they secure a loan, Jeff is also offering coupons, like Shopee discounts and planning to launch telecom top-ups with cashback offers and a user referral functionality. It is also working on neobank and mobile wallet comparisons, payment functionalities, installment financing, services for micro-to small-sized merchants and a data science model to increase conversions for providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every startup founder faces the same issue — how do you manage your cap table and equity plans in a transparent and lightweight manner? If you’re based in the U.S., chances are you’re using an equity management solution like <a href="https://carta.com">Carta</a>. But if you’re not based in the U.S., you don’t have a ton of options.</p>
<p><a href="https://ledgy.com">Ledgy</a> wants to become the ownership management tool for the rest of the world. Based in Switzerland, several well-known European startups are already using Ledgy, such as Wefox, Kry, Bitpanda, Gorillas and Trade Republic.</p>
<p>The company recently closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors in the round include Xavier Niel, Harry Stebbings, Visionaries Club, UiPath&#39;s Daniel Dines and Front&#39;s Mathilde Collin. Some of Ledgy’s existing investors also invested once again, such as Myke Näf, Paul Sevinç, btov Partners, Creathor Ventures and VI Partners.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Ledgy co-founder and CEO Yoko Spirig talked with an entrepreneur, the founder showed her how he managed ownership. He opened an Excel spreadsheet and scrolled, scrolled, scrolled… “Each line represented a share. You can imagine how error-prone it is,” she told me.</p>
<p>While the implementation was odd, most companies in Europe are still using Excel spreadsheets to manage ownership. And Ledgy wants to convince those companies that switching to a software solution that has been specifically designed to solve this issue could be beneficial.</p>
<p>“The key has really been to focus on the software infrastructure. What we do is that we have implemented automation workflows that are adaptable depending on countries,” Spirig said. “We’re not focusing on one regulation and we’re really offering the infrastructure layer,” she added.</p>
<p>That’s why Ledgy already supports 32 countries. It has tweaked its product even more specifically for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There will be more country-specific releases in the near future for startups based in the U.K. and France. 1,500 companies are using Ledgy right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you switch to Ledgy, there are three main advantages. First, like other software-as-a-service products, Ledgy acts as a single source of truth for all stakeholders — the HR team, the finance team, investors, lawyers and employees.</p>
<p>The second selling point is that you can automate some of the most tedious tasks. For instance, Ledgy can automatically generate documents based on templates and different variables. Signed documents are stored on Ledgy. You can export data every quarter or every year for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Third, it fosters transparency across the company. Employees can check the value of their options. They can see how much their options could be worth if the leadership team is in the process of raising a new round of funding.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Ledgy plans to expand into new markets. The company also plans to roll out support for public companies so that some of its existing customers can go public and keep using Ledgy.</p>

<p>For many manufacturers and freight forwarders, managing logistics is still a very manual process: tracking shipments with a call or online lookup, and entering that data into an Excel spreadsheet. <a href="https://portcast.io/">Portcast</a>, which describes itself as a “next-generation logistics operating system,” makes the process more efficient by gathering data from myriad sources and not only track shipments in real-time, but also predicts what might affect its progress, like major weather events, the tide and pandemic-related issues.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $3.2 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Newtown Partners, through the Imperial Venture Fund, with participation from Wavemaker Partners, TMV, Innoport and SGInnovate. Based in Singapore, Portcast serves clients in Asia and Europe, and will use part of its funding to expand into more markets.</p>
<p>Co-founders Nidhi Gupta and Dr. Lingxiao Xia met at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/entrepreneur-first-eyes-further-asia-growth/">Entrepreneur First in Singapore</a>. Before launching Portcast, Gupta, its chief executive officer, served in leadership roles across Asia at DHL. During that time, she realized the logistic sector’s “inefficiencies are actually an opportunity in this space to create something.” Dr. Xia, who holds a PhD in machine learning and has a background in product development and cloud computing, “was a great complementary fit” and is now Portcast’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>Portcast says it tracks more than 90% of world trade volume that travels by ocean carriers, and 35% of air cargo, and can forecast demand for 30,000 trade routes. Sources include geospatial data, like satellite data about where ships are, what speed and direction they’re moving in, what ports they are headed for, wind speed and wave height. Portcast also looks at economic patterns (for example, Brexit’s impact on ports around the United Kingdom, and how vaccine rollouts around the world changes airline and ship capacity), weather events like typhoon and disruptions like the Suez Canal blockage.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 tips for establishing your startup&#8217;s global supply chain&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/6-tips-for-establishing-your-startups-global-supply-chain/embed/#?secret=NV4h37GRWc" data-secret="NV4h37GRWc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other data sources include proprietary transactional data from customers including large shipping companies and freight forwarders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The challenge for us is how do we let all of this data speak the same language,” Gupta told TechCrunch. “This data is coming in at different frequencies, different granularities, so how do you consolidate that and make sure the machine can start understanding it and interpreting it.”</p>
<p>Portcast’s two main solutions are currentlu Intelligent Container Visibility for real-time tracking of shipment containers, and Forecasting and Demand Management, which tracks booking patterns. Portcast doesn’t use IoT to track containers since it is cost-prohibitive to place a device in every one, but is working with IoT providers on hybrid solutions—for example, putting a tracking device in one container and then using that data to help manage the rest of the shipment.</p>
<p>The startup’s goal is to make predictions that help companies improve the efficiency of their operations, and reduce their reliance on manual processes. “There are logistics operators with hundreds of cargo coming in every single week, they’re going and checking this manually every day. That goes into an Excel sheet and that’s what the planning of downstream operations is based off of,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic created an “urgent need to digitize, and it’s transformed supply chains from being a cost function to the core of getting products on time, so we work with some of the largest manufacturers as well as freight forwarders,” she added. For example, a food and beverage company in Europe sent a shipment to Taipei, a trip that usually takes about 70 days. But it took more than three months to arrive. Portcast was able to track the shipment as it moved across different ports and ships, helping its customers understand what caused the delay.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“Besides just predicting when there will be a likely disruption, we’re able to pinpoint and say there’s a delay of X days because there will likely be a typhoon or a transshipment, and that empowers them because they can tell their trucking and warehousing teams how many containers are going to come in,” said Gupta. “This reduces port fees, detention charges and the number of hours spent on manually checking different company’s websites and trying to figure out what happened to their supply chain.”</span></p>
<p>One of Portcast’s advantages over other logistics tech startups that want to fix supply chain visibility is that it launched out of the Asia-Pacific region, where ships usually go through multiple ports and have to work around frequent weather events like tropical storms and typhoons. The technology Portcast developed to create shorter voyages between Singapore and Malaysia (for example) is also applicable to intercontinental routes like Asia and Europe, or Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>“Our technology is global in scale and that allows us to compete against other players in this market,” said Gupta. “The other thing that differentiates us is that we work not just with manufacturers, but also with shipping companies, logistics companies and cargo airlines, and that allows us to create network effects. There is a really strong synergy between what’s happening in ocean freight and air freight, and that allows us to understand patterns in the industry and creates leverage for any other company that comes onto our platform.</p>
<p>Portcast’s future plans include moving from predictive AI to include prescriptive AI within the next two quarters. Right now, the platform can tell companies what is causing delays, but prescriptive AI will also enable it to make automated suggestions. For example, it can tell clients what ports are faster, other ships and modes of transport that can help them get around a disruption and how to optimize their capacity.</p>
<p>The company is also planning to launch Order Visiblity by the end of this year, a feature that will track containers filled with a specific item. Consumer prices for many different kinds of products are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/consumer-prices-rising-cpi-heres-whats-increasing-the-most-and-why/">rising, due in part to overwhelmed supply chains</a>. By enabling companies to track specific SKUs in real-time, Portcast can not only help items arrive more quickly, but also show how much CO2 emissions each shipment creates.</p>
<p>“Carbon offsetting or carbon trading can only happen once you have visibility into how much you are actually spending, and that’s the piece we can get involved in,” said Gupta. “By allowing predictions like, for example, if you will arrive early, that’s an opportunity for a shipping company to slow down and save fuel like bunker fuel, which not only brings an immense amount of savings, but also reduces CO2 emissions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest quasi-throwback toward &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">do not track</a>&#8216;, the UK&#8217;s data protection chief has come out in favor of a browser- and/or device-level setting to allow Internet users to set &#8220;lasting&#8221; cookie preferences &#8212; suggesting this as a fix for the barrage of consent pop-ups that continues to infest websites in the region.</p>
<p>European web users digesting this development in an otherwise monotonously unchanging regulatory saga, should be forgiven &#8212; not only for any sense of déjà vu they may experience &#8212; but also for wondering if they haven&#8217;t been mocked/gaslit quite enough already where cookie consent is concerned.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last month, UK digital minister Oliver Dowden took aim at what he dubbed an &#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/08/25/oliver-dowden-creating-data-laws-one-biggest-prizes-brexit/">endless</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8221; parade of cookie pop-ups &#8212; suggesting the government is eyeing watering down consent requirements around web tracking as ministers consider how to diverge from European Union data protection standards, post-Brexit. (He&#8217;</span>s slated to present the full sweep of the government&#8217;s data &#8216;reform&#8217; plans later this month so watch this space.)</p>
<p>Today the UK&#8217;s outgoing information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, stepped into the fray to urge her counterparts in G7 countries to knock heads together and coalesce around the idea of letting web users express generic privacy preferences at the browser/app/device level, rather than having to do it through pop-ups every time they visit a website.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/09/ico-to-call-on-g7-countries-to-tackle-cookie-pop-ups-challenge/">statement</a> announcing &#8220;an idea&#8221; she will present this week during a virtual meeting of fellow G7 data protection and privacy authorities &#8212; less pithily described in the press release as being &#8220;on how to improve the current cookie consent mechanism, making web browsing smoother and more business friendly while better protecting personal data&#8221; &#8212; Denham said: “I often hear people say they are tired of having to engage with so many cookie pop-ups. That fatigue is leading to people giving more personal data than they would like.</p>
<p>“The cookie mechanism is also far from ideal for businesses and other organisations running websites, as it is costly and it can lead to poor user experience. While I expect businesses to comply with current laws, my office is encouraging international collaboration to bring practical solutions in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>“There are nearly two billion websites out there taking account of the world’s privacy preferences. No single country can tackle this issue alone. That is why I am calling on my G7 colleagues to use our convening power. Together we can engage with technology firms and standards organisations to develop a coordinated approach to this challenge,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Contacted for more on this &#8220;idea&#8221;, an ICO spokeswoman reshuffled the words thusly: &#8220;Instead of trying to effect change through nearly 2 billion websites, the idea is that legislators and regulators could shift their attention to the browsers, applications and devices through which users access the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;In place of click-through consent at a website level, users could express lasting, generic privacy preferences through browsers, software applications and device settings – enabling them to set and update preferences at a frequency of their choosing rather than on each website they visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course a browser-baked &#8216;Do not track&#8217; (DNT) signal is not a new idea. It&#8217;s around a decade old at this point. Indeed, it could be called the idea that can&#8217;t die because it&#8217;s never truly lived &#8212; as earlier attempts at embedding user privacy preferences into browser settings were scuppered by lack of industry support.</p>
<p>However the approach Denham is advocating, vis-a-vis &#8220;lasting&#8221; preferences, may in fact be rather different to DNT &#8212; given her call for fellow regulators to engage with the tech industry, and its &#8220;standards organizations&#8221;, and come up with &#8220;practical&#8221; and &#8220;business friendly&#8221; solutions to the regional Internet&#8217;s cookie pop-up problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what consensus &#8212; practical or, er, simply pro-industry &#8212; might result from this call. If anything.</p>
<p>Indeed, today&#8217;s press release may be nothing more than Denham trying to raise her own profile since she&#8217;s on the cusp of stepping out of the information commissioner&#8217;s chair. (Never waste a good international networking opportunity and all that &#8212; her counterparts in the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy are scheduled for a virtual natter today and tomorrow where she implies she&#8217;ll try to engage them with her big idea).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">Her UK replacement, meanwhile, is already lined up</a>. So anything Denham personally champions right now, at the end of her ICO chapter, may have a very brief shelf life &#8212; unless she&#8217;s set to parachute into a comparable role at another G7 caliber data protection authority.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK names John Edwards as its choice for next data protection chief as gov&#8217;t eyes watering down privacy standards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/embed/#?secret=yB4nmCRfiz" data-secret="yB4nmCRfiz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nor is Denham the first person to make a revived pitch for a rethink on cookie consent mechanisms &#8212; even in recent years.</p>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/">October</a>, for example, a US-centric tech-publisher coalition came out with what they called a <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20201007.html">Global Privacy Standard</a> (GPC) &#8212; aiming to build momentum for a browser-level pro-privacy signal to stop the sale of personal data, geared toward California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), though pitched as something that could have wider utility for Internet users.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">By January this year they </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20210128">announced</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 40M+ users were making use of a browser or extension that supports GPC &#8212; along with a clutch of big name publishers signed up to honor it. But it&#8217;s fair to say its global impact so far remains limited. </span></p>
<p>More recently, European privacy group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/europe-needs-to-back-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-consent-nightmares-says-privacy-group/">noyb</a> published a technical proposal for a European-centric automated browser-level signal that would let regional users configure advanced consent choices &#8212; enabling the more granular controls it said would be needed to fully mesh with the EU’s more comprehensive (vs CCPA) legal framework around data protection.</p>
<p>The proposal, for which noyb worked with the Sustainable Computing Lab at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, is called Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC). And noyb has called on the EU to legislate for such a mechanism &#8212; suggesting there&#8217;s a window of opportunity as lawmakers there are also keen to find ways to reduce cookie fatigue (a stated aim for the still-in-train reform of the ePrivacy rules, for example).</p>
<p>So there are some concrete examples of what practical, less fatiguing yet still pro-privacy consent mechanisms might look like to lend a little more color to Denham&#8217;s &#8216;idea&#8217; &#8212; although her remarks today don&#8217;t reference any such existing mechanisms or proposals.</p>
<p>(When we asked the ICO for more details on what she&#8217;s advocating for, its spokeswoman didn&#8217;t cite any specific technical proposals or implementations, historical or contemporary, either, saying only: &#8220;By working together, the G7 data protection authorities could have an outsized impact in stimulating the development of technological solutions to the cookie consent problem.&#8221;)</p>
<p>So Denham&#8217;s call to the G7 does seem rather low on substance vs profile-raising noise.</p>
<p>In any case, the really big elephant in the room here is the lack of enforcement around cookie consent breaches &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">including by the ICO</a>.</p>

<p>Add to that, there&#8217;s the now very pressing question of how exactly the UK will &#8216;reform&#8217; domestic law in this area (post-Brexit) &#8212; which makes the timing of Denham&#8217;s call look, well, interestingly opportune. (And difficult to interpret as anything other than opportunistically opaque at this point.)</p>
<p>The adtech industry will of course be watching developments in the UK with interest &#8212; and would surely be cheering from the rooftops if domestic data protection &#8216;reform&#8217; results in amendments to UK rules that allow the vast majority of websites to avoid having to ask Brits for permission to process their personal data, say by opting them into tracking by default (under the guise of &#8216;fixing&#8217; cookie friction and cookie fatigue for them).</p>
<p>That would certainly be mission accomplished after all these years of cookie-fatigue-generating-cookie-consent-non-compliance by surveillance capitalism&#8217;s industrial data complex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear which way the UK government will jump &#8212; but eyebrows should raise to read the ICO writing today that it expects compliance with (current) UK law when it has so roundly failed to tackle the adtech industry&#8217;s role in cynically sicking up said cookie fatigue by failing to take any action against such systemic breaches.</p>
<p>The bald fact is that the ICO has &#8212; for years &#8212; avoided tackling adtech abuse of data protection, despite acknowledging publicly that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">the sector is wildly out of control</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, it has opted for a cringing &#8216;process of engagement&#8217; (read: appeasement) that has condemned UK Internet users to cookie pop-up hell.</p>
<p>This is why the regulator is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">being sued for inaction</a> &#8212; after it closed a long-standing complaint against the security abuse of people&#8217;s data in real-time bidding ad auctions with nothing to show for it&#8230; So, yes, you can be forgiven for feeling gaslit by Denham&#8217;s call for action on cookie fatigue following the ICO&#8217;s repeat inaction on the causes of cookie fatigue&#8230;</p>

<p>Not that the ICO is alone on that front, however.</p>
<p>There has been a fairly widespread failure by EU regulators to tackle systematic abuse of the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules by the adtech sector &#8212; with a number of complaints (such as this one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">against the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;transparency and consent framework&#8217;</a>) still working, painstakingly, through the various labyrinthine regulatory processes.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s CNIL has probably been the most active in this area &#8212; last year slapping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">Amazon and Google with fines of $42M and $120M </a>for dropping tracking cookies without consent, for example. (And before you accuse CNIL of being &#8216;anti-American&#8217;, it has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/">gone after domestic adtech</a>.)</p>
<p>But elsewhere &#8212; notably Ireland, where many adtech giants are regionally headquartered &#8212; the lack of enforcement against the sector has allowed for cynical, manipulative and/or meaningless consent pop-ups to proliferate as the dysfunctional &#8216;norm&#8217;, while investigations have failed to progress and EU citizens have been forced to become accustomed, not to regulatory closure (or indeed rapture), but to an existentially endless consent experience that&#8217;s now being (re)branded as &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yes, even with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into application in 2018 and beefing up (in theory) consent standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is why the privacy campaign group noyb is now lodging <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">scores of complaints against cookie consent breaches</a> &#8212; to try to force EU regulators to actually enforce the law in this area, even as it also finds time to put up a practical technical proposal that could help shrink cookie fatigue without undermining data protection standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s a shining example of action that has yet to inspire the lion&#8217;s share of the EU&#8217;s actual regulators to act on cookies. The tl;dr is that EU citizens are still waiting for the cookie consent reckoning &#8212; even if there is now a bit of high level talk about the need for &#8216;something to be done&#8217; about all these tedious pop-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The problem is that while GDPR certainly cranked up the legal risk on paper, without proper enforcement it&#8217;s just a paper tiger. And the pushing around of lots of paper is very tedious, clearly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">M</span>ost cookie pop-ups you&#8217;ll see in the EU are thus essentially privacy theatre; at the very least they&#8217;re unnecessarily irritating because they create ongoing friction for web users who must constantly respond to nags for their data (typically to repeatedly try to deny access if they can actually find a &#8216;reject all&#8217; setting).</p>
<p>But &#8212; even worse &#8212; many of these pervasive pop-ups are actively undermining the law (as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/cookie-consent-tools-are-being-used-to-undermine-eu-privacy-rules-study-suggests/">a number of studies</a> have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/10/most-eu-cookie-consent-notices-are-meaningless-or-manipulative-study-finds/"> shown</a>) because the vast majority do not meet the legal standard for consent.</p>
<p>So the cookie consent/fatigue narrative is actually a story of faux compliance <em>enabled</em> by an enforcement vacuum that&#8217;s now also encouraging the watering down of privacy standards as a result of such much unpunished flouting of the law.</p>
<p>There is a lesson here, surely.</p>
<p>&#8216;Faux consent&#8217; pop-ups that you can easily stumble across when surfing the &#8216;ad-supported&#8217; Internet in Europe include those failing to provide users with clear information about how their data will be used; or not offering people a free choice to reject tracking without being penalized (such as with no/limited access to the content they&#8217;re trying to access), or at least giving the impression that accepting is a requirement to access said content (dark pattern!); and/or otherwise manipulating a person&#8217;s choice by making it super simple to accept tracking and far, far, <em>far</em> more tedious to deny.</p>
<p>You can also still sometimes find cookie notices that don&#8217;t offer users any choice at all &#8212; and just pop up to inform that &#8216;by continuing to browse you consent to your data being processed&#8217; &#8212; which, unless the cookies in question are literally essential for provision of the webpage, is basically illegal. (Europe&#8217;s top court made it abundantly clear in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/">2019</a> that active consent is a requirement for non-essential cookies.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court says active consent is needed for tracking cookies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/embed/#?secret=t3gYFHUags" data-secret="t3gYFHUags" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nonetheless, to the untrained eye &#8212; and sadly there are a lot of them where cookie consent notices are concerned &#8212; it can look like it&#8217;s Europe&#8217;s data protection law that&#8217;s the ass because it seemingly demands all these meaningless &#8216;consent&#8217; pop-ups, which just gloss over an ongoing background data grab anyway.</p>
<p>The truth is regulators should have slapped down these manipulative dark patterns years ago.</p>
<p>The problem now is that regulatory failure is encouraging political posturing &#8212; and, in a twisting double-back throw by the ICO! &#8212; regulatory thrusting around the idea that some newfangled mechanism is what&#8217;s really needed to remove all this universally inconvenient &#8216;friction&#8217;.</p>
<p>An idea like noyb&#8217;s ADPC does indeed look very useful in ironing out the widespread operational wrinkles wrapping the EU&#8217;s cookie consent rules. But when it&#8217;s the ICO suggesting a quick fix after the regulatory authority has failed so spectacularly over the long duration of complaints around this issue you&#8217;ll have to forgive us for being sceptical.</p>
<p>In such a context the notion of &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217; looks like it&#8217;s being suspiciously trumped up; fixed on as a convenient scapegoat to rechannel consumer frustration with hated online tracking toward high privacy standards &#8212; and away from the commercial data-pipes that demand all these intrusive, tedious cookie pop-ups in the first place &#8212; whilst neatly aligning with the UK government&#8217;s post-Brexit political priorities on &#8216;data&#8217;.</p>
<p>Worse still: The whole farcical consent pantomime &#8212; which the adtech industry has aggressively engaged in to try to sustain a privacy-hostile business model in spite of beefed up European privacy laws &#8212; could be set to end in genuine tragedy for user rights if standards end up being slashed to appease the law mockers.</p>
<p>The target of regulatory ire and political anger should really be the systematic law-breaking that&#8217;s held back privacy-respecting innovation and non-tracking business models &#8212; by making it harder for businesses that don&#8217;t abuse people&#8217;s data to compete.</p>
<p>Governments and regulators should not be trying to dismantle the principle of consent itself. Yet &#8212; at least in the UK &#8212; that does now look horribly possible.</p>
<p>Laws like GDPR set high standards for consent which &#8212; if they were but robustly enforced &#8212; could lead to reform of highly problematic practices like behavorial advertising combined with the out-of-control scale of programmatic advertising.</p>
<p>Indeed, we should already be seeing privacy-respecting forms of advertising being the norm, not the alternative &#8212; free to scale.</p>
<p>Instead, thanks to widespread inaction against systematic adtech breaches, there has been little incentive for publishers to reform bad practices and end the irritating &#8216;consent charade&#8217; &#8212; which keeps cookie pop-ups mushrooming forth, oftentimes with ridiculously lengthy lists of data-sharing &#8216;partners&#8217; (i.e. if you do actually click through the dark patterns to try to understand what is this claimed &#8216;choice&#8217; you&#8217;re being offered).</p>
<p>As well as being a criminal waste of web users&#8217; time, we now have the prospect of attention-seeking, politically charged regulators deciding that all this &#8216;friction&#8217; justifies giving data-mining giants carte blanche to torch user rights &#8212; if the intention is to fire up the G7 to send a collect invite to the tech industry to come up with &#8220;practical&#8221; alternatives to asking people for their consent to track them &#8212; and all because authorities like the ICO have been too risk averse to actually defend users&#8217; rights in the first place.</p>
<p>Dowden&#8217;s remarks last month suggest the UK government may be preparing to use cookie consent fatigue as convenient cover for watering down domestic data protection standards &#8212; at least if it can get away with the switcheroo.</p>
<p>Nothing in the ICO&#8217;s statement today suggests it would stand in the way of such a move.</p>
<p>Now that the UK is outside the EU, the UK government has said it believes it has an opportunity to deregulate domestic data protection &#8212; although it may find there are legal consequences for domestic businesses if it diverges too far from EU standards.</p>
<p>Denham&#8217;s call to the G7 naturally includes a few EU countries (the biggest economies in the bloc) but by targeting this group she&#8217;s also seeking to engage regulators further afield &#8212; in jurisdictions that currently lack a comprehensive data protection framework. So if the UK moves, cloaked in rhetoric of &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;, to water down its (EU-based) high domestic data protection standards it will be placing downward pressure on international aspirations in this area &#8212; as a counterweight to the EU&#8217;s geopolitical ambitions to drive global standards up to its level.</p>
<p>The risk, then, is a race to the bottom on privacy standards among Western democracies &#8212; at a time when awareness about the importance of online privacy, data protection and information security has actually never been higher.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any UK move to weaken data protection also risks putting pressure on the EU&#8217;s own high standards in this area &#8212; as the regional trajectory would be down not up. And that could, ultimately, give succour to forces inside the EU that lobby against its commitment to a charter of fundamental rights &#8212; by arguing such standards undermine the global competitiveness of European businesses.</p>
<p>So while cookies themselves &#8212; or indeed &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217; &#8212; may seem an irritatingly small concern, the stakes attached to this tug of war around people&#8217;s rights over what can happen to their personal data are very high indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ShopUp, a startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/shopup-raises-22-5-million-to-digitize-millions-of-mom-and-pop-shops-in-bangladesh/">digitizing neighborhood stores in Bangladesh</a>, has raised $75 million in a new financing round that is also the largest in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led <a href="https://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>’s $75 million Series B round. Prosus Ventures as well as existing investors Flourish Ventures, Sequoia Capital India, and VEON Ventures also invested in the round. The new investment, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $100 million, is also Valar&#8217;s and Prosus’ first deals in Bangladesh, home to over 100 million internet users.</p>
<p>Like its neighboring nation, India, more than 95% of all retail in Bangladesh goes through neighborhood stores. There are about 4.5 million such mom-and-pop stores in the country and the vast majority of them have no digital presence.</p>
<p>As is the case in India, Pakistan and several other Asian countries, these small shops face a number of challenges in Bangladesh. They don&#8217;t have access to a large catalog for inventory selection and they can&#8217;t negotiate good pricing and faster delivery. And for these small retailers, more than two-thirds of all their sales are still processed on credit instead of cash or digital payments, creating a massive liquidity crunch.</p>
<p>ShopUp is attempting to address these challenges. It has built what it calls a full-stack business-to-business commerce platform. The startup provides a number of core services to these stores including a wholesale marketplace to secure inventory, logistics (including last-mile delivery to customers) and working capital. (Like many startups in India, ShopUp has banking and other partners to provide working capital.)</p>
<p>In the past year, the startup has expanded its offerings and deepened its footprints within Bangladesh, said Afeef Zaman, co-founder and chief executive of ShopUp​, in an interview with TechCrunch. For instance, it has partnered with country&#8217;s largest manufacturers, producers and distributors to secure and supply inventories to small shops, he said. And its logistics offerings is already the largest in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The startup, like several others, was hit by the pandemic, but as the country begins to open up, ShopUp is beginning to see recovery, he said. Overall, business has grown over 13 times in the last one year, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The leadership team at ShopUp has shown strong execution capabilities over the last twelve months. They became clear market leaders with double digit growth across three products built for the underserved small businesses in Bangladesh. In fast-growing frontier economies like Bangladesh, small businesses are the primary driver of the economy. We are excited to partner with Afeef’s vision of building a connected ecosystem of products to fast-track their transition to the online economy,&#8221; said James Fitzgerald, founding partner of Valar Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Zaman said the past one year has accelerated the adoption of technology among these small shops in Bangladesh. &#8220;They are using several internet-based services now. Not just ShopUp, but also messaging, and virtual payments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We expect this to continue going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dhaka-headquartered startup, which has an office in Bangalore, where the large portion of its tech and engineering talent is based, plans to deploy the fresh funds in part to expand its team. As part of the new round, Zaman said the startup has expanded its employee stock option pool by three times.</p>
<p>“This investment marks our entry into Bangladesh – among the fastest-growing economies in the past decade. ShopUp has demonstrated strong execution focus in solving for a cross-section of needs for small businesses in a fragmented market. We are thrilled to support their efforts to empower millions of retailers and enable them to participate in the country’s economic growth,&#8221; said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for India at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has triggered more demand for contactless and staff-less operations in the hospitality sector, and now <a href="https://www.h2ohospitality.io/">H2O Hospitality</a>, the unmanned hotel management company, has closed a $30 million round on the back of that boost. The South Korea and Japan-based startup automates front and backend processes including accommodation reservation, room management and front desk duties, and it will be using the funds to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p>The Series C round (equivalent to about 34 billion won) is being led by <a href="https://www.kakaoinvestment.com/eng/">Kakao Investment</a> and Korea Development Bank (KDB), Gorilla Private Equity, Intervest and NICE Investment also participated. With Southeast Asia’s joint fund, Kejora-Intervest Growth Fund also joined in the round, it is a sign that H2O Hospitality will be focusing specifically on the Southeast Asian Market. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/japanese-vacation-rental-management-startup-h2o-raises-7-million-series-b-from-investors-including-samsung-ventures/">H2O Hospitality has raised $7 million Series B round from Samsung Ventures, Stonebridge Ventures, IMM Investment and Shinhan Capital in February 2020.</a></p>
<p>H2O Hospitality will expand its business further by adding various types of accommodations in South Korea and Japan in 2021 and 2022 and plans to enter Singapore and Indonesia in 4Q in 2022 in line with its Southeast Asia penetration strategy, according to H2O Hospitality co-founder and CEO John Lee.</p>
<p>“H2O Hospitality is currently speaking with several global hotel chain companies to partner with their digital transformation and operation outside of Korea and Japan,” Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>H2O will invest in R&amp;D to advance its customer channel solutions and contactless check-in systems depending on customer needs of each country in Asia, Lee continued.</p>
<p>“We need optimal system development and customization for each accommodation and situation to lead successful hotel digital transformation even after COVID-19,” Lee said in an email interview.</p>
<p>H2O Hospitality was founded in South Korea 2015 by CEO John Lee, and it has been on something of an acquisition-expansion spree. It entered Japan in 2017, for example, by acquiring several Japanese hospitality management companies. In 2021, H2O acquired two South Korean companies such as the contactless hotel solution company, ImGATE, and a local creator startup, Replace, in order to enhance its technology and ESG competence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These days, the company operates approximately 7,500 accommodations including hotels, ryokans and guest houses, in Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Busan, and Bangkok.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SevenRooms raises $50M to double down on reservations, ordering and other tools for hospitality businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/sevenrooms-raises-50m-to-double-down-on-reservations-ordering-and-other-tools-for-hospitality-businesses/embed/#?secret=cTYjt14NqB" data-secret="cTYjt14NqB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H2O Hospitality’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-based hotel management system, which enables hotel management to automate and digitize, includes the Channel Management System (CMS), Property Management System (PMS), Room Management System (RMS), and Facility Management System (FMS).</p>
<p>Its integrated hotel management system can reduce hotel management’s fixed operating costs by 50%, while increasing revenue by as much as 20%, according to its statement.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 hit the hospitality industry the most and most of the hotels wanted to decrease their fixed cost level, but it was impossible with their current operational flow,” Lee continued, “They had to go through digital transformation”.</p>
<p>When asked how the pandemic affected H2O as COVID-19 still freezes most of the tourism industry, Lee said H2O’s revenue has been increased by as much as 30% before the pandemic, but that percentage has been dropped to 5-15% post COVID-19. Revenue drivers these days are based around tools it&#8217;s built to improve the efficiency of its customers. They include its automated dynamic pricing (ADR) tool and diverse sales channels like online and offline travel agencies in domestic and overseas, he said.</p>
<p>Lee also pointed out that H2O has been onboarding a lot of properties and that has also contributed to H2O&#8217;s revenue growth in the last 18 months. H2O was the only company in Asia, he claims, and many property owners have started to get onboard since August 2020, he explained.</p>
<p>“Every single hotel that we onboarded during the pandemic turned around their profits &amp; losses statements and started to recover their financial loss,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>There are currently about 16.4 million hotel rooms in the world that generate $570 billion a year, according to Lee. H2O believes that it can digitize all the lodging accommodations in the world as the company’s main goal is not building a hotel brand but allowing hotel owners to operate their properties with better operation, he said.</p>
<p>Lee explained that the current hotel operation process looks a lot like that of “2G phones”, that was at a stage before turning to smartphones, and H2O is turning the overall hotel operation into a “smartphone”.</p>
<p>“This is a very natural transition for the (hospitality) industry as it was also natural for the cellphone users to transit from 2G phone to smartphone,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cross-border inbound tourism market has still been stopped for both Korea and Japan even though each domestic market is still pumping demand for the market, Lee mentioned.</p>
<p>“We believe the inbound tourism market will recover within a year as the vaccinations grow for both countries (Korea and Japan),” Lee said.</p>
<p>Managing Director at Kejora-Intervest Growth Fund Jun-seok Kang told TechCrunch: “We knew this new wave for hotel digital transformation trend was coming even before the pandemic; however, COVID-19 definitely expedited the transition period, and we believe H2O will thrive in the transforming hotel market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://a-id.co">A.ID</a>, an identity and compliance platform with a focus on high-risk clients, has closed a pre-seed investment round of $500,000 from angel investors including former employees of RobinHood, Square and Snap.</p>
<p>The startup says it is addressing a market that traditional Fintech companies and banking instutions can’t seem to deal with: namely the rise of apparently ‘risky’ customers who are simply dealing in products deemed problematic. A case in point is that the legal cannabis industry grows by 67% every year, and crypto by over 46%. Meanwhile, the unbanked and underbanked population grows every day, but existing financial institutions seem unable to cater to these exploding markets.</p>
<p>Founded by Ekaterina Romanovskaya, a third-time entrepreneur with experience in both finance and consumer tech, and Justinas Kaminskas, who has launched compliance products in Europe, A.ID is a B2B2C platform.</p>
<p>Romanovskaya said: “Our end-game is to build trust: end-users trust companies with their sensitive data, while companies trust users not to engage in unlawful activity. We strongly believe that this kind of trust is essential, and we see it being eagerly anticipated everywhere.”</p>
<p>A.ID says its solution allows clients to verify their customers’ identities and onboard them, perform standard and enhanced due diligence, screen individuals and businesses against watchlists, monitor their payments, create and solve compliance cases, and report suspicious activities to regulators. The client can integrate it via API (application programming interface) or use it as a web application, or SDK.</p>
<p>So far it counts Arival, a digital bank for emerging industries, and Clos, a social network for creators for user verification.</p>
<p>“I permanently moved to the US in 2017. But I struggled to get the proper attention from VCs: I fell into several categories that were unpopular with venture investors at the same time, such as being a female founder, an immigrant founder, and a founder without technical expertise. The company that I bootstrapped grew organically until the COVID-19 pandemic killed it. I used the 2020 lockdown to study data science and learn to code, and became a data engineer. In September 2020 I founded A.ID,” Romanovskaya told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Romanovskaya became a Twitter celebrity Russia when she co-founded a satirical political account criticizing the Kremlin which had 2M followers at its peak. In 2016 she co-founded Nimb, a fashionable smart ring with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/the-nimb-aims-to-be-a-smart-personal-security-platform-not-just-a-cool-ring/">in-built panic button</a> aimed at women.</p>
<p>A.ID is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, the US. The European branch operates in EU with an office in Lithuania.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial automation platform, <a href="https://aurelia.ltd/">Aurelia</a> has raised $3 million in seed funding, led by Blossom Capital.</p>
<p>Billing itself as a sort of “IFTTT for finance” aimed at small businesses that want to integrate their bank accounts with financial tools, Aurelia says this then gives them greater control over cash flow, taxes etc to automate normally manual tasks, with no knowledge of code needed.</p>
<p>Angel investors include Guillaume Pousaz (Founder &amp; CEO at Checkout.com) through his Zinal Growth investment vehicle and Erez Mathan (ex-COO and CRO at GoCardless).</p>
<p>Aurelia was founded by Sebastian Trif, one of the first engineers at Transferwise and Jasper August Toes.</p>
<p>Trif said: “We see lots of fintech apps and banks that try to capture everything a business has but many small businesses aren’t keen on moving their company’s financial life into a new product.”</p>
<p>Ophelia Brown, founder of Blossom Capital, said: “As a small business owner ourselves, we know first-hand how painful and broken it is for SMEs to manage their finances and accounts. After searching for years for the right solution, we committed to Aurelia on the spot.”</p>
<p>Trif added: “On a feature-by-feature basis, we’re competing with established packs of plugins you must have on top of your accounting software like Xero and Quickbooks. We’re also competing with smart SME banking solutions, such as Tide, Revolut for Business and Wise for Business, which have more limited features.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurelia’s beta platform is now going live in Estonia, Romania, Germany and the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The manufacturing industry took a <a href="https://www.makeuk.org/-/media/files/coronavirus/make-uk-manufacturing-monitor-080221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard hit from the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, but there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Impact_of_Covid-19_crisis_on_industrial_production#Comparison_with_2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs</a> of how it is slowly starting to come back into shape &#8212; helped in part by new efforts to make factories more responsive to the fluctuations in demand that come with the ups and downs of grappling with the shifting economy, virus outbreaks and more. Today, a businesses that is positioning itself as part of that new guard of flexible custom manufacturing &#8212; a startup called <a href="https://fractory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractory</a> &#8212; is announcing a Series A of $9 million (€7.7 million) that underscores the trend.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by <a href="https://www.otb.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">OTB Ventures</span></a>, a leading European investor focussed on early growth, post-product, high-tech start-ups, with existing investors <a href="https://trind.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Trind Ventures</span></a><span class="s3">, <a href="https://superherocapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Superhero Capital</span></a>, <a href="https://unitedangels.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">United Angels VC</span></a>, <a href="https://startupwiseguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Startup Wise Guys</span></a> and <a href="https://www.verve.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Verve Ventures</span></a> also participating</span>.</p>
<p>Founded in Estonia but now based in Manchester, England &#8212; historically a strong hub for manufacturing in the country, and close to Fractory&#8217;s customers &#8212; Fractory has built a platform to make it easier for those that need to get custom metalwork to upload and order it, and for factories to pick up new customers and jobs based on those requests.</p>
<p>Fractory&#8217;s Series A will be used to continue expanding its technology, and to bring more partners into its ecosystem.</p>
<p>To date, the company has worked with more than 24,000 customers and hundreds of manufacturers and metal companies, and altogether it has helped crank out more than 2.5 million metal parts.</p>
<p>To be clear, Fractory isn&#8217;t a manufacturer itself, nor does it have no plans to get involved in that part of the process. Rather, it is in the business of enterprise software, with a marketplace for those who are able to carry out manufacturing jobs &#8212; currently in the area of metalwork &#8212; to engage with companies that need metal parts made for them, using intelligent tools to identify what needs to be made and connecting that potential job to the specialist manufacturers that can make it.</p>
<p>The challenge that Fractory is solving is not unlike that faced in a lot of industries that have variable supply and demand, a lot of fragmentation, and generally an inefficient way of sourcing work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Martin Vares, Fractory&#8217;s founder and MD, described it to me, companies who need metal parts made might have one factory they regularly work with. But if there are any circumstances that might mean that this factory cannot carry out a job, then the customer needs to shop around and find others to do it instead. This can be a time-consuming, and costly process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very fragmented market and there are so many ways to manufacture products, and the connection between those two is complicated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the past, if you wanted to outsource something, it would mean multiple emails to multiple places. But you can&#8217;t go to 30 different suppliers like that individually. We make it into a one-stop shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side, factories are always looking for better ways to fill out their roster of work so there is little downtime &#8212; factories want to avoid having people paid to work with no work coming in, or machinery that is not being used.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average uptime capacity is 50%,&#8221; Vares said of the metalwork plants on Fractory&#8217;s platform (and in the industry in general). &#8220;We have a lot more machines out there than are being used. We really want to solve the issue of leftover capacity and make the market function better and reduce waste. We want to make their factories more efficient and thus sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fractory approach involves customers &#8212; today those customers are typically in construction, or other heavy machinery industries like ship building, aerospace and automotive &#8212; uploading CAD files specifying what they need made. These then get sent out to a network of manufacturers to bid for and take on as jobs &#8212; a little like a freelance marketplace, but for manufacturing jobs. About 30% of those jobs are then fully automated, while the other 70% might include some involvement from Fractory to help advise customers on their approach, including in the quoting of the work, manufacturing, delivery and more. The plan is to build in more technology to improve the proportion that can be automated, Vares said. That would include further investment in RPA, but also computer vision to better understand what a customer is looking to do, and how best to execute it.</p>
<p>Currently Fractory&#8217;s platform can help fill orders for laser cutting and metal folding services, including work like CNC machining, and it&#8217;s next looking at industrial additive 3D printing. It will also be looking at other materials like stonework and chip making.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is one of those industries that has in some ways been very slow to modernize, which in a way is not a huge surprise: equipment is heavy and expensive, and generally the maxim of &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; applies in this world. That&#8217;s why companies that are building more intelligent software to at least run that legacy equipment more efficiently are finding some footing. <a href="https://www.xometry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xometry</a>, a bigger company out of the U.S. that also has built a bridge between manufacturers and companies that need things custom made, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public earlier this year</a> and now has a market cap of over $3 billion. Others in the same space include <a href="https://www.hubs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs</a> (which is now part of Protolabs) and <a href="https://www.qimtek.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qimtek</a>, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">One selling point that Fractory has been pushing is that it generally aims to keep manufacturing local to the customer to reduce the logistics component of the work to reduce carbon emissions, although as the company grows it will be interesting to see how and if it adheres to that commitment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors believe that Fractory&#8217;s approach and fast growth are strong signs that it&#8217;s here to stay and make an impact in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fractory has created an enterprise software platform like no other in the manufacturing setting. Its rapid customer adoption is clear demonstrable feedback of the value that Fractory brings to manufacturing supply chains with technology to automate and digitise an ecosystem poised for innovation,&#8221; said Marcin Hejka in a statement. &#8220;We have invested in a great product and a talented group of software engineers, committed to developing a product and continuing with their formidable track record of rapid international growth</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before you jump into the transportation news of the week, a bit of TechCrunch company news!</p>
<p>Private equity firm <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> completed its acquisition of Yahoo (formerly known as Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath) from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company. The group, aside from Yahoo properties like Mail, Sports and Finance, includes <strong>TechCrunch</strong>, AOL, Engadget and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo&#8217;s figures.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong>: be on the lookout for automotive and tech news coming out of IAA Mobility in Munich this week. A bit of news that broke Sunday included <strong>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles</strong> and autonomous vehicle technology company <strong>Argo AI</strong> unveiling the first version of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving/"> ID Buzz AD</a>. <strong>Mercedes</strong> also had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/mercedes-benz-throws-down-the-ev-gauntlet-at-iaa-mobility/">busy day in the world of EVs</a>.</p>
<p>As always, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>
<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might have noticed that the micromobbin&#8217; section wasn&#8217;t featured in last week&#8217;s newsletter. Well, Rebecca Bellan is making up for that with an extra long write up this week. <em>Take it away Rebecca.</em></p>
<p>Since Auckland, New Zealand is back in a massive lockdown, the highlight of my week has been getting to write about and, and thus relive, my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/ubco-2x2-adventure-bike-review-utility-that-shreds/">test of the electric utility bike</a> built by Kiwi company <strong>Ubco</strong>. If any other electric micro-vehicle companies want to send me a tester and brighten my day, I&#8217;m always open.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: the Ubco bike looks like a dirt bike and rides like a moped and absolutely shreds. Pros: Smooth ride, good battery life and can carry a lot of weight and accessories. Cons: A bit on the pricey side, regenerative brakes think they know what&#8217;s best for me when I&#8217;m speeding downhill and a touchy keyfob.</p>
<h3>Last-mile deliveries</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of those smart lazy people who orders meal kits through the likes of HelloFresh or Blue Apron, you&#8217;ve probably interacted with <strong>AxleHire</strong> without knowing it. That&#8217;s about to change.</p>
<p>The last-mile logistics provider announced this week that it would be expanding two pilot programs to bring cool tech to the delivery scene. Over the past year or so, the company&#8217;s been partnering with URB-E and using its network of collapsible containers strapped onto e-bikes to make deliveries in NYC, as well as Tortoise&#8217;s remotely controlled adorable delivery bots in LA. Now, those programs, which helped AxleHire reduce emissions and beat traffic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/"> are going national</a>.</p>
<h3>An Indian empire arises</h3>
<p><strong>Ola Electric</strong>, the electric scooter manufacturing arm of ride-hailing giant Ola, is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">raise between $250 million to $500 million</a> in new financing as it looks to scale its business in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital, which is potentially leading the round, values the company between $2.75 billion and $3.5 billion, which is up $1 billion from its previous 2019 raise. Side note: Ola, the initial parent firm of Ola Electric, is currently looking to file for an initial public offering.</p>
<h3>Big box bike sales</h3>
<p><strong>Best Buy</strong> has a <a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-rides-into-electric-transportation-with-e-bikes-scooters-mopeds-and-more/">fresh lineup of electric vehicles</a> that are available online now and coming to select stores in October, including many we&#8217;ve written about here, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"><strong>Unagi</strong> scooter</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">new <strong>Bird </strong>bike</a>. Other top names include <strong>Segway-Ninebot</strong>, <strong>SUPER73</strong> and <strong>SWFT</strong>.</p>
<p>Speaking of new swag, <strong>VAAST Bikes</strong> has just revealed the E/1, the latest in the company&#8217;s sustainable bike range. The urban e-bike boasts a top notch suspension system that separates pedaling from suspension movement for a more comfortable ride, no matter how much cargo you&#8217;re packing. A step-through frame provides a low center of gravity, making it an easy enough bike to mount for riders of all ages and shapes and sizes. The E/1 will be available to purchase in the U.S., U.K. and European markets starting October, and it costs anywhere from $7,499 to $9,999.</p>
<p>Foldable e-bike maker <strong>Fiido</strong> has raised over $1 million on Indiegogo to fund the production and delivery of its new Fiido X. It&#8217;s got a sweet-looking minimalist design with a light and sturdy body, as well as improved pedal-assist and cycling control. Fiido says this bike is the world&#8217;s first folding e-bike with a built-in seat pole that transmits battery power. It&#8217;s got a 417.6Wh ternary lithium battery, which means when it&#8217;s in &#8220;moped mode&#8221; the range is over 130 kilometers, or around 81 miles. Not bad at all. Price is anywhere from $1,098 to $1,601 at the moment.</p>
<p>Swedish electric motorbike manufacturer <strong>Cake</strong> also recently released a new super lightweight e-moped that&#8217;s built for city utility riding, but can probably handle some off-road fun. The Makka weighs about 132 pounds and comes in two forms: The Makka Range, at $3,500, which is available only in Europe, has a lower maximum speed of 15 miles per hour and a range of up to 35 miles. The Makka Flex, which is available in Europe and the U.S., costs $3,800 and can hit top speeds of 28 miles per hour. The range of this vehicle is slightly less, at 30 miles.</p>
<h3>National Drive Electric Week (sans cars)</h3>
<p>This is the first National Drive Electric Week that has nothing to do with cars! Fabulous. At this free, two-part expert webinar, a range of experts will talk about how to get moving on two e-wheels and discuss whether or not cars are overrated (they are). Find out how policymakers and advocates are thinking about how we can get electric micromobility and public transit to dominate the roads, rather than cars, even electric ones. The event takes place Saturday, September 25 from 11am to 1pm PST on Zoom. You can register here.</p>
<h3>Van Moof&#8217;s big raise</h3>
<p><strong>VanMoof</strong>, the Amsterdam-based startup, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/vanmoof-raises-128-million-to-become-the-worlds-leading-e-bike-brand/">$128 million Series C funding round</a>, fund it plans to use in its bid to become the world&#8217;s leading e-bike brand. It&#8217;s tactic, scale faster than the rest.</p>
<p>Asia-based private equity firm Hillhouse Investment led the round, with Gillian Tans, the former CEO of Booking.com, also participating. Some existing investors also put some more money on the table, such as Norwest Venture Partners, Felix Capital, Balderton Capital and TriplePoint Capital.</p>
<p>The Series C represents a big jump compared to the company&#8217;s Series B. Last year, VanMoof raised a $40 million Series B. The startup has raised $182 million in total.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This week, I want to focus on one deal that appears to be at risk.</p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an influential shareholder adviser, issued a report this week recommending that investors in Ken Moelis&#8217;s Atlas Crest Investment Corp. should vote against a merger with Archer Aviation. The adviser said it would be better for investors if they redeemed their holdings in the blank-check company for cash.</p>
<p>If investors take that advice, it could derail the proposed merger between Atlas Crest and Archer, a startup that is developing vertical take-off and landing electric aircraft. ISS argues that Archer&#8217;s legal battle with Wisk Aero puts the company at risk. The firm also points to the falling valuation of the combined company.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/moelis-spac-shareholders-advised-by-iss-to-vote-down-archer-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg noted this week</a>, ISS has targeted other SPAC deals involving eVTOL companies. ISS opposed the merger between Reinvent Technology Partners and Joby Aviation. Shareholders ignored ISS and vote to approve the merger. ISS also advised against investing in Qell Acquisition Corp.&#8217;s merger with Lililum GmbH. That deal is still pending.</p>
<p>While ISS seems to have a general distaste for eVTOL SPACs, the Archer deal is particularly sticky due to its current legal wrangling with Wisk Aero. For those who haven&#8217;t been following: Wisk Aero, the air mobility company born out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, filed a lawsuit in April against Archer Aviation alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<p>Archer didn&#8217;t scuttle into a corner. The company countersued in a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero.</p>
<p>Investors won&#8217;t be able to take the wait-and-see approach. The vote to approve the SPAC merger will be held long before this legal fight is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carsome Group</strong>, the Malaysian-based online marketplace for buying and selling used cars, raised $170 million from investors, including from semiconductor maker MediaTek, investment company Catcha Group and Malaysian government fund Penjana Kapital, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/09/01/malaysias-carsome-reaches-13-billion-valuation-in-funding-round-from-mediatek-and-others/?sh=1b0f23677a3c">Forbes reported</a>.

Gatik said it has raised $85 million in a Series B round led by new investor Koch Disruptive Technologies, the venture arm of Koch Industries. Existing investors Innovation Endeavours, Wittington Ventures, FM Capital, Dynamo Ventures, Trucks VC, Intact Ventures and others also participated. Gatik has raised $114.5 million to date.</p>

<p><strong>Iconiq Motors</strong>, a Chinese electric vehicle firm, is considering going public in the U.S. through a merger with a blank-check company, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/chinese-ev-startup-iconiq-said-to-mull-4-billion-u-s-spac-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The startup is working with an adviser on a potential deal that could value the combined company at about $4 billion, according to one source cited by the media outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Kevala</strong>, the startup that collects and analyzes energy grid infrastructure data for utility companies, renewable energy providers, EV charging companies, regulators and other energy industry stakeholders, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/kevala-raises-21m-to-improve-tools-for-managing-energy-grid-infrastructure/">raised $21 million in a Series A round</a>. The company says it will use the funds to grow its team from 60 employees to around 100 by the end of 2021 and increase the deployment of its grid analytics tools.</p>

The company says the round was oversubscribed, and that it doubled its revenue growth in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Yandex</strong>, the Russian internet giant that also operates a ride-haling company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/yandex-buys-out-ubers-stake-in-yandex-self-driving-group-eats-lavka-and-delivery-for-1b/">acquired Uber&#8217;s stake</a> in its Self-Driving Group (SDG), as well as Uber&#8217;s indirect interest in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery. The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Zeekr</strong>, the electric vehicle brand by Geely, raised $500 million in its first external funding from a list of investors, including Intel Capital, battery maker CATL and online entertainment firm Bilibili.

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! Let&#8217;s talk safety. ​​Traffic deaths spiked in the<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-09/Early-Estimate-Motor-Vehicle-Traffic-Fatalities-Q1-2021.pdf"> first quarter of this year</a>, according to preliminary data from the <strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong>. The agency estimated that there was a 10 percent increase in fatalities from previous projections, finding that 8,730 people died in motor traffic accidents, up from the 7,900 projected. Oddly, deaths spiked even though there was an overall decrease in the number of people on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must address the tragic loss of life we saw on the roads in 2020 by taking a transformational and collaborative approach to safety,&#8221; NHTSA&#8217;s acting administrator, Steven Cliff, said in a statement. &#8220;Everyone &#8212; including those who design, operate, build and use the road system &#8212; shares responsibility for road safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>NHTSA is arguably starting to come up against some of the greatest challenges in the agency&#8217;s history, as technological development has brought about a greater degree of driving autonomy and driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>The forthcoming investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot could be a watershed moment for ADAS safety standards. If you aren&#8217;t caught up: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">NHTSA opened an investigation</a> into 11 instances of a Tesla crashing into a parked emergency vehicle, and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/">added another crash to its investigation</a> earlier this week. In an <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INIM-PE21020-84913P.pdf">11-page letter</a> to the electric vehicle maker, NHTSA gave the company until October 22 to provide extensive data on any hardware and software related to Tesla&#8217;s Level 2 capabilities (including Autopilot).</p>
<p>The probe comes as more and more groups &#8212; including the Insurance <strong>Institute for Highway Safety</strong> and <strong>Advocates for Highway &amp; Auto Safety</strong>, as well as the <strong>National Traffic Safety Board</strong> &#8212; call on NHTSA to exercise greater authority over regulating ADAS systems. We&#8217;ll certainly be keeping an eye on this investigation as it unfolds in the coming months.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Motional</strong> revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/motional-reveals-its-hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-robotaxi/">first images of its planned robotaxi</a>, a Hyundai all-electric Ioniq 5 SUV that will be the centerpiece of a driverless ride-hailing service the company wants customers to be able to access starting in 2023 through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>The purpose-built vehicle, which will be assembled by Hyundai, is integrated with Motional&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, including a suite of more than 30 sensors including lidar, radar and cameras that can be seen throughout the interior and exterior. That sensing system provides 360 degrees of vision, and the ability to see up to 300 meters away, according to Motional.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp</strong>. unveiled a &#8220;cargo&#8221; version of its flagship three-wheeled, single-occupant, all-electric SOLO at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in California.</p>
<p><strong>Power Global</strong>, a two-year-old startup, wants to disrupt the auto rickshaw market by offering a retrofit kit for diesel-powered vehicles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/power-global-wants-to-disrupt-indias-auto-rickshaw-industry-with-a-swappable-battery-and-retrofit-kit/">swappable battery pack</a> to transition the more common lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> announced that the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/rivians-electric-r1t-pickup-truck-r1s-suv-get-their-official-epa-ranges/">official EPA range of 314 miles</a>, while its R1T SUV comes in a skosh higher at 316 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Siemens</strong> said it will expand its U.S. manufacturing operations to support electric vehicle infrastructure. Specifically, the company plans to open a third facility to its VersiCharge Level 2 AC series product line of commercial and residential EV chargers. The additional facility, which is expected to come online in early 2022, will allow Siemens to manufacture more than 1 million electric vehicle chargers for the United States over the next four years.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch editor Mike Butcher</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/acquired-by-mercedes-benz-yasas-revolutionary-electric-motor-is-set-for-big-things/">digs into YASA</a>, the British electric motor startup that Mercedes-Benz acquired back in July The company, founded in 2009 after spinning out of Oxford University, developed an &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor. YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s AMG.EA electric-only platform.</p>
<p><strong>Wallbox</strong>, an electric vehicle charging company, has selected Arlington, Texas as the location of its first U.S. manufacturing facility. Production at the 130,000-square-foot plant is expected to start as early as June 2022. Production lines for its AC chargers lines, DC bidirectional charger, and DC fast charger for public use, are anticipated to follow in the first half of 2023. Wallbox said it expects to manufacture a total of 290,000 units annually in this facility by 2027 and reach its full capacity of 500,000 units by 2030.</p>
<h3>Gig economy</h3>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong> workers in California <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">protested outside of the home</a> of DoorDash CEO Tony Xu in response to a recent California superior court judge ruling calling 2020&#8217;s Proposition 22 unconstitutional. Prop 22, which was passed last November in California, would allow app-based companies like DoorDash, Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>The group of about 50 DoorDash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising  demanded that DoorDash provide transparency for tips and 120% of minimum wage or around $17 per hour, stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment, as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey</strong> gave a coalition of app-based service providers that includes Uber and Lyft the go-ahead to start collecting signatures needed to put a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">proposed ballot measure</a> before voters that would define drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Backers of the initiative, which is essentially a MA version of Proposition 22, would need to gather tens of thousands of signatures for the measure to make it to the November 2022 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> separately announced plans to cover the legal fees of drivers using their ride-hailing apps who are sued under Texas&#8217;s new abortion law.</p>
<p>The new law bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is typically around six weeks, and gives any individual the right to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion. That means ride-hailing app drivers, who might transport a woman to a clinic, can be sued.</p>
<p>Uber CEO <strong>Dara Khoswarshari</strong> and Lyft CEO <strong>Logan Green</strong> both took to Twitter express their opposition to the new law and announce their support to drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;TX SB8 threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go&#8211; especially women exercising their right to choose,&#8221; Green wrote on Twitter. &#8220;@Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform.</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi retweeted Green&#8217;s tweet and made the same commitment. &#8220;Right on @logangreen &#8211; drivers shouldn&#8217;t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go. Team @Uber is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green and Khosrowshahi are among the few CEOs (a list that includes Austin-based Bumble and Dallas-based Match Group) with operations in Texas that have come out in strong opposition to law.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> announced it will idle nearly all its assembly plants in North America due to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. The automaker is making a few strategic exceptions. Production of its profitable full-size SUVs will continue this week at its Arlington Assembly plant in Texas. The <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/flint.html">Flint Assembly facility</a>, where it makes heavy-duty GMC and Chevy pickup trucks and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/bowlinggreen.html">Bowling Green Assembly</a> in Kentucky, where it makes the Corvette, will also continue.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>BMW Group</strong> has committed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/bmw-groups-neue-klasse-lineup-to-focus-on-circular-economy-to-achieve-reduction-in-co2-emissions/">50% reduction</a> from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong> and husband, Chasten, announced they are parents to twins.</p>
<p>Buttigieg tweeted: &#8220;Chasten and I are beyond thankful for all the kind wishes since first sharing the news that we’re becoming parents. We are delighted to welcome Penelope Rose and Joseph August Buttigieg to our family.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corp.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/nikola-and-bosch-ink-deal-for-hydrogen-fuel-cell-modules/">reached a new agreement</a> with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola&#8217;s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola&#8217;s European operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.mobiuslabs.com">Mobius Labs</a> has closed a €5.2 million (~$6.1M) funding round off the back of increased demand for its computer vision training platform. The Series A investment is led by Ventech VC, along with Atlantic Labs, APEX Ventures, Space Capital, Lunar Ventures plus some additional angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup offers an SDK that lets the user create custom computer vision models fed with a little of their own training data &#8212; as an alternative to off-the-shelf tools which may not have the required specificity for a particular use-case.</p>
<p>It also flags a &#8216;no code&#8217; focus, saying its tech has been designed with a non-technical user in mind.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s an SDK, Mobius Labs&#8217; platform can also be deployed on premise and/or on device &#8212; rather than the customer needing to connect to a cloud service to tap into the AI tool&#8217;s utility.</p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Our custom training user interface is very simple to work with, and requires no prior technical knowledge on any level,&#8221; claims </span>Appu Shaji, CEO and chief scientist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Over the years, a trend we have observed is that often the people who get the maximum value from AI are non technical personas like a content manager in a press and creative agency, or an application manager in the space sector. Our no-code AI allows anyone to build their own applications, thus enabling these users to get close to their vision without having to wait for AI experts or developer teams to help them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mobius Labs &#8212; which was founded back in 2018 &#8212; now has 30 customers using its tools for a range of use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uses include c<span class="s1">ategorisation, recommendation, prediction, reducing operational expense, and/or &#8220;generally connecting users and audiences to visual content that is most relevant to their needs&#8221;. (Press and broadcasting and the stock photography sector have unsurprisingly been big focuses to date.)</span></p>
<p>But it reckons there&#8217;s wider utility for its tech and is gearing up for growth.</p>
<p>It caters to businesses of various sizes, from startups to SMEs, but says it mainly targets global enterprises with major content challenges &#8212; hence its historical focus on the media sector and video use cases.</p>
<p>Now, though, it&#8217;s also targeting geospatial and earth observation applications as it seeks to expand its customer base.</p>
<p>The 30-strong startup has more than doubled in size over the last 18 months. With the new funding it&#8217;s planning to double its headcount again over the next 12 months as it looks to expand its geographical footprint &#8212; focusing on Europe and the US.</p>
<p>Year-on-year growth has also been 2x but it believes it can dial that up by tapping into other sectors.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are working with industries that are rich in visual data,&#8221; says Shaji. &#8220;The geospatial sector is something that we are focussing on currently as we have a strong belief that vast amounts of visual data is being produced by them. However, these huge archives of raw pixel data are useless on their own. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For instance, if we want to track how river fronts are expanding, we have to look at data collected by satellites, sort and tag them in order to analyse them. Currently this is being done manually. The technology we are creating comes in a lightweight SDK, and can be deployed directly into these satellites so that the raw data can be detected and then analysed by machine learning algorithms. We are currently working with satellite companies in this sector.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the competitive front, <span class="s1">Shaji names </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">Clarifai</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/google-opens-its-cloud-vision-api-to-all-developers/">Google Cloud Vision</a> as the main rivals it has in its sights.  </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;We realise these are the big players but at the same time believe that we have something unique to offer, which these players cannot: Unlike their solutions, our platform users can be outside the field of computer vision. By democratising the training of machine learning models beyond simply the technical crowd, we are making computer vision accessible and understandable by anyone, regardless of their job titles,&#8221; he argues. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Another core value that differentiates us is the way we treat client data. Our solutions are delivered in the form of a Software Development Kit (SDK), which runs on-premise, completely locally on clients’ systems. No data is ever sent back to us. Our role is to empower people to build applications, and make them their own.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Computer vision startups have been a hot acquisition target in recent years and some earlier startups offering &#8216;computer vision as a service&#8217; got acquired by IT services firms to beef up their existing offerings, while tech giants like Amazon and (the aforementioned) Google offer their own computer vision services too.</p>
<p>But <span class="s1">Shaji suggests the tech is now at a different stage of development &#8212; and primed for &#8220;mass adoption&#8221;. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We’re talking about providing solutions that empower clients to build their own applications,&#8221; he says, summing up the competitive play. &#8220;And that [do that] with complete data privacy, where our solutions run on-premise, and we don’t see our clients data. Coupled with that is the ease of use that our technology offers: It is a lightweight solution that can be deployed on many ‘edge’ devices like smartphones, laptops, and even on satellites.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Stephan Wirries, partner at Ventech VC, added: “Appu and the team at Mobius Labs have developed an unparalleled offering in the computer vision space. Superhuman Vision is impressively innovative with its high degree of accuracy despite very limited required training to recognise new objects at excellent computational efficiency. We believe industries will be transformed through AI, and Mobius Labs is the European Deep Tech innovator teaching machines to see.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a>, a hosted email service with a focus on end-to-end encrypted communications, has been facing criticism after a <a href="https://twitter.com/MuArF/status/1433459776189607938">police report</a> showed that French authorities managed to obtain the IP address of a French activist who was using the online service. The company has communicated widely about the incident, stating that it doesn’t log IP addresses by default and it only complies with local regulation — in that case Swiss law. While ProtonMail didn’t cooperate with French authorities, French police sent a request to Swiss police via Europol to force the company to obtain the IP address of one of its users.</p>
<p>For the past year, a group of people have taken over a handful of commercial premises and apartments near Place Sainte Marthe in Paris. They want to fight against gentrification, real estate speculation, Airbnb and high-end restaurants. While it started as a local conflict, it quickly became a symbolic campaign. They attracted <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2021/01/02/a-paris-bras-de-fer-entre-le-restaurant-le-petit-cambodge-et-des-squatteurs-contre-la-gentrification_6065035_1653578.html">newspaper headlines</a> when they started occupying premises rented by Le Petit Cambodge — a restaurant that was targeted by the November 13th, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.</p>

<p>On September 1st, the group <a href="https://paris-luttes.info/recit-policier-de-sainte-marthe-15258?lang=fr">published an article</a> on Paris-luttes.info, an anticapitalist news website, summing up different police investigations and legal cases against some members of the group. According to their story, French police sent an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europol">Europol</a> request to ProtonMail in order to uncover the identity of the person who created a ProtonMail account — the group was using this email address to communicate. The address has also been shared on various anarchist websites.</p>
<p>The next day, @MuArF on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MuArF/status/1433459776189607938">shared</a> an abstract of a police report detailing ProtonMail’s reply. According to @MuArF, the police report is related to the ongoing investigation against the group who occupied various premises around Place Sainte-Marthe. It says that French police received a message on Europol. That message contains details about the ProtonMail account.</p>
<p>Here’s what the report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The company PROTONMAIL informs us that the email address has been created on … The IP address linked to the account is the following: …</li>
<li>The device used is a … device identified with the number …</li>
<li>The data transmitted by the company is limited to that due to the privacy policy of PROTONMAIL TECHNOLOGIES.”</li>
</ul>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>ProtonMail’s founder and CEO Andy Yen reacted to the police report <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434588316914130949">on Twitter</a> without mentioning the specific circumstances of that case in particular. “Proton must comply with Swiss law. As soon as a crime is committed, privacy protections can be suspended and we’re required by Swiss law to answer requests from Swiss authorities,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In particular, Andy Yen wants to make it clear that his company didn’t cooperate with French police nor Europol. It seems like Europol acted as the communication channel between French authorities and Swiss authorities. At some point, Swiss authorities took over the case and sent a request to ProtonMail directly. The company references these requests as “foreign requests approved by Swiss authorities” in its <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/">transparency report</a>.</p>

<p>&mdash; Andy Yen (@andyyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434588316914130949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch contacted ProtonMail founder and CEO Andy Yen with questions about the case.</p>
<p>One key question is exactly when the targeted account holder was notified that their data had been requested by Swiss authorities since — per ProtonMail — notification is obligatory under Swiss law.</p>
<p>However, Yen told us that — “for privacy and legal reasons” — he is unable to comment on specific details of the case or provide “non-public information on active investigations”, adding: “You would have to direct these inquiries to the Swiss authorities.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he did point us to <a href="https://protonmail.com/law-enforcement">this public page</a>, where ProtonMail provides information for law enforcement authorities seeking data about users of its end-to-end encrypted email service, including setting out a “ProtonMail user notification policy”.</p>
<p>Here the company reiterates that Swiss law “requires a user to be notified if a third party makes a request for their private data and such data is to be used in a criminal proceeding” &#8212; however it also notes that “in certain circumstances” a notification “can be delayed”.</p>
<p>Per this policy, Proton says delays can affect notifications if: There is a temporary prohibition on notice by the Swiss legal process itself, by Swiss court order or “applicable Swiss law”; or where “based on information supplied by law enforcement, we, in our absolute discretion, believe that providing notice could create a risk of injury, death, or irreparable damage to an identifiable individual or group of individuals.”</p>
<p>“As a general rule though, targeted users will eventually be informed and afforded the opportunity to object to the data request, either by ProtonMail or by Swiss authorities,” the policy adds.</p>
<p>So, in the specific case, it looks likely that ProtonMail was either under legal order to delay notification to the account holder &#8212; given what appears to be up to eight months between the logging being instigated and disclosure of it &#8212; or it had been provided with information by the Swiss authorities which led it to conclude that delaying notice was essential to avoid a risk of “injury, death, or irreparable damage” to a person or persons (NB: it is unclear what “irreparable damage” means in this context, and whether it could be interpreted figuratively &#8212; as ‘damage’ to a person’s/group’s interests, for example, such as to a criminal investigation, not solely bodily harm &#8212; which would make the policy considerably more expansive).</p>
<p>In either scenario the level of transparency being afforded to individuals by Swiss law having a mandatory notification requirement when a person’s data has been requested looks severely limited if the same law authorities can, essentially, gag notifications &#8212; potentially for long periods (seemingly more than half a year in this specific case).</p>
<p>ProtonMail’s public disclosures also log an alarming rise in requests for data by Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/">transparency report</a>, ProtonMail received 13 orders from Swiss authorities back in 2017 — but that had swelled to over three and a half thousand (3,572!) by 2020.</p>
<p>The number of foreign requests to Swiss authorities which are being approved has also risen, although not as steeply — with ProtonMail reporting receiving 13 such requests in 2017 — rising to 195 in 2020.</p>
<p>The company says it complies with lawful requests for user data but it also says it contests orders where it does not believe them to be lawful. And its reporting shows an increase in contested orders &#8212; with ProtonMail contesting three orders back in 2017 but in 2020 it pushed back against 750 of the data requests it received.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Swiss government determined that this case met the legal standard under Swiss law. Unfortunately there was no possibility to appeal that ruling in this case. However, we always fight when we can (and in 2020, we fought over 700 cases on behalf of users).</p>
<p>&mdash; Andy Yen (@andyyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434814265559506946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Per ProtonMail’s <a href="https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, the information it can provide on a user account in response to a valid request under Swiss law may include account information provided by the user (such as an email address); account activity/metadata (such as sender, recipient email addresses; IP addresses incoming messages originated from; the times messages were sent and received; message subjects etc); total number of messages, storage used and last login time; and unencrypted messages sent from external providers to ProtonMail. As an end-to-end encrypted email provider, it cannot decrypt email data so is unable to provide information on the contents of email, even when served with a warrant.</p>
<p>However in its transparency report, the company also signals an additional layer of data collection which it may be (legally) obligated to carry out &#8212; writing that: “In addition to the items listed in our privacy policy, in extreme criminal cases, ProtonMail may also be obligated to monitor the IP addresses which are being used to access the ProtonMail accounts which are engaged in criminal activities.”</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s that IP monitoring component which has caused such alarm among privacy advocates now &#8212; and no small criticism of Proton’s marketing claims as a ‘user privacy centric’ company.</p>
<p>It has faced particular criticism for marketing claims of providing “anonymous email” and for the wording of the caveat in its transparency disclosure &#8212; where it talks about IP logging only occurring in “extreme criminal cases”.</p>
<p>Few would agree that anti-gentrification campaigners meet that bar.</p>
<p>At the same time, Proton does provide users with <a href="https://protonmail.com/tor">an onion address</a> &#8212; meaning activists concerned about tracking can access its encrypted email service using Tor which makes it harder for their IP address to be tracked. So it is providing tools for users to protect themselves against IP monitoring (as well as protect the contents of their emails from being snooped on), even though its own service can, in certain circumstances, be turned into an IP monitoring tool by Swiss law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the backlash around the revelation of the IP logging of the French activists, Yen said via Twitter that ProtonMail will be providing a more prominent link to its onion address on its website:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, we will be updating this today to link to our Tor page.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Proton does also offer a VPN service of its own &#8212; and Yen has claimed that Swiss law does not allow it to log its VPN users’ IP addresses. So it’s interesting to speculate whether the activists might have been able to evade the IP logging if they had been using both Proton’s end-to-end encrypted email and its VPN service…</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, there is no legal basis for logging VPN under current Swiss law.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“If they were using Tor or ProtonVPN, we would have been able to provide an IP, but it would be the IP of the VPN server, or the IP of the Tor exit node,” Yen told TechCrunch when we asked about this.</p>
<p>“We do protect against this threat model via our Onion site (protonmail.com/tor),” he added. “In general though, unless you are based 15 miles offshore in international waters, it is not possible to ignore court orders.”</p>
<p>“The Swiss legal system, while not perfect, does provide a number of checks and balances, and it&#39;s worth noting that even in this case, approval from three authorities in two countries was required, and that&#39;s a fairly high bar which prevents most (but not all) abuse of the system.”</p>

<p>“The prosecution in this case seems quite aggressive,” it added. “Unfortunately, this is a pattern we have increasingly seen in recent years around the world (for example in France where terror laws are inappropriately used). We will continue to campaign against such laws and abuses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian logistics firm Delhivery has courted one more high-profile investor before its expected IPO in the next two quarters: Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm has disclosed in a regulatory filing that Addition has invested $76.4 million in the startup. The new investment is part of a Series I round, according to the filing, provided by market intelligence firm Tofler. So far Delhivery has disclosed only Addition&#8217;s investment.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old startup began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes. It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>
<p>The new investment comes months after a subsidiary of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/">FedEx invested $100 million in Delhivery</a>, and the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/indian-logistics-giant-delhivery-raises-277-million-ahead-of-ipo/">separately closed a $277 million financing round</a>. The startup has said earlier this year that it was looking to file for an IPO within the next six to nine months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159174" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159174" class="wp-caption-text">A look at Delhivery&#8217;s network. (Bernstein)</p></div></p>
<p>Delhivery is one of the largest logistics firms in India. Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking — the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery — more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases carrying costs, theft, damages and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 square kilometers, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts wrote in a report to clients earlier this year. The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Lee Fixel, a renowned name in the Indian startup ecosystem, is one of the first global investment partners to see potential in India. His early investment through Tiger Global in Flipkart in the past decade accelerated the pace at which the startup ecosystem in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market has grown.</p>
<p>Addition, a venture firm Fixel founded last year, has already started to pay attention to India, where it has also backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/indian-social-network-public-app-raises-41-million/">Public social network</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/nubank-co-leads-45-million-investment-in-indian-neobank-jupiter/">neobank Jupiter</a>.</p>
<p>Fixel also continues to write personal checks to Indian startups. He is currently in talks to back the Bangalore-based coffee chain Third Wave, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK tech accelerator <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/">Founders Factory</a> is joining forces with a European counterpart to launch the <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/sustainability-seed-program">Founders Factory Sustainability Seed program</a>. Launched in partnership with G-Force (the G is for Green) based out of Bratislava, Slovakia, the program will look to invest in and accelerate climate-tech startups.</p>
<p>The program will invest in entrepreneurs with startups that can reduce the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, speed up the transition to a circular economy, create sustainable housing and manufacturing solutions, as well as address climate-friendly mobility, food/feed production, and capturing/storing CO2 and methane.</p>
<p>The Program, run with G-Force largely out of Bratislava, Slovakia, will be operated in a “hybrid” manner: mixing remote and in-person support. The idea is that any eco-tech venture in any location in the world can apply and join the program.</p>
<p>Founders Factory’s partner in the Sustainability Seed program, G-Force, is being backed financially by a syndicate of Central and Eastern European investors including Boris Zelený (figure behind AVG, which sold to AVAST for $1.4bn), Marian Gazdik (Startup Grind), and early-stage investors Peter Külloi and Miklós Kóbor.</p>
<p>Startups selected program for the will get a Seed investment of up to €150,000, six months of startup support using Founders Factory’s team, as well as introductions to potential customers, partners, corporates, and investors.</p>
<p>Henry Lane Fox,  Chief Executive Officer at Founders Factory, said: “By nurturing the disruption entrepreneurs are so good at creating we can design a better, more sustainable future for all. In partnership with G-Force, Founders Factory Sustainability Seed Program will be a leading pre/seed program committed to building and supporting the ventures that will have a positive impact on the world.”</p>
<p>Marian Gazdik, co-founding partner of G-Force, said: “Our ambition is to make G-Force, in partnership with the Founders Factory Sustainability Seed Program, into a world-class sustainability innovation hub, based in the heart of Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Expanding on the idea, Lane-Fox told me: “In this particular case, rather than being aligned to one individual corporate partner, which has been our model to date, we&#8217;re able to bring together a group of angel investors and make this more of a pure financial investor play. We think that actually suits this specific sector better. We will also be providing a bit more capital to those companies early on to make sure they can benefit from the program to the maximum degree.”</p>
<p>Gazdik added that by being based in the EU rather than the UK, the program will also be able to take advantage of some EU grant programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian automotive tech company Autochek today is announcing the acquisition of Cheki Kenya and Uganda from Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM) for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a statement, Autochek </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will finalize the deal in the coming weeks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the acquisition, Autochek completes its expansion into East Africa and follows the first acquisition made almost a year ago <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/14/autochek-acquires-cheki-ghana-nigeria/">when it acquired both Nigeria and Ghana businesses from Cheki</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, Cheki launched as an online car classified for dealers, importers, and private sellers in Kenya. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, headquartered in Nairobi, expanded operations to Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheki got acquired by ROAM in 2017 and joined a list of online marketplaces and classifieds in its network like Jobberman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per ROAM&#8217;s website, Cheki still has operations in Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these markets are quite inactive so it is safe to say Autochek has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cheki&#8217;s main operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheki Kenya is an exciting market for both parties. The subsidiary has 700,000 users and lists over 12,000 vehicles monthly. It also claims to have grown 80% year-on-year in the last two years, making it a valuable asset for Autochek&#8217;s plan for regional expansion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cheki Kenya has always been sort of the crown jewel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Autochek CEO Etop Ikpe said to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the time, when we completed the Nigeria and Ghana acquisition, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious effort to make this happen, but it&#8217;s great that it happened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2074850 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg 6420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit penetration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vehicle financing is higher in Kenya than in Nigeria and Ghana. The East African country has a 27.5% penetration compared to the whole West African market at 5%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it explains why Autochek is optimistic about the East African market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making the acquisition, the one-year-old company ran a stealthy pilot with some banks in Kenya &#8212; a similar strategy used in Ghana and Nigeria &#8212; to provide car owners with financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, the acquisition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cements the company&#8217;s position in the market, Ikpe says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sale of Cheki operations in all of its major markets, which happened within a year, might lead some to ask if the four entities did poorly and forced the classifieds giant to find a suitable buyer quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But CEO Ikpe refuted any claims of a distress sale when asked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stated that the acquisition happened in quick succession because both parties understood that the classifieds model (run by Cheki) needed to make way for the more modern transactional model (employed by Autochek and leading automotive players in Africa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Therefore, ROAM Africa saw it as a needed transition for Cheki. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off Ikpe&#8217;s past relationship with Ringier (one arm of ROAM before the merger), where he ran DealDey, a classifieds deal company Ringier </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought, it wasn&#8217;t a tough decision to sell the company to Autochek, Ikpe tells TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for them it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long term strategy and they believe in our business model. And there&#8217;s a lot of hope that we can do things in the future. It was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about finding the right home for the business and their employees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a statement, ROAM CEO Clemens Weitz said, “Across the world, we see a new evolution of digital automotive platforms, requiring deep specialization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Autochek is the one player with the best team and expertise to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create a game-changing consumer experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For ROAM Africa, this deal is more than a very good transaction: It unleashes even more focus on our strategic playbook for our other businesses.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek&#8217;s expansion to East Africa is coming at a time when automotive tech companies like Moove, Planet42, and FlexClub are receiving attention from investors as the need for flexible vehicle financing keeps growing across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important car financing market on the continent is arguably South Africa. Other automotive companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have some form of presence in the market and for Autochek, the plan is to expand there too, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understandably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa is the crème de la crème market and has the highest car financing penetration on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yet despite the seeming competition, Ikpe believes opportunities exist for the company to provide services tailored to the market different from what other companies have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty of our platform is that we can be diverse; for instance, we can have a retail or B2B approach. There&#8217;s a lot of dynamic ways we can work. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s natural that our goal is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be in every region. We&#8217;ve made our inroads into East and West, and we&#8217;ll continue to work as we want to be in North and South Africa,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Autochek says a funding round is in the works to execute on this front and might close before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://factorialhr.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorial</a>, a startup out of Barcelona that has built a platform that lets SMBs run human resources functions with the same kind of tools that typically are used by much bigger companies, is today announcing some funding to bulk up its own position: the company has raised $80 million, funding that it will be using to expand its operations geographically &#8212; specifically deeper into Latin American markets &#8212; and to continue to augment its product with more features.</p>
<p>CEO Jordi Romero, who co-founded the startup with Pau Ramon and Bernat Farrero &#8212; said in an interview that Factorial has seen a huge boom of growth in the last 18 months and counts more than anything 75,000 customers across 65 countries, with the average size of each customer in the range of 100 employees, although they can be significantly (single-digit) smaller or potentially up to 1,000 (the &#8220;M&#8221; of SMB, or SME as it&#8217;s often called in Europe).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a generous definition of SME,&#8221; Romero said of how the company first started with a target of 10-15 employees but is now working in the size bracket that it is. &#8220;But that is the limit. This is the segment that needs the most help. We see other competitors of ours are trying to move into SME and they are screwing up their product by making it too complex. SMEs want solutions that have as much data as possible in one single place. That is unique to the SME.&#8221; Customers can include smaller franchises of much larger organizations, too: KFC, Booking.com, and Whisbi are among those that fall into this category for Factorial.</p>
<p>Factorial offers a one-stop shop to manage hiring, onboarding, payroll management, time off, performance management, internal communications and more. Other services such as the actual process of payroll or sourcing candidates, it partners and integrates closely with more localized third parties.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Tiger Global, and past investors CRV, Creandum, Point Nine and K Fund also participating, at a valuation we understand from sources close to the deal to be around $530 million post-money. Factorial has raised $100 million to date, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16 million Series A</a> round in early 2020, just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic really taking hold of the world.</p>
<p>That timing turned out to be significant: Factorial, as you might expect of an HR startup, was shaped by Covid-19 in a pretty powerful way.</p>
<p>The pandemic, as we have seen, massively changed how &#8212; and where &#8212; many of us work. In the world of desk jobs, offices largely disappeared overnight, with people shifting to working at home in compliance with shelter-in-place orders to curb the spread of the virus, and then in many cases staying there even after those were lifted as companies grappled both with balancing the best (and least infectious) way forward and their own employees&#8217; demands for safety and productivity. Front-line workers, meanwhile, faced a completely new set of challenges in doing their jobs, whether it was to minimize exposure to the coronavirus, or dealing with giant volumes of demand for their services. Across both, organizations were facing economics-based contractions, furloughs, and in other cases, hiring pushes, despite being office-less to carry all that out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this had an impact on HR. People who needed to manage others, and those working for organizations, suddenly needed &#8212; and were willing to pay for &#8212; new kinds of tools to carry out their roles.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t always like this. In the early days, Romero said the company had to quickly adjust to what the market was doing.</p>
<p>“We target HR leaders and they are currently very distracted with furloughs and layoffs right now, so we turned around and focused on how we could provide the best value to them,” Romero said to me during the Series A back in early 2020. Then, Factorial made its product free to use and found new interest from businesses that had never used cloud-based services before but needed to get something quickly up and running to use while working from home (and that cloud migration turned out to be a much bigger trend played out across a number of sectors). Those turning to Factorial had previously kept all their records in local files or at best a “Dropbox folder, but nothing else,&#8221; Romero said.</p>
<p>It also provided tools specifically to address the most pressing needs HR people had at the time, such as guidance on how to implement furloughs and layoffs, best practices for communication policies and more. “We had to get creative,” Romero said.</p>
<p class="p1">But it wasn&#8217;t all simple. &#8220;We did suffer at the beginning,&#8221; Romero now says. &#8220;People were doing furloughs and [frankly] less attention was being paid to software purchasing. People were just surviving. Then gradually, people realized they needed to improve their systems in the cloud, to manage remote people better, and so on.&#8221; So after a couple of very slow months, things started to take off, he said.</p>
<p>Factorial&#8217;s rise is part of a much, longer-term bigger trend in which the enterprise technology world has at long last started to turn its attention to how to take the tools that originally were built for larger organizations, and right size them for smaller customers.</p>
<p>The metrics are completely different: large enterprises are harder to win as customers, but represent a giant payoff when they do sign up; smaller enterprises represent genuine scale since there are so many of them globally &#8212; <a href="https://globalnaps.org/issue/small-medium-enterprises-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">400 million</a>, accounting for 95% of all firms worldwide. But so are the product demands, as Romero pointed out previously: SMBs also want powerful tools, but they need to work in a more efficient, and out-of-the-box way.</p>
<p>Factorial is not the only HR startup that has been honing in on this, of course. Among the wider field are PeopleHR, Workday, Infor, ADP, Zenefits, Gusto, IBM, Oracle, SAP and Rippling; and a very close competitor out of Europe, Germany&#8217;s Personio, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$125 million on a $1.7 billion valuation</a> earlier this year, speaking not just to the opportunity but the success it is seeing in it.</p>
<p>But the major fragmentation in the market, the fact that there are so many potential customers, and Factorial&#8217;s own rapid traction are three reasons why investors approached the startup, which was not proactively seeking funding when it decided to go ahead with this Series B.</p>
<p>“The HR software market opportunity is very large in Europe, and Factorial is incredibly well positioned to capitalize on it,” said John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “Our diligence found a product that delighted customers and a world-class team well-positioned to achieve Factorial’s potential.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It is now clear that labor markets around the world have shifted over the past 18 months,” added Reid Christian, general partner at CRV, which led its previous round, which had been CRV&#8217;s first investment in Spain. “This has strained employers who need to manage their HR processes and properly serve their employees. Factorial was always architected to support employers across geographies with their HR and payroll needs, and this has only accelerated the demand for their platform. We are excited to continue to support the company through this funding round and the next phase of growth for the business.”</p>
<p>Notably, Romero told me that the fundraising process really evolved between the two rounds, with the first needing him flying around the world to meet people, and the second happening over video links, while he was recovering himself from Covid-19. Given that it was not too long ago that the most ambitious startups in Europe were encouraged to relocate to the U.S. if they wanted to succeed, it seems that it&#8217;s not just the world of HR that is rapidly shifting in line with new global conditions.</p>
