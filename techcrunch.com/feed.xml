										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the oldest of 12 children, Bunim Laskin spent much of his teen years looking for ways to help keep his siblings entertained. Noticing that a neighbor’s pool was often empty, Laskin reached out to ask if his family could use her pool. To make it worth her while, he suggested that they could help cover her expenses for maintaining the pool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, five other families had made the same arrangement with her and the pool owner had six families covering 25% of her expenses. This meant that the neighbor was actually making money off her pool. The arrangement sparked a business idea in Laskin’s mind. At the age of 20, he founded <a href="http://www.swimply.com">Swimply</a>, a marketplace for homeowners to rent out their underutilized pools to local swimmers, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asher Weinberger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cedarhurst, New York-based company launched a beta in 2018, starting with four pools in the New Jersey area. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We used Google Earth to find houses, and then knocked on 80 doors with a pool,” Laskin recalls. “We got to 100 pools organically. Word of mouth really helped us grow.” The site was pretty bare bones, he admits, with potential customers only able to view photos of the pools and connect with the pool owner by phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, Swimply did around 400 reservations and raised $1.2 million from friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Swimply launched what he describes as a “proper” website and app with an automated platform. It grew “4 to 5 times” that year, again mostly organically. In an episode that aired in March 2020, the company appeared on Shark Tank but went home without a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Swimply, Laskin said, pivoted right into the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were the perfect solution for people when the world was falling on its head,” he said. The company restructured its offering to ensure that pool owners did not have to interact with guests. “It was the perfect, contact-free, self-serve experience to hang out and be with people you quarantined with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC then came out to say that it was safe to swim because chlorine could help kill the virus, and that proved to be a big boon to its business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On one end, it was a way for people to have a normal day and on the other, it helped give owners a way to earn an income, at a time when many people were being affected financially,” Laskin told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business took off in 2020 with revenue growing 4,000% and now Swimply is announcing a $10 million Series A round. Norwest Venture Partners led the financing, which also included participation from Trust Ventures and a number of angel investors such as Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra; Rob Chesnut, former general counsel and chief ethics officer at Airbnb; Ancestry.com CEO Deborah Liu and Michael Curtis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply is now operating in a total of 125 U.S. markets, two markets in Canada and five markets in Australia. It plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new markets and toward product development.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147921" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147921" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2147921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="574" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147921" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swimply</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is pretty straightforward. Swimply simply connects homeowners that have underutilized backyard spaces and pools with those seeking a way to gather, cool off or exercise, for example. People or families can rent pools by the hour, ranging in price from $15 to $60 per hour (at an average of $45/hour) depending on the amenities. New markets that Swimply has recently expanded to include Portland, Oregon; Raleigh, NC and the California cities of Oakland, San Luis Obispo and Los Gatos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The shifting mindset from younger generations about ownership is a huge contributor to increased growth of the Swimply marketplace,” said co-founder Weinberger, who serves as Swimply’s COO. “Swimming is the third most popular activity for adults and number one for children, and yet no other company has tackled the aquatic space to make swimming more affordable and accessible&#8230;until now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company declined to provide hard revenue figures, Laskin said Swimply was seeing “7 digits a month in revenue” and 15,000 to 20,000 reservations a month. Families represent the most popular reservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can book and pay through our platform, and only 20% of hosts ever meet their guests,” Laskin said. “We’re enabling a new kind of consumer behavior with what we’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use its new capital to also rebuild much of its tech infrastructure and boost its customer support team to be more “readily available.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also now offering a complimentary up to $1 million worth of insurance per booking for liability as well as $10,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply has a little over 20 employees, up 10 times from 2 people in December of 2020. It plans to double that number over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s model has proven quite lucrative for some owners, according to Laskin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, there were some owners who earned $10,000 a month. One owner in Denver earned $50,000 last year and he had signed up toward the end of the summer. He should make over $100,000 this year,” Lasken projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its only criteria is that owners offer a clean pool. Eighty five percent of hosts offer restrooms as well. If they don’t, they are limited to one-hour reservations with a max of five guests. Swimply has also partnered with local pool companies, and if they pay one of its owners a visit and certify that pool, that owner gets a badge on the site “so guests get an additional level of security,” Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Yip of Norwest Venture Partners admits that when he first heard of the concept of Swimply, he “didn’t know what to make of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the more he heard about it, the more excited he got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the holy grail for a consumer investor. We’re not changing consumer behavior, but rather productize the experience and make it safer and easier on both sides,” Yip told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What also gets the investor excited is the potential for Swimply beyond just swimming pools in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing a ton of demand from hosts wanting to list hot tubs and tennis courts, for example,” Yip said. “So this can turn into a marketplace for shared outdoor resources and that’s a huge market opportunity that adds value on both sides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the concept of monetizing underutilized space is a growing concept. Earlier this year, we reported on Neighbor, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hich operates a self-storage marketplace, raising $53 million in a Series B round of funding. Neighbor’s unique model aims to repurpose under-utilized or vacant space — whether it be a person’s basement or the empty floor of an office building — and turn it into storage.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the same time as it&#8217;s cracking down on the advertising businesses run by rivals, Apple is introducing a new way for developers to advertise on the App Store. Previously, developers could promote their apps after users initiated a search on the App Store by targeting specific keywords. For example, if you typed in &#8220;taxi,&#8221; you might then see an ad by Uber in the top slot above the search results. The new ad slot, however, will reach users <em>before</em> they search. This can expose the app to a wider audience.</p>
<p>This new and more prominent ad placement is found on the App Store&#8217;s Search tab, which sees millions of visits from Apple device owners every month. Today, the Search tab offers two sections below the search box itself: a &#8220;Discover&#8221; section that highlights current App Store trends, and a &#8220;Suggested&#8221; section with recommended apps and games to try. The ad will appear in the latter section at the top of the list of Suggested apps.</p>
<p>These new ad placements, which Apple calls &#8220;<a href="https://searchads.apple.com/help/advanced/0071-book-search-tab-campaigns/">Search tab campaigns</a>,&#8221; are being made available as part of Apple&#8217;s Search Ads Advanced service, and can take advantage of the assets that developers have already uploaded to their App Store product page &#8212; like the app&#8217;s name, icon, and subtitle. Because developers are buying a direct placement on the App Store, they don&#8217;t need to submit keywords as they would for other App Store ads, nor any other creative assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2147909" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147909" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=768,692 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147909" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Like the existing Search results campaigns, there&#8217;s no minimum spend required for a Search tab campaign. Developers can spend as little or as much as they want, then start, stop or adjust the campaign at any time, says Apple. Ad pricing is based on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) model. The actual cost is the result of a second price auction, which calculates what the developer will pay based on what the next closest bidder is willing to pay. Impressions are counted when at least 50% of the ad is visible for one second, Apple notes.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to expand its advertising business appears to be a calculated move timed with the launch of iOS 14.5, the latest version of the iPhone&#8217;s operating system. Through a feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency (ATT),</a> rolling out in iOS 14.5, Apple is cracking down on apps that track users&#8217; data without permission. After updating, users will see a new pop-up box appear in each app, where the developer will ask permission to collect and share the user&#8217;s information with data brokers and other third parties, if they previously collected this information without users&#8217; consent. Users can also go into their iOS Settings to turn on or off app tracking for individual apps at any time.</p>
<p>The change is shaking up the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/">$350+ billion</a> digital ad industry, led by Facebook and Google. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">Facebook has argued</a> the impacts of the change <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">will hurt small businesses</a>, who have historically relied on highly targeted, personalized ads that allow them to reach potential customers without spending a lot of money. Advertisers, meanwhile, have suggested that Apple&#8217;s changes will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863">benefit its own bottom line</a> at the expense of their own.</p>
<p>But Apple&#8217;s response, to date, has simply been that the changes were necessary to protect consumer privacy. People should have a right to know &#8220;when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites,&#8221; the company said, &#8220;and they should have the choice to allow that or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to early <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">data by Flurry Analytics</a>, only around 11% of users are opting in to being tracked after the iOS 14.5 launch. For app publishers looking to acquire new users, that could make this new ad slot look more appealing than it would have, had it launched before ATT rolled out.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s plans to launch the new ad slot were reported by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f">Financial Times</a> in April, which noted that ultimately, the changes may be more about money &#8212; they could also be about control. In years past, getting featured on the App Store could boost a company&#8217;s valuation as new users flooded in. Apple may want to shift that power away from third-parties and back to itself and its own App Store both in terms of app discovery and anointing the next hit apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peloton today <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury">announced that it will be cooperating</a> with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), agreeing to two voluntary treadmill recalls for the Tread+ and Tread versions of its home treadmill system.</p>
<p>Those who have purchased the systems can contact the connected fitness company for a refund. The company has also agreed to stop selling and distributing both models in the U.S. Last month, CEO John Foley <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">said the company was &#8220;troubled&#8221;</a> by the CPSC’s decision to go public with its findings, calling them &#8220;inaccurate and misleading.&#8221; Today&#8217;s news finds the executive offering a much more contrite statement.</p>
<p>“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families,” Foley says. “I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+.  We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize. Today’s announcement reflects our recognition that, by working closely with the CPSC, we can increase safety awareness for our Members.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The voluntary recalls are a response to on-going safety concerns around the fitness equipment. The CPSC cites more 70 incidents in total, including the death of a young child. According to the commission, &#8220;a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>CPSC acting chairman Robert S. Adler said in a statement, &#8220;I am pleased that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Peloton have come to an agreement to protect users of the Peloton Tread+ and Tread products. The agreement, which the Commission voted this morning to accept, requires Peloton to immediately stop selling and distributing both the Tread+ and Tread products in the United States and refund the full purchase price to consumers who wish to return their treadmills. The agreement between CPSC and Peloton is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The recall includes some 125,000 Tread+ (the older system, renamed with the arrival of a new budget device) and 1,050 Tread models in the U.S., along with an additional 5,400 in Canada. The warning issued alongside the Tread+ recalls states, &#8220;Adult users, children, pets and objects can be pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill, posing a risk of injury or death,&#8221; while the Tread&#8217;s notes, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The touchscreen on the treadmill can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Consumers will have until November 6, 2022 for a full refund. After that, the company will only issue an undetermined partial refund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s initial pushback owed, in part, to the fact that home fitness equipment has long been known to present safety concerns &#8212; particularly with small children and pets present. It seems likely that we&#8217;ll hear more on Peloton&#8217;s stance during tomorrow&#8217;s earnings call. The company had a banner 2020, due to the pandemic, but shares have dropped 8% on the news. Today also saw some key security concerns with its platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">go public earlier today</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is known for its pitch-offs. We&#8217;ve had them in cities all over the world, and heard from hundreds of startups who have shared the story of their company on our stages.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have FirstMark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch. Do you have what it takes? <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">You can register here for free!</a></p>

<p>To be selected for the pitch-off, you must be present in the audience during the live show. Instructions on how to raise your hand will come at the top of the show, so don&#8217;t be late!</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s an entrepreneur’s market in digital health today, with startups raising <a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/q1-2021-funding-report-digital-health-is-all-grown-up/">record-breaking</a> funding at soaring valuations and debuting on public markets to eager investors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/healthcare-unicorn-exit-activity/">CB Insights, </a>as of March 3, 2021, there are 51 healthcare unicorns &#8212; “startups” &#8212; worth $1 billion or more around the world. Global venture capital funding, including private equity and corporate VC, into digital health was the highest ever in the first quarter 2021 at <a href="https://mercomcapital.com/product/q1-2021-digital-health-healthcare-it-funding-ma-report/">$7.2 billion, according to Mercom Capital Group.</a></p>
<p>The massive influx of capital to healthcare should not be surprising; the pandemic has made it starkly clear that digital health is the future of healthcare. To that end, we should anticipate additional healthcare exits worth more than $1 billion in the near term. Which again, is great for entrepreneurs &#8212; as long as they understand how hard it is to build a unicorn in healthcare. Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Company founders most often turn to veteran investors for help with grand-slam strategies to create the next healthcare unicorn. That&#8217;s why many of them seek counsel from the <a href="http://www.merckghifund.com/">Merck Global Health Innovation Fund</a>: Because we have the experience, resources, successful track record and networks to build real scale in digital health.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, lots of investors jumped in to invest in digital health for the first time. But we&#8217;ve been investing for more than a decade. Two of our portfolio companies, <a href="https://www.preventicesolutions.com/">Preventice Solutions</a> and <a href="http://go.teladochealth.com/livongo/">Livongo, </a>exited last year as unicorns, rounding out the $6.2 billion in digital health market value MGHIF has exited over the last two years. And we are expecting two more unicorn exits in 2021. But we&#8217;re not stopping there; we&#8217;ll be investing our $500 million fund in drone-supported supply chain technologies, telehealth, AI, digital pathology, remote clinical trials and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).</p>
<p>Given our success, here are four instrumental strategies to building a unicorn in digital health that we know work.</p>
<h2>Raise the &#8220;right amount&#8221; of capital to build the right company</h2>
<p>We often ask entrepreneurs: Would you rather own 20% of a $50 million company or 5% of a $1 billion company? To most, the answer is obvious. In our experience, too many entrepreneurs worry about dilution and never raise the right amount of capital.</p>
<p>It’s well known that companies with rapidly growing revenues are valued at a premium &#8212; but it’s important to remember that this is hard to do in healthcare. Getting to scale takes time because healthcare is so complicated and involves so many stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/4007687c-0c98-483c-b742-e7fc1df3c375?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> dug into the world of the IPO. Not just the numbers and the metrics and the calculations of valuations at diluted, and non-diluted share counts. No. We wanted to talk about the morality <em>and</em> efficacy of going public.</p>
<p>So to round out our conversation we enlisted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevecakebread">Steve Cakebread</a>, the CFO of <a href="https://www.yext.com/">Yext</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garth-mitchell-34837511/">Garth Mitchell</a>, the CFO of <a href="https://www.latch.com/">Latch</a>. Cakebread is known for being aboard the Salesforce, Pandora, and Yext&#8217;s IPOs. Mitchell has sat on both sides of the table during the IPO process, and is currently helming the money equations as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">Latch approaches the public markets via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>For more context, Yext, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/01/the-25-million-demo-yext-scores-a-big-round-from-ivp-after-techcrunch50-debut/">first launched at a Techcrunch event back in 2009</a>, provides data tooling and search software to businesses, while Latch builds software and hardware for rental-focused buildings. Yext is public. Latch will be in a few months.</p>
<p>Back to our topic, we asked Cakebread to talk about his thesis on why going public earlier than later can help a company&#8217;s maturity process <em>and</em> can help provide greater returns to the general public. The CFO has written a rather good book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IPO-Playbook-Insiders-Perspective-Company/dp/1733959122">about the IPO process</a> more generally and what it means for a company&#8217;s internal processes, but his morality notes especially stood out because its an argument far less noisy than the POP critics. Baked beans comes up, somehow!</p>
<p>We also asked Mitchell to talk about Latch&#8217;s choice to go public, and what opportunities and challenges the SPAC route brings for the company. Of course, there&#8217;s a SPAC joke in there (or two), but we get into broader &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221; debates about if more companies will start to leave the private world, venture capital&#8217;s role in this whole mess, and the financial lift of going to the public market.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed the show, and get excited: Equity is going to have more guests on from time to time, and we welcome any suggestions <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">you want to throw at us. </a></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working for a large tech company on an H-1B visa for about a year and a half. I’d like to establish my own company while maintaining my current, secure job. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I keep working on the H-1B, found my own company, and then have my startup sponsor me for an H-1B or another visa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Scrappy in Santa Clara</strong></p>
<p>Hi Scrappy,</p>
<p>You need to be very careful while navigating this process because there are many different legal requirements that you need to pay careful attention to so you comply with U.S. immigration laws. But yes, it is possible for you to <em>own</em> a portion of a business on H-1B, and it is possible for a founder to obtain an H-1B transfer to <em>work </em>at the startup.</p>
<p>Take a listen to a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/069-how-to-have-2-jobs-when-youre-on-an-h-1b/">recent podcast episode</a> in which I discuss having two H-1B jobs — or concurrent H-1Bs. Concurrent H-1Bs enable your second employer — in this case, your startup — to avoid having to go through the H-1B lottery process because you have already gone through that process with your current employer.</p>
<h2>Consult with experienced attorneys</h2>
<p>Be kind to your attorneys &#8212; you will need their support to navigate this process! Before you embark on creating your startup, you should review and discuss your employment contract and NDA with an employment lawyer.</p>
<p>Big companies often require employees to obtain their consent prior to forming a startup. You should also consult with an experienced immigration attorney when considering embarking on this path and determining how to structure your startup. The H-1B has specific requirements that you and your startup must meet to qualify.</p>
<h2>Employer-employee requirement</h2>
<p>As you probably already know, the H-1B visa allows you to work for a specific employer in a specific job at a specific location. That means you cannot work for or at your startup under your current H-1B. Therefore, we often advise clients not to found any startup as a sole proprietorship. There will probably need to be a corporation or a limited liability company.</p>
<p>You may be advised to find a co-founder or two. One of the key requirements for the H-1B that you need to keep in mind is your startup and you must have an employer-employee relationship. That means someone at your startup, such as a co-founder, must have the ability to hire you, supervise you, hold you accountable for poor job performance, and fire you, according to the terms and conditions of the H-1B.</p>
<p>Also, you may need to work with a corporate attorney to draft certain bylaws, and it can be helpful if you personally own less than 50 percent of your startup. All of these things depend on the specific details of your situation, so definitely talk to experienced attorneys to guide you through, step by step!</p>

<h2>Salary requirement</h2>
<p>Your position and your startup must meet other requirements for an H-1B. To qualify for an H-1B, the future position must meet the definition of a “specialty occupation.” That means your position requires theoretical and practical application of highly specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>It also means you must have at least a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in a field that’s directly related to the position.</p>
<p>Moreover, your startup must be able to pay you the prevailing wage for the position and for the location where your startup or the position is based. Prevailing wages, which are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, are broken down into four levels based on experience, with Level I being an entry-level position and Level IV being the most experienced.</p>
<p>Before filing an H-1B petition on your behalf to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), your startup’s immigration attorney will have to first submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) for certification by the Labor Department of Labor. An LCA seeks to ensure that the wages and working conditions of American workers are not negatively impacted by an H-1B position.</p>
<p>Equity in a company and stock options are not considered wages in the H-1B context. Therefore, your startup will need to show that it can afford to pay you the prevailing wage as well as support business operations.</p>
<p>If you’re pre-revenue, this can be shown by a business plan plus your bank statements showing your runway from an initial investment. The amounts required depend on the details of your company’s situation.</p>
<h2>Other things to keep in mind</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions on the number of hours an individual on an H-1B must work. An H-1B position can be full-time or part-time or involve working just a few hours a week. Take a listen to my podcast on best practices for submitting <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">a strong H-1B petition</a>.</p>
<p>Concurrent H-1B employment can last as long as the original H-1B with your large tech employer. If you want to remain permanently in the United States, you or one of the companies sponsoring your H-1B should apply for a green card at least a year before your sixth year on the H-1B. (If you apply for a green card before your sixth year on an H-1B, the sponsoring employer can continue to extend your H-1B beyond six years until you receive your green card so you don’t have to leave the United States to apply at a U.S. embassy in your home country).</p>
<p>If you want to apply for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">green card on your own</a>, consider the EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability or the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for individuals with exceptional ability.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">employment-based green cards</a>, such as the EB-2 green card for professionals holding advanced degrees and EB-3 for skilled workers and professionals, require an employer to sponsor you as well as the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent">PERM</a> process, which can be challenging if you own substantial equity in the company.</p>
<p>Check with your current employer to find out if the company is willing to sponsor you for a green card. Depending on the timing, you might be able to bypass a second H-1B completely, avoiding the employer-employee relationship restrictions with your startup venture.</p>
<p>The work permit that comes in the I-485 adjustment of status process is unrestricted as to the type of employment in which you can engage!</p>
<p>Wishing you the best on your journey,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.timescale.com/">Timescale</a>, makers of the open source TimescaleDB time series database, announced a $40 million Series B financing round today. The investment comes just over two years after it got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/timescale-announces-15m-investment-and-new-enterprise-version-of-timescaledb/">a $15 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Redpoint Ventures led today&#8217;s round with help from existing investors Benchmark, New Enterprise Associates, Icon Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures. The company reports it has now raised approximately $70 million.</p>
<p>TimescaleDB lets users measure data across a time dimension, so anything that would change over time. &#8220;What we found is we need a purpose-built database for it to handle scalability, reliability and performance, and we like to think of ourselves as the category-defining relational database for time series,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ajay Kulkarni explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that the choice to build their database on top of Postgres when it launched 4 years ago was a key decision. &#8220;There are a few different databases that are designed for time series, but we&#8217;re the only one where developers get the purpose-built time series database plus a complete Postgres database all in one…,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While the company has an open source version, last year it decided rather than selling an enterprise version (as it had been), it was going to include all of that functionality in the free version of the product and place a bet entirely on the cloud for revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided that we&#8217;re going to make a bold bet on the cloud. We think cloud is where the future of database adoption is, and so in the last year, [&#8230;] we made all of our enterprise features free. If you want to test it yourself, you get the whole thing, but if you want a managed service, then we&#8217;re available to run it for you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The community approach is working to attract users, with over 2 million monthly active databases, some of which the company is betting will convert to the cloud service over time. Timescale is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/21/timescale-db/">based in New York City</a>, but it&#8217;s a truly remote organization with 60 employees spread across 20 countries and every continent except Antarctica.</p>
<p>He says that as a global company, it creates new dimensions of diversity and different ways of thinking about it. &#8220;I think one thing that is actually kind of an interesting challenge for us is what does D&amp;I mean in a totally global org. A lot of people focus on diversity and inclusion within the U.S., but we think we&#8217;re doing better than most tech companies in terms of racial diversity, gender diversity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And being remote first isn&#8217;t going to change even when we get past the pandemic. &#8220;I think it may not work for every business, but I think like being remote first has been a real good thing for us,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s content decision review body, a quasi-external panel that&#8217;s been likened to a &#8216;Supreme Court of Facebook&#8217; but isn&#8217;t staffed by sitting judges, can&#8217;t be truly independent of the tech giant which funds it, has no legal legitimacy or democratic accountability, and goes by the much duller official title &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; (aka the FOB) &#8212; has just made the biggest call of its short life&#8230;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel has voted against reinstating former U.S. president Donald Trump&#8217;s Facebook account.</p>
<p>However it has sought to row the company back from an &#8216;indefinite&#8217; ban &#8212; finding fault with its decision to impose an indefinite restriction, rather than issue a more standard penalty (such as a penalty strike or permanent account closure).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/226612455899839-oversight-board-upholds-former-president-trump-s-suspension-finds-facebook-failed-to-impose-proper-penalty/">press release</a> announcing its decision the board writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">Given the seriousness of the violations and the ongoing risk of violence, Facebook was justified in suspending Mr. Trump’s accounts on January 6 and extending that suspension on January 7.</span></p>
<p class="_8gu_ _8-v2"><span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an ‘indefinite’ suspension.</span></p>
<p class="_8gu_ _8-v2"><span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The board wants Facebook to revision its decision on Trump&#8217;s account within six months &#8212; and &#8220;decide the appropriate penalty&#8221;. So it appears to have succeeded in&#8230; kicking the can down the road.</p>
<p>During a press conference, the FOB&#8217;s co-chairs Michael McConnell and Helle Thorning-Schmidt and its director of admin, Thomas Hughes, discussed the ruling and the process undertaken to reach it &#8212; which was a majority decision, with some minority opinions included in the <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ">full decision</a> published today.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The FOB confirmed that while it agrees Facebook had sufficient justification to suspend Trump&#8217;s account on January 7 (and to remove posts that violated its policies against praise for violent acts), it believes the tech giant imposed an improper penalty which was not in line with its own rules.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its requirement is that Facebook revisit the case, with the board essentially encouraging it to take a full six months to deliberate, and then either restore Trump&#8217;s account, make the ban permanent or define a suspension for a set period of time, in line with its rules.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The opinion stresses that Facebook&#8217;s own policies do not authorize an indefinite suspension,&#8221; said McConnell during a call with reporters, emphasizing that the company&#8217;s own policies don&#8217;t allow for such a &#8216;fence-sitting&#8217; restriction and noting too that internationally recognized principles of freedom of expression &#8220;maintain that restrictions on speech must be clearly stated understandable&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency and transparency,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board&#8217;s role is to ensure that Facebook&#8217;s rules and processes are consistent with its content policies, its values and respect human rights. In applying an indeterminate and standard-less penalty and then referring the case to the board to resolve Facebook actually shirked its responsibilities,&#8221; said Thorning-Schmidt. &#8220;The board insists that Facebook apply and justify a clear penalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also went through a long list of policy recommendations the FOB is making alongside the Trump decision &#8212; such as that when it imposes a ban on an influential user it should assess the risk of inciting harm before the suspension period ends and that influential users who still pose a risk of harm should not be reinstated &#8212; suggesting that if Facebook takes its recommendations on board it will have a much easier time making a decision on Trump at the second pass.</p>
<p>The seven policy recommendations also include the suggestion that Facebook publish a new policy to govern its response to crisis situations and set limits on its discretion &#8212; including a requirement to review its own decision within a fixed time.</p>
<p>The board also wants Facebook to conduct a review of the role its platform played in contributing to a narrative of election fraud and publish the report, she said.</p>
<p>Facebook is not bound by FOB policy recommendations. But it is bound by individual case decisions and has seven days to implement them (although, in this case, it&#8217;s a bit of a meaningless deadline &#8212; but presumably Facebook will need to begin its review of Trump&#8217;s suspension within a week).</p>
<p>Thorning-Schmidt said the policy recommendations build on what she called &#8220;a pattern of recommendations&#8221; it has issued in other cases this year that she said &#8220;called out shortcomings in Facebook&#8217;s content policies and called for far greater transparency from the company&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision made by the Oversight Board today illustrates, in my view, exactly why independent oversight matters. Anyone who is concerned about Facebook&#8217;s excessive concentration of power should welcome the Oversight Board clearly telling Facebook that they cannot invent new, unwritten rules when it suits them,&#8221; she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board&#8217;s purpose is to shift Facebook from an arbitrary approach to content moderation to one where Facebook&#8217;s rules are clear, transparent and treat all users fairly. This is important not just for users in the United States but users all over the world, including the countless political leaders, campaigners and dissidents around the world who depend on Facebook to engage with communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked during a Q&amp;A session with journalists, the FOB was asked whether it wasn&#8217;t itself shirking its responsibility by bouncing a decision on Trump right back to Facebook. But Thorning-Schmidt denied it was passing the buck &#8212; arguing it&#8217;s given the company clarity on the steps it needs to take to move past the current impasse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board has made a clear decision. Facebook&#8217;s initial suspension of president Trump was correct. That&#8217;s very clear. But also we&#8217;re saying that an indefinite ban was not acceptable &#8212; and the reason why is because Facebook actually failed to follow its own rules on removing harmful content by choosing an indefinite suspension,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to point out that this is perhaps more a decision that concerns Facebook and its users, rather than Trump. Because what we&#8217;re basically saying is that it can&#8217;t be left up to Facebook to just choose their own penalty for users &#8212; they have to follow their own rules. If users have to follow the community standards and the values of Facebook and Instagram, Facebook has to do the same. So we&#8217;re basically saying that all users are equal and that Facebook also has an obligation towards the community standards &#8212; and that is to follow their own rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>McConnell confirmed that Facebook&#8217;s second decision on Trump could be appealed or referred back to the board again &#8212; extending the uncertainty around the future of the former U.S. president&#8217;s Facebook deplatforming for (potentially) even longer than six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a substantial possibility [the board will be asked to decide Trump&#8217;s case again in future],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Facebook follows our recommendations and does what we&#8217;re hoping&#8230; this time the decision will be deliberate, it will be in accordance with Facebook&#8217;s rules, it will be clearly explained, it will be on the basis of actual findings about severity of the conduct and the possibility of likelihood of future harm &#8212; and, at that point, our expectation and hope is that it will be a much easier matter because Facebook will have done what it should have done the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to emphasize that this is not the only case in which Facebook has engaged in ad-hoc-ery,&#8221; he added. &#8220;As we see so many &#8212; we&#8217;ve gotten over 20,000 appeals from users &#8212; who are frustrated at not knowing what the rules were, not knowing why Facebook took the decision it took. A kind of bewildering mess. And I believe that the very existence of an independent oversight board is designed to change the culture of content moderation on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Facebook knows that there is someone looking over their shoulder and insisting upon clarity, transparency, consistency, fairness, then it is &#8212; I think &#8212; much more likely that we&#8217;ll be seeing some internal reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook has responded briefly to the board&#8217;s ruling, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump/">writing</a> that it welcomes the panel&#8217;s upholding of its decision to ban Trump.</p>
<p>It added that it will now consider the requirement to re-examine the penalty it imposed and &#8220;determine an action that is clear and proportionate&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, Mr. Trump’s accounts remain suspended,&#8221; Facebook added.</p>
<p><em>This story is developing&#8230; refresh for updates&#8230;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly been a very quiet five months on mainstream social media since Trump had his social media ALL CAPS megaphone unceremoniously shut down in the wake of his supporters&#8217; violent storming of the capital.</p>
<p>For more on the background to Trump&#8217;s deplatforming do make time for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/">this excellent explainer</a> by TechCrunch&#8217;s Taylor Hatmaker. But the short version is that Trump finally appeared to have torched the last of his social media rule-breaking chances after he succeeded in fomenting an actual insurrection on U.S. soil on January 6. Doing so with the help of the massive, mainstream social media platforms whose community standards don&#8217;t, as a rule, give a thumbs up to violent insurrection&#8230;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;For Trump and Facebook, judgment day is around the corner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/embed/#?secret=tNhUHVSW7T" data-secret="tNhUHVSW7T" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the platforms <em>had</em> given Trump a pass for years, letting him bully, abuse and spread hate, <em>and</em> amplify and launder disinformation about anything he didn&#8217;t agree with &#8212; including his presidential rival, Joe Biden. And later the election itself (which, for the record, Trump lost and Biden won but you&#8217;d never know it if your &#8216;touchstone of truth&#8217; was the self-pity-prism of Trump&#8217;s reality-denying tweets.)</p>
<p>January 6&#8217;s chaos and violence shouldn&#8217;t have been a shock to anyone, given that Trump playbook has always been to say the quiet part out loud &#8212; frequently in ALL CAPS on the most mainstream social media platforms. But these tech giants made like they were shocked anyway, and suddenly sprung into action &#8212; finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">suspending Trump en masse</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter, a long time Trump apologist &#8212; whose platform happened to garner massive global attention by merit of being Trump&#8217;s antisocial megaphone &#8212; announced he was banned for good. (It has recently been surveying users for views on its policies toward world leaders and got nearly 49,000 people responding to its call for feedback &#8212; but has yet to announce any next steps or policy changes.)</p>
<p>Facebook also banned Trump, initially for &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">at least two weeks</a>&#8221; &#8212; and then &#8220;indefinitely&#8221;. But it quickly threw a curve ball, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">saying it would refer this &#8216;indefinite&#8217; ban to the FOB</a> &#8212; outsourcing the possibility of a Trump Second Act on its platform, if its hand-picked &#8216;external experts&#8217; decided to make it so, neatly deflecting flak from its decision to ban Trump in the process.</p>
<p>The homebrew review body had only started accepting cases in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/">October 2020</a> &#8212; delivering its first batch of content review decisions in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/">January</a>.</p>
<p>This has been quotidian work down in Facebook&#8217;s content review trenches (nipples; nazis; lots of hate speech) that could hardly prepare the still-bedding-in FOB for making an irrevocable call on Trump.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a prefiguring of today&#8217;s indecisive FOB ruling, board member Alan Rusbridger appeared to chafe at the Manichean division available to it &#8212; to unban or not to unban &#8212; by hankering, during a House of Lords testimony in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">March</a>, for the equivalent of a soccer-style &#8216;yellow&#8217; card option (so that &#8220;if you didn’t want to ban somebody for life but you wanted to have a ‘sin bin’ so that if they misbehaved you could chuck them back off again&#8221;, as he put it). But the Board&#8217;s rules and bylaws have been prewritten by Facebook.</p>
<p>The weeks rolled on and after being swamped with responses to its call for public feedback the FOB opted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/facebooks-decision-review-body-to-take-weeks-longer-over-trump-ban-call/">give itself a bit more time</a> to decide Trump&#8217;s case &#8212; doubtlessly feeling the glare of global significance.</p>
<p>Among those petitioning very publicly for Trump to stay banned from Facebook are Facebook&#8217;s former CSO, Alex Stamos, and Facebook&#8217;s current VP of spin, the former deputy prime minister of the U.K., <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/referring-trump-suspension-to-oversight-board/">Nick Clegg</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe our decision was necessary and right,&#8221; the latter wrote in January vis-a-vis the Trump ban &#8212; before &#8216;cheersing&#8217; a pint of homebrew self-review Kool Aid by adding glibly: &#8220;Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roster of civil society organizations urging that Trump <em>not</em> get back the keys to Facebook&#8217;s eyeball kingdom is as predictably long as Trump was relentlessly loud when he was allowed to SHOUT on social media.</p>
<p>But in the wake of the former president&#8217;s big tech deplatforming, a number of politicians outside the U.S. did a verbal equivalent of that shivery thing when you feel like someone is walking over your grave &#8212; expressing misgivings that tech giants could just deCAPSitate an actual president.</p>
<p>Some did also seize the moment to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">press the case for platform regulation</a> too, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lynk.global/">Lynk</a> announced today that its “knowledge-as-a-service” platform will be integrated into <a href="https://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a>’ investment process. The collaboration means the banking giant’s research analysts and institutional clients, including hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, will have access to Lynk’s database of 840,000 experts around the world.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Lynk has raised a total of $30 million in funding, including a $24 million round announced in January that was led by Brewer Lane Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, with participation from the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. The startup has offices in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Shanghai and Toronto, and serves about 200 enterprise clients, including Fortune 500 corporations, investment firms and government agencies.</p>

<p>UBS&#8217;s global research analysts now have access to Lynk’s database of experts, while UBS Global Markets will introduce the startup’s solutions to its institutional clients.</p>
<p>Lynk’s technology uses machine learning algorithms to match clients with experts in its database. Lynk’s experts cover a wide range of industries and sectors and include C-suite executives, independent consultants, lawyers, engineers, financial analysts and scientists. The platform also has collaboration tools, so teams can automatically transcribe question-and-answer sessions, search transcripts and share notes.</p>
<p>“Our platform capabilities, the scope and depth of our network and our customer service that’s paired with technology is really quite synergistic with how UBS is looking at their business,” Lynk co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy Choi told TechCrunch. “They have demonstrated a very strong innovation track record in the equity research space, so this is a great extension to their suite of offerings.”</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Lynk’s clients in the investment sector have used it to perform research and due diligence on potential investments remotely, which Choi expects to continue even after travel picks up again.</p>
<p>“Relying on on-the-ground experts, working with them to verify assumptions and develop convictions before making an investment is a must,” said Choi. “We’re really seeing a structural change and that is also what UBS is hearing from its customers.”</p>
<p>In press statement, UBS Global Head of Research Dan Dowd said, “We are proud of our innovation track record and are highly focused on helping investors get to the crux of key investment debates as rapidly as possible. Showcasing Lynk’s technology and expertise has the potential to substantially accelerate the investment processes of our clients.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About 180 million people globally suffer from infertility. In the United States, <a href="https://www.fertilityanswers.com/13-stats-know-infertility/#:~:text=The%20natural%20fertility%20rate%20is,will%20have%20to%20try%20again">one in eight </a>families have trouble conceiving. The statistics are only getting worse, as male infertility and miscarriages continue to increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alifehealth.com/">Alife Health</a>, a San Francisco-based startup founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paxton-maeder-york-00108736">Paxton Maeder-York</a>, thinks it can help. The startup wants to use artificial intelligence to increase fertility outcomes. Specifically, it wants to optimize in vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment that requires a series of expensive and emotionally-taxing procedures with varied success rates.</p>
<p>Founded last year, the startup just raised a $9.5 million seed round, led by Lux Capital. Other investment firms include Amplo, IA Ventures and Springbank Collective as well as angel investors such as Anne Wojcicki, the founder and CEO of 23andMe, Fred Moll, the founder of Intuitive Surgical and Auris, and Amira Yahyaoui, the founder of Mos and Sequoia Scout.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I personally believe that improving the quality of care through personalized treatments and reducing costs by increasing the success outcome rate can be incredibly impactful here, not just for the broader population but also specifically for minority groups,” Maeder-York said.</p>
<p>The founder began his career building surgical robots to fight lung cancer at Auris Health which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2019. Now, he’s onto finding a way to help physicians and patients go through the process of IVF.</p>
<h2><strong>FYI, IVF</strong></h2>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, takes on average<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ivf-treatment-costs-guide.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20N.C.S.L.%2C%20the,Clinics%20define%20an%20I.V.F"> three to six</a> cycles to get pregnant, and each cycle can cost between $10,000 to $20,000 in the United States. Every woman who goes through the process has to be injected with hormones weekly or biweekly &#8211; and even then, success is varied. And beyond steep costs and a long process, anyone who goes through the IVF process often has to endure the emotional toll.</p>
<p>Alife Health could alleviate some uncertainty around the complex process if it succeeds.</p>
<p>Currently, there are startups that focus on disrupting IVF <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/fertility-startup-carrot-raises-3-6-million-to-make-ivf-and-egg-freezing-more-affordable/">from its cost </a>to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mate-fertility-is-aiming-to-create-a-franchise-of-fertility-clinics-open-to-everyone/"> its accessibility</a>. Maeder-York thinks that there is no single point solution that can fix the process, so he wants to optimize each part, step by step, from education and awareness, and clinical workflows to the actual embryo selection.</p>
<p>While Alife Health’s long-term goal is to use AI in all aspects of the IVF process, at this point, the technology is only used in one step for Alife Health: the embryo selection process.</p>
<p>Alife Health plans to begin its AI-powered IVF solution through embryo selection. During IVF, future parents might create multiple embryos. It’s then on the doctor to look at that embryo image through a microscope and figure out which is most likely to survive, taking into account patient information.</p>
<p>Alife Health is inserting machine learning based on a massive set of historical data it has aggregated, into the embryo selection equation. Maeder-York said that they plan to use data to understand what the “optimal order of transfer is” and then improve chances of a pregnancy, so people don’t have to go through IVF for the third or fourth time.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s been trained on thousands and thousands of images, knowing that this image and this patient turned into a successful pregnancy, “he said. Once machine learning finds a pattern it can move forward with a recommendation and help future parents prioritize which embryos to transfer.</p>
<h2><strong>Pandemic baby</strong></h2>
<p>Alife Health is not alone. Two other startups,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/this-startup-says-its-ai-can-better-spot-a-healthy-embryo-and-improve-ivf-success/">Embryonic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/fertility-startup-mojo-wants-to-take-the-trial-and-error-out-of-ivf/">Mojo</a>, claim they have the AI needed to spot a healthy embryo and improve IVF success.</p>
<p>Israel-based Embryonic is in the early stages of its business and has minimal efficacy proof at this point. Mojo uses microscopy hardware and AI software to focus on sperm counts and then better pick strong sperm for the IVF. Internally testing of Mojo Pro shows that the system is 97% accurate compared to manual sperm counting.</p>
<p>Alife Health is a hardware agnostic program so unlike Mojo, for example, a provider doesn’t need to use or buy a special microscope to use its product.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a>, partner at Lux Capital, is joining Alife Health’s board as part of the translation. Shakir said she spent over a year meeting with the team and other IVF-focused startups to develop her thesis before eventually cutting a check. She pointed out a number of reasons that Alife Health stood out to her, primarily its focus on an end-to-end solution at the IVF process, but also its clinician-friendly approach.</p>
<p>“Other kludgey solutions require additional interfaces, hardware, [and] time,” she said. “Clinicians don&#8217;t have an appetite for that in their daily workflows. It needs to be intuitive.”</p>

<p>Along with being a software-only solution, Alife Health sees part of its competitive edge as its partnerships with clinics. It has spent years cultivating a network of IVF clinics &#8211; and their data on prior cases, treatments and outcomes &#8211; to get a representative set that could be used to help any person receiving IVF treatment, it says.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, women have been consistently underrepresented in research and minority women, black women have been incredibly underrepresented in research,” Maeder-York said. “The fact that our data set is so well stratified and representative of these groups means that when we [see] a patient of one off these minority groups, we’re going to be in a really unique position to give them answers and personalized care.”</p>
<p>Alife Health declined to release information about the efficacy of its AI, and it is still yet to get regulatory approval. Fittingly, millions of dollars should help it get to this next, and crucial phase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://bitso.com/">Bitso</a>, a regulated crypto exchange in Latin America, announced today it has raised $250 million in a Series C round of funding that values the company at $2.2 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiger Global and Coatue co-led the round, which also included participation from Paradigm, BOND &amp; Valor Capital Group and existing backers QED, Pantera Capital and Kaszek.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The news caught our attention for several reasons. For one, it comes just four months after the startup raised $62 million in a Series B round. Secondly, the company believes the funding makes it the most valuable crypto platform in Latin America. And lastly, it also makes the company one of the most highly valued fintechs in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Last year was a good one for Bitso, which says it processed more than $1.2 billion in international payments &#8212; including remittances and payments between companies &#8212; during 2020 alone. Bitso says it also has surpassed 2 million users. These two milestones, the company argues, is evidence of the growing use of crypto as an everyday financial tool in the region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Demand for crypto assets and crypto-enabled financial products have soared in popularity both for individuals and businesses in the region, according to Bitso, which aims to be “the safest, most transparent, and only regulatory compliant platform” in Latin America. The company also says it’s the only player in the region to offer crypto-insurance for its client&#8217;s funds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With investors expecting a Latin American cryptocurrency boom, Mexico&#8217;s Bitso raises $62 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/embed/#?secret=chCpdGxxYu" data-secret="chCpdGxxYu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The growth of the crypto ecosystem this year has been remarkable. It took Bitso six years to get its first million clients. Now — less than 10 months later — we have reached the 2 million mark,” said Bitso co-founder and CEO Daniel Vogel. But the metrics he is most proud of are that Bitso has also more than doubled the assets on its platform in the last five months and that its transacting volume during the 2021 first quarter exceeded the transaction volume it did in all of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso was founded in January 2014 and acquired its first customer in April of that year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s mission, put simply, is to build next-generation borderless financial services for consumers and businesses alike. “Cryptocurrencies are the future of finance and Bitso makes the future available today,” the company says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitso offers products and services for individuals and businesses to use crypto in their everyday life,” Vogel said. “In some parts of the world, crypto is associated with speculation. Bitso’s customers rely on the technology for everyday uses from receiving remittances to engaging in international commerce.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitso says its “global-minded” product offerings fit the needs of local customers in Mexico, Argentina and now Brazil, where it just launched its retail operations. The company plans to use its new capital toward broadening its capabilities and product offering. It also plans to expand its operations in other Latin American countries in the coming months. In January, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia announced Bitso as one of the authorized companies in its Sandbox and crypto pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso&#8217;s upcoming products include a crypto derivatives platform and interest bearing accounts for crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a pivotal moment for the future of finance in Latin America,” Vogel told TechCrunch. “We see a significant amount of traditional financial infrastructure in the region being replaced by crypto. We plan to use this funding to continue that trend by expanding our product offering for individuals and businesses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Naturally, Bitso&#8217;s investors are bullish on the company’s potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">QED Investors co-founder and managing partner Nigel Morris admits that in the past he was “a crypto denier.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For the longest time, we didn&#8217;t see a way [that] crypto fit [into our portfolio]. It wasn&#8217;t clear until recently that the use cases for crypto expanded much beyond speculative trading. There are now a whole series of conventional banking products that we can wrap around it,” Morris told TechCrunch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s mission, he said, is to “make crypto useful” and QED believes the company is succeeding at doing just that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Daniel and the entire Bitso team is passionate about taking the mystique out of crypto. Crypto is not going away; it’s going to be here for the future,” Morris said. “By sitting at the intersection of crypto and traditional financial institutions, Bitso has a promise to provide lower-cost, friction-free financial services to entire populations of individuals who otherwise would be excluded &#8212; a laudable and unique mission indeed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso, he added, is learning from the crypto experience in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not making the same mistakes and leaning into the emerging regulatory landscape has been a competitive advantage to Bitso&#8217;s success in Mexico,” Morris said. “As Bitso grows throughout the regions, they certainly have a leg up and might even leapfrog crypto adoption in the U.S.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Crypto is rapidly gaining adoption in Latin America,” said Tiger Global Partner Scott Shleifer, in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with Bitso and believe they have the right team and platform to increase share in this growing market.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2014, Bitso has more than 300 employees across 25 different countries. That compares to 116 employees last year at this time. In particular, its growth in Brazil is increasing exponentially.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve gone from 1 to 26 Bitsonauts already based in Brazil, with many more working from abroad, and plan to 3X our number of hires in Brazil by the end of the year,” Vogel said, who acknowledged that the pandemic really impacted his company via the shift to remote work. “As we expand our reach into new territories, it has become a lot easier to meet staffing needs when the requirements are based on knowledge over geography.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s leadership is mostly based in Mexico, but the company also has offices in Buenos Aires, São Paolo and Gibraltar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Halfway through my Monday afternoon workout last week, I got a message from a security researcher with a screenshot of my Peloton account data.</p>
<p>My Peloton profile is set to private and my friend&#8217;s list is deliberately zero, so nobody can view my profile, age, city, or workout history. But a bug allowed anyone to pull users&#8217; private account data directly from Peloton&#8217;s servers, even with their profile set to private.</p>
<p>Peloton, the at-home fitness brand synonymous with its indoor stationary bike and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">beleaguered treadmills</a>, has more than three million subscribers. Even President Biden is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/biden-peloton.html">said to own one</a>. The exercise bike alone costs upwards of $1,800, but anyone can sign up for a monthly subscription to join a broad variety of classes.</p>
<p>As Biden was inaugurated (and his Peloton moved to the White House — <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/a35190713/joe-biden-peloton-white-house-security-risk/">assuming the Secret Service let him</a>), Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found he could make unauthenticated requests to Peloton&#8217;s API for user account data without it checking to make sure the person was allowed to request it. (An API allows two things to talk to each other over the internet, like a Peloton bike and the company&#8217;s servers storing user data.)</p>
<p>But the exposed API let him — and anyone else on the internet — access a Peloton user&#8217;s age, gender, city, weight, workout statistics, and if it was the user&#8217;s birthday, details that are hidden when users&#8217; profile pages are set to private.</p>
<p>Masters reported the leaky API to Peloton on January 20 with a 90-day deadline to fix the bug, the standard window time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public.</p>
<p>But that deadline came and went, the bug wasn&#8217;t fixed, and Masters hadn&#8217;t heard back from the company, aside from an initial email acknowledging receipt of the bug report. Instead, Peloton only restricted access to its API to its members. But that just meant anyone could sign up with a monthly membership and get access to the API again.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted Peloton after the deadline lapsed to ask why the vulnerability report had been ignored, and Peloton confirmed yesterday that it had fixed the vulnerability. (TechCrunch held this story until the bug was fixed in order to prevent misuse.)</p>
<p>Peloton spokesperson Amelise Lane provided the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a priority for Peloton to keep our platform secure and we’re always looking to improve our approach and process for working with the external security community. Through our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program, a security researcher informed us that he was able to access our API and see information that’s available on a Peloton profile. We took action, and addressed the issues based on his initial submissions, but we were slow to update the researcher about our remediation efforts. Going forward, we will do better to work collaboratively with the security research community and respond more promptly when vulnerabilities are reported. We want to thank Ken Munro for submitting his reports through our CVD program and for being open to working with us to resolve these issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Masters has since put up <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">a blog post</a> explaining the vulnerabilities in more detail.</p>
<p>Munro, who founded Pen Test Partners, told TechCrunch: &#8220;Peloton had a bit of a fail in responding to the vulnerability report, but after a nudge in the right direction, took appropriate action. A vulnerability disclosure program isn’t just a page on a website; it requires coordinated action across the organisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But questions remain for Peloton. When asked repeatedly, the company declined to say why it had not responded to Masters&#8217; vulnerability report. It&#8217;s also not known if anyone maliciously exploited the vulnerabilities, such as mass-scraping account data.</p>
<p>Facebook, LinkedIn, and Clubhouse have all <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">fallen victim to scraping attacks</a> that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms. But Peloton declined to confirm if it had logs to rule out any malicious exploitation of its leaky API.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">Disqus</a>, a commenting plugin that&#8217;s used by a number of news websites and which can share user data for ad targeting purposes, has got into hot water in Norway for tracking users without their consent.</p>
<p>The local data protection agency said today it has <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intent-to-issue--25-million-fine-to-disqus-inc/">notified</a> the U.S.-based company of an intent to fine it €2.5 million (~$3M) for failures to comply with requirements in Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on accountability, lawfulness and transparency.</p>
<p>Disqus&#8217; parent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">Zeta Global</a>, has been contacted for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Datatilsynet said it acted following a 2019 investigation in Norway&#8217;s national press &#8212; which found that default settings buried in the Disqus&#8217; plug-in opted sites into sharing user data on millions of users in markets including the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Uncovering the Disqus data machine: <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@disqus</a> shared the personal data of tens of millions of users without them or the websites knowing about it. thread &#8211; 1/13 <a href="https://t.co/bLW4Gl2Rhf">pic.twitter.com/bLW4Gl2Rhf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Martin Gundersen (@martingund) <a href="https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And while in most of Europe the company was found to have applied an opt-in to gather consent from users to be tracked &#8212; likely in order to avoid trouble with the GDPR &#8212; it appears to have been unaware that the regulation applies in Norway.</p>
<p>Norway is not a member of the European Union but is in the European Economic Area &#8212; which adopted the GDPR in July 2018, slightly after it came into force elsewhere in the EU. (Norway transposed the regulation into national law also in July 2018.)</p>
<p>The Norwegian DPA writes that Disqus&#8217; unlawful data-sharing has &#8220;predominantly been an issue in Norway&#8221; &#8212; and says that seven websites are affected: NRK.no/ytring, P3.no, tv.2.no/broom, khrono.no, adressa.no, rights.no and document.no.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disqus has argued that their practices could be based on the legitimate interest balancing test as a lawful basis, despite the company being unaware that the GDPR applied to data subjects in Norway,&#8221; the DPA&#8217;s director-general, Bjørn Erik Thon, goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our investigation so far, we believe that Disqus could not rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for tracking across websites, services or devices, profiling and disclosure of personal data for marketing purposes, and that this type of tracking would require consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our preliminary conclusion is that Disqus has processed personal data unlawfully. However, our investigation also discovered serious issues regarding transparency and accountability,&#8221; Thon added.</p>
<p>The DPA said the infringements are serious and have affected &#8220;several hundred thousands of individuals&#8221;, adding that the affected personal data &#8220;are highly private and may relate to minors or reveal political opinions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tracking, profiling and disclosure of data was invasive and nontransparent,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The DPA has given Disqus until May 31 to comment on the findings ahead of issuing a fine decision.</p>

<h3>Publishers reminded of their responsibility</h3>
<p>Datatilsynet has also fired a warning shot at local publishers who were using the Disqus platform &#8212; pointing out that website owners &#8220;are also responsible under the GDPR for which third parties they allow on their websites&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, in other words, even if you didn&#8217;t know about a default data-sharing setting that&#8217;s not an excuse because it&#8217;s your legal responsibility to know what any code you put on your website is doing with user data.</p>
<p>The DPA adds that &#8220;in the present case&#8221; it has focused the investigation on Disqus &#8212; providing publishers with an opportunity to get their houses in order ahead of any future checks it might make.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s DPA also has some admirably plain language to explain the &#8220;serious&#8221; problem of profiling people without their consent. &#8220;Hidden tracking and profiling is very invasive,&#8221; says Thon. &#8220;Without information that someone is using our personal data, we lose the opportunity to exercise our rights to access, and to object to the use of our personal data for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;An aggravating circumstance is that disclosure of personal data for programmatic advertising entails a high risk that individuals will lose control over who processes their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out, the issue of adtech industry tracking and GDPR compliance has become a major headache for DPAs across Europe &#8212; which have been repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">slammed for failing to enforce the law in this area</a> since GDPR came into application in May 2018.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example (which transposed the GDPR before Brexit so still has an equivalent data protection framework <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">for now</a>), the ICO has been investigating GDPR complaints against real-time bidding&#8217;s (RTB) use of personal data to run behavioral ads for <em>years</em> &#8212; yet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">hasn&#8217;t issued a single fine or order</a>, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">warning the industry that it&#8217;s acting unlawfully</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator is now being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">sued</a> by complainants over its inaction.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC, meanwhile &#8212; which is the lead DPA for a swathe of adtech giants which site their regional HQ in the country &#8212; has a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">open GDPR investigations</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/adtech-veteran-quantcast-is-latest-tech-giant-to-face-gdpr-privacy-probe/">into adtech</a> (including RTB). But has also failed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">issue any decisions in this area</a> almost three years after the regulation begun being applied.</p>
<p>Its lack of action on adtech complaints has contributed significantly to <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/max-schrems-and-helen-dixon-clash-over-irish-gdpr-enforcement-on-big-tech-40363344.html">rising domestic (and international) pressure</a> on its GDPR enforcement record more generally, including from the European Commission. (And it&#8217;s notable that the latter&#8217;s most recent legislative proposals in the digital arena include provisions that seek to avoid the risk of similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">enforcement bottlenecks</a>.)</p>
<p>The story on adtech and the GDPR looks a little different in Belgium, though, where the DPA appears to be inching toward a major slap-down of current adtech practices.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">A preliminary report last year</a> by its investigatory division called into question the legal standard of the consents being gathered via a flagship industry framework, designed by the IAB Europe. This so-called &#8216;Transparency and Consent&#8217; framework (TCF) was found not to comply with the GDPR&#8217;s principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, or the lawfulness of processing.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected on that case this year &#8212; but if the DPA upholds the division&#8217;s findings it could deal a massive blow to the behavioral ad industry&#8217;s ability to track and target Europeans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With cybercrime on course to be a <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/annual-cybercrime-report-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 trillion problem</a> this year, organizations are throwing ever more resources at the issue to avoid being a target. Now, a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help them stress-test the investments that they have made into their security IT is announcing some funding on the back of strong demand from the market for its tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://cymulate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cymulate</a>, which lets organizations and their partners run machine-based attack simulations on their networks to determine vulnerabilities and then automatically receive guidance around how to fix what is not working well enough, has picked up $45 million, funding that the startup &#8212; co-headquartered in Israel and New York &#8212; will be using to continue investing in its platform and to ramp up its operations after doubling its revenues last year on the back of a customer list that now numbers 300 large enterprises and mid-market companies, including the Euronext stock exchange network as well as service providers such as NTT and Telit.</p>
<p>London-based One Peak Partners is leading this Series C, with previous investors Susquehanna Growth Equity (SGE), Vertex Ventures Israel, Vertex Growth and Dell Technologies Capital also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Eyal Wachsman, the CEO and co-founder, Cymulate&#8217;s technology has been built not just to improve an organization&#8217;s security, but an automated, machine-learning-based system to better understand how to get the most out of the security investments that have already been made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to be the largest cybersecurity &#8216;consulting firm&#8217; without consultants,&#8221; he joked.</p>
<p>The valuation is not being disclosed but as some measure of what is going on, David Klein, managing partner at One Peak, said in an interview that that he expects Cymulate to hit a $1 billion valuation within two years at the rate it&#8217;s growing and bringing in revenue right now. The startup has now raised $71 million, so it&#8217;s likely the valuation is in the mid-hundreds of millions. (We&#8217;ll continue trying to get a better number to have a more specific data point here.)</p>
<p>Cymulate &#8212; pronounced &#8220;sigh-mulate&#8221;, like the &#8220;cy&#8221; in &#8220;cyber&#8221; and a pun of &#8220;simulate&#8221;) is cloud-based but works across both cloud and on-premises environments and the idea is that it complements work done by (human) security teams both inside and outside of an organization, as well as the security IT investments &#8212; in terms of software or hardware) that they have already made.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not replace &#8212; we bring back the power of the expert by validating security controls and checking whether everything is working correctly to optimize a company&#8217;s security posture,&#8221; Wachsman said. &#8220;Most of the time, we find our customers are using only 20% of the capabilities that they have. The main idea is that we have become a standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tools are based in part on the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a>, a knowledge base of threats, tactics and techniques used by a number of other cybersecurity services, including a number of others building continuous validation services that compete with Cymulate. These include the likes of FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/randori-introduces-red-team-attack-platform-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randori</a>, Khosla-backed <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2019/05/attackiq-raises-17-6m-in-series-b-financing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AttackIQ</a> and many more.</p>
<p>Although Cymulate is optimized to help customers better use the security tools they already have, it is not meant to replace other security apps, Wachsman noted, even if the by-product might become buying less of those apps in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe my message every day when talking with security experts is to stop buying more security products,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;They won’t help defend you from the next attack. You can use what you&#8217;ve already purchased as long as you configure it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his words, Cymulate acts as a &#8220;black box&#8221; on the network, where it integrates with security and other software (it can also work without integrating but integrations allow for a deeper analysis). After running its simulations, it produces a map of the network and its threat profile, an executive summary of the situation that can be presented to management and a more technical rundown, which includes recommendations for mitigations and remediations.</p>
<p>Alongside validating and optimising existing security apps and identifying vulnerabilities in the network, Cymulate also has built special tools to fit different kinds of use cases that are particularly relevant to how businesses are operation today. They include evaluating remote working deployments, the state of a network following an M&amp;A process, the security landscape of an organization that links up with third parties in supply chain arrangements, how well an organization&#8217;s security architecture is meeting (or potentially conflicting) with privacy and other kinds of regulatory compliance requirements, and it has built a &#8220;purple team&#8221; deployment, where in cases where security teams do not have the resources for running separate &#8220;red teams&#8221; to stress test something, blue teams at the organization can use Cymulate to build a machine learning-based &#8220;team&#8221; to do this.</p>
<p>The fact that Cymulate has built the infrastructure to run all of these processes speaks to a lot of potential of what more it could build, especially as our threat landscape, and how we do business, both continue to evolve. Even as it is, though, opportunity today is a massive one, with Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimating</a> that some $170 billion will be spent on information security by enterprises in 2022. That&#8217;s one reason why investors are here, too.</p>
<p>“The increasing pace of global cyber security attacks has resulted in a crisis of trust in the security posture of enterprises and a realization that security testing needs to be continuous as opposed to periodic, particularly in the context of an ever-changing IT infrastructure and rapidly evolving threats. Companies understand that implementing security solutions is not enough to guarantee protection against cyber threats and need to regain control,” said Klein, in a statement. &#8220;We expect Cymulate to grow very fast,&#8221; he told me more directly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was way back in 2018 that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/appyling-ai-to-insurance-documents-omnius-raises-its-first-series-a-funding/">Omni:us appeared to disrupt</a> the insurance market by applying AI to this most legacy of all industries. It has now gone on to raise $44.1 million. In a similar vein, <a href="https://www.shift-technology.com/">Shift Technology</a> in France has raised $100 million.</p>
<p>Now a UK startup aims to do something similar, but this time it will be coming out of the key market of the UK, where the insurance industry is enormous.</p>
<p>Sprout.ai is an insurtech startup that use AI to help instance companies to settle claims within 24 hours. It&#8217;s now raised £8m/$11m Series A round led by Octopus Ventures. The round was joined by existing investors, Amadeus Capital Partners, Playfair Capital and Techstars. It was Seed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/sprout-ai/">funded</a> buy Amadeus in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sprout.ai supplies global insurers, such as Zurich, with a product that applies NLP and OCR to insurance claims (which might involve such as handwritten doctors’ notes for instance) to enable them to be resolved faster, in not a dissimilar fashion to Omni:us and SHift. Sprout.ai  says it now has deployments in Europe, South America and APAC.</p>
<p>Niels Thoné, CEO of Sprout.ai, said in a statement: “Sprout.ai’s mission is to revolutionize customer service within global claims automation. Our innovative and industry-leading AI claims engine is poised to solve the current market inefficiencies, allowing insurers to focus on customers in their moments of need.”</p>
<p>Nick Sando, early-stage fintech investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “We are often at our most vulnerable when we submit insurance claims, and it doesn’t help when we then have to wait another month for it to be processed. Sprout.ai empowers insurers to process claims in a fraction of the time, creating much better outcomes for customers when they need it most.”</p>
<p>As we can see, the market is hotting up for this kind of service, so it will be interesting see if these startups end up &#8216;land-locked&#8217; to their language markets or not. Certainly, I can see M&amp;A opportunities for whoever starts to lead the pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Motors is beefing up its executive and technical leadership team, hiring people from Waymo, Intel and Xperi as it prepares to become a publicly listed company. The automaker said Wednesday that Sherry House, who formerly worked at Waymo, will be its new chief financial officer.</p>
<p>House was at Waymo for four years, most recently as its as treasurer and head of investor relations. Prior to Waymo, she was vice president of corporate development at Visteon Corporation and managing director of technology, media and telecom at Deloitte Corporate Finance.</p>
<p>The electric vehicle automaker has also named Margaret Burgraff, who previously held positions at Apple and Intel, as vice president of software validation, Sanjay Chandra as vice president of Information Technology, and Jeff Curry as vice president of marketing and communications. Burgraff most recently served as vice president of global developer relations at Intel, where she was responsible for co-engineering and enabling global independent software vendors to work with Intel&#8217;s product portfolio. She was also a partner at Continuous Ventures, a global venture capital and private equity firm that primarily supports tech startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra left his position as chief information officer and head of cloud of operations at TiVo/Xperi to join Lucid. He also worked a PayPal, Virgin Mobile and Workday. Curry most recently held a chief marketing level position at the Jaguar brand and had stints at Ferrari and Audi. Curry has also held marketing positions outside of automotive, including a vp-level at SiriusXM. He is the founding partner of brand strategy consultancy Mere Mortals.</p>
<p>The new hires comes just weeks before Lucid&#8217;s merger with special acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp. is expected to close, which officially make it a publicly traded company. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied pro-forma equity value at $24 billion. </span>The private investment and cash from Churchill will provide roughly $4.4 billion in total funding to Lucid.</p>
<p>The public listing will provide Lucid the capital it needs to begin production of its first all-electric vehicle, the luxury Lucid Air. The company had originally intended to start production and the first deliveries in this spring, but pushed the date to the second half of the year. The Air will first come to North America, followed by Europe in 2022 and China in 2023.</p>
<p>Lucid is also aiming to bring a second vehicle, this time a performance luxury SUV called Gravity, to market in North America in 2023. The vehicles will be produced at its new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lucid-motors-completes-700m-factory-to-produce-its-first-electric-vehicles/">initial phase of the $700 million factory</a> was completed late last year and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 vehicles a year. Eventually, Lucid plans to expand the factory over another three phases to reach a production capacity of 365,000 units per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a>, one of the 10 African startups from the recent Y Combinator winter batch, has bagged an impressive pre-seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two months after graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five-month-old company, which helps consumers and businesses manage e-commerce and fulfillment operations &#8212;  from warehousing and logistics to delivery and cash collection &#8212; has closed a $3.25 million pre-seed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands, this is a record high for the MENA region, which also had a record-high two months ago in fellow Egyptian and YC winter batch startup Dayra</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fintech company raised $3 million in debt and equity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-mossaad-50903438">Mohamed Mossaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enas-siam-18150115/">Enas Siam</a> founded <a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a> in September 2020. However, the company didn&#8217;t launch until January 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/flextock-is-a-yc-backed-e-commerce-fulfillment-provider-for-africa-and-the-middle-east/">covered the company in March</a>, it had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $850,000 but CEO Mossaad made it clear that more was still to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in this round include Egyptian VC Foundation Ventures, Y Combinator, MSA Capital, CRE Ventures, Alter Global, Jameel Investment Management Company (JIMCO)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, B&amp;Y Ventures Partners and Access Bridge Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also received angel investments from an unnamed Sequoia Capital scout, investors in the GCC region and Flexport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock currently serves the Egyptian market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It leverages proprietary software to offer merchants end-to-end e-commerce fulfillment and logistics solutions on demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since its launch, the company claims to have signed more than 100 merchants to its platform, with thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). The company also says it is growing 25% week-on-week. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last two months we launched different products to help merchants grow their brands more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Mossaad told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; We&#8217;ve built various partnerships with different logistics services providers in the market to offer merchants an E2E experience, quadrupled the number of merchants and doubled the size of our team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock wants to capture a large </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of MENA&#8217;s $25 billion e-commerce logistics market, and Mossaad says the funding will help with that ambition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to put the funding into strengthening its presence in Egypt, technology, recruitment and regional expansion before the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the MENA region, Trella is another Egyptian logistics company backed by YC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator has now invested in four logistics and digital freight focused startups, including Nigeria&#8217;s Kobo and SEND, ever since it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> backed Flexport in 2014</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having a global operation, the freight forwarder is testing the waters in the MENA region &#8212; on the Flexport website, there&#8217;s a role for a Partnerships Manager, Turkey &amp; Middle East. Although Flexport has freight forwarding and custom partners in the region, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its interest in deepening reach in MENA might have spurred it to examine other opportunities. Flextock which provides e-commerce fulfillment appears to be one following the global freight provider&#8217;s &#8220;strategic investment&#8221; in the Egyptian company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Mossaad said that having Flexport onboard not only serves as a strong vote of confidence to the company&#8217;s growth potential but will help it build a regional interconnected network of e-commerce logistics services providers by leveraging their wide network of partners around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it will be interesting to see how this investment plays out in the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mazen Nadim, the managing partner at Foundation Ventures, Flextock&#8217;s e-commerce fulfillment and logistics play will be key to realizing the regional dominance it craves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize the massive opportunity in logistics presented by the rise of e-commerce in the region,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flextock is building the underlying infrastructure so that any e-commerce player can scale their operations on-demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock&#8217;s investment continues the series of seven-figure pre-seed rounds that have become more prevalent in the African tech scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No less than six startups (including Flextock) have raised $1 million or more in this round in the past year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include Egypt&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedny,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cassbana and Flick; and Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a>, with the latter raising the largest pre-seed investment yet in Africa at $3.4 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More money for the edtech boom: Munich-based <a href="https://www.studysmarter.de/en/">StudySmarter</a>, which makes digital tools to help learners of all ages swat up &#8212; styling itself as a &#8216;lifelong learning platform&#8217; &#8212; has closed a $15 million Series A.</p>
<p>The round is led by sector-focused VC fund, Owl Ventures. New York-based Left Lane Capital is co-investing, along with Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen (ex WhatsApp, Uber and Dropbox; now GP at Balderton Capital), and existing early stage investor Dieter von Holtzbrinck Ventures (aka DvH Ventures).</p>
<p>The platform, which launched back in 2018 and has amassed a user-base of 1.5M+ learners &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">with a 50/50 split between higher education students and K12 learners, and with main markets so far in German speaking DACH countries in Europe </span>&#8212; uses AI technologies like natural language processing (NLP) to automate the creation of text-based interactive custom courses and track learners&#8217; progress (including by creating a personalized study plan that adjusts as they go along).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StudySmarter claims its data shows that 94% of learners achieve better grades as a result of using its platform.</p>
<p>While NLP is generally most advanced for the English language, the startup says it&#8217;s confident its NLP models can be transferred to new languages without requiring new training data &#8212; claiming its tech is &#8220;scalable in any language&#8221;. (Although it concedes its algorithms increase in accuracy for a given language as users upload more content so the software itself is undertaking a learning journey and will necessarily be at a different point on the learning curve depending on the source content.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how StudySmarter works: Users input their study goals to get recommendations for relevant revision content that&#8217;s been made available to the platform&#8217;s community.</p>
<p>They can also contribute content themselves to create custom courses by uploading assets like lecture slides and revisions notes. StudySmarter&#8217;s platform can then turn this source material into interactive study aids &#8212; like flashcards and revision exercises &#8212; and the startup touts the convenience of the approach, saying it enables students to manage all their revision in one place (rather than wrangling multiple learning apps).</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s both a (revision) content marketplace <em>and</em> a productivity platform for learning &#8212; as it helps users create their own study (or lesson) plans, and offers them handy tools like a digital magic marker that automatically turns highlighted text into flashcards, while the resulting &#8220;smart&#8221; flashcards also apply the principle of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/yak-tack-is-a-super-simple-app-to-boost-vocabulary/">spaced repetition learning</a> to help make the studied content stick.</p>
<p>Users can choose to share content they create with other learners in the StudySmarter community (or not). The startup says a quarter (<span style="font-weight: 400;">25%) of its users are creators, and that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the content they create is shared. </span>Overall, it says its platform provides access to more than 25 million pieces of shared content currently.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s topic agnostic, as you&#8217;d expect, so course content covers a diverse range of subjects. We&#8217;re told the most popular courses to study are: Economics, Medicine, Law, Computer Science, Engineering and school subjects such as Maths, Physics, Biology and English.</p>
<p>Regardless of how learners use it, the platform uses AI to nudge users towards relevant revision content and topics (and study groups) to keep extending and supporting their learning process &#8212; making adaptive, ongoing recommendations for other stuff they should check out.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ease of creating learning materials on the StudySmarter platform results in a democratization of high-quality educational content, driven by learners themselves,&#8221; is the claim.   </span></p>
<p>As well as user generated content (UGC), StudySmarter&#8217;s platform hosts content created by verified educationists and publishers &#8212; and there&#8217;s an option for users to search only for such verified content, i.e. if they don&#8217;t want to dip into the UGC pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, there is no single workflow,&#8221; says co-founder and CMO Maurice Khudhir. &#8220;We created <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> to adapt to different learner types. Some are very active learners and prefer to create content, some only want to search and consume content from other peers/publishers.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our platform focuses on the art of learning itself, rather than being bound by topics, sectors, industries or content types. This means that anyone, regardless of what they’re learning, can use StudySmarter to improve how they learn. We started in higher education as it was the closest, most relevant market to where we were at the time of launch. We more recently expanded to K12, and are currently running our first corporate learning pilot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Gamification is a key strategy to encourage engagement and advance learning, with the platform dishing out encouraging words and emoji, plus rewards like badges and achievements based on the individual&#8217;s progress. Think of it as akin to Duolingo-style microlearning &#8212; but where users get to choose the subject (not just the language) and can feed in source material if they wish.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Duolingo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/embed/#?secret=lejQl2O6jP" data-secret="lejQl2O6jP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>StudySmarter says it&#8217;s taken inspiration from tech darlings like Netflix and Tinder &#8212; baking in recommendation algorithms to surface relevant study content for users -(a la Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;watch next&#8217; suggestions), and deploying a Tinder-swipe-style learning UI on mobile so that its &#8220;smart flashcards&#8221; can to adapt to users&#8217; responses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Firstly, we individualise the learning experience by recommending appropriate content to the learner, depending on their demographics, demands and <span class="il">study</span> goals,&#8221; explains Khudhir. &#8220;For instance, when an economics student uploads a PDF on the topic of marginal cost, <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> will recommend several user-generated courses that cover marginal cost and/or several flashcards on marginal cost as well as e-books on <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> that cover this topic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;In this way, <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> is similar to Netflix &#8212; Netflix will suggest similar TV shows and films depending on what you’ve already watched and <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> will recommend different learning materials depending on the types of content and topics you interact with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;As well, depending on how the student likes to learn, we also individualise the learning journey through things such as the smart flashcard learning algorithm. This is based on spaced repetition. For example, if a student is testing themselves on microeconomics, the flashcard set will go through different questions and responses and the student can swipe through the flashcards, in a similar way to Tinder. The flashcards’ sequence will adapt after every response.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The notifications are also personalised &#8212; so they will remind the student to learn at particular points in the day, adapted to how the student uses the app.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There&#8217;s also a scan functionality which uses OCR (optical character recognition) technology that lets users upload (paper-based) notes, handouts or books &#8212; and a sketch feature lets them carry out further edits, if they want to add more notes and scribbles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once ingested into the platform, this scanned (paper-based) content can of course also be used to create digital learning materials &#8212; extending the utility of the source material by plugging it into the platform&#8217;s creation and tracking capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A significant cohort of users access <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> on tablets, and they find this learning flow very useful, especially for our school-age pupils,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>StudySmarter can also offer educators and publishers detailed learning analytics, per Khudhir &#8212; who says its overarching goal is to establish itself as &#8220;the leading marketplace for educational content&#8221;, i.e. by using the information it gleans on users&#8217; learning goals to directly recommend (relevant) professional content &#8212; &#8220;making it an extremely effective distribution platform&#8221;, as he puts it.</p>
<p>In addition to students, he says the platform is being used by <span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers, professors, trainers, and corporate members &#8212; ie. to create content to share with their own students, team members, course participants etc, or just to publish publicly. And h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e notes a bit of a usage spike from teachers in March last year as the pandemic shut down schools in Europe. </span></p>

<p>What about copyright? Khudir says they follow a three-layered system to minimize infringement risks &#8212; firstly by not letting users share or export any professional content hosted on the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Uploaded documents like lecture notes and users&#8217; own comments can be shared within one university course/class in a private learning group. But only UGC (like flashcards, summaries and exercises) can be shared freely with the entire <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> community, if the user wants to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It’s important to note that no content is shared without the author’s permission,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We also have a contact email for people to raise potential copyright infringements. Thanks to this system, we can say that we never had a single copyright issue with universities, professors or publishers.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another potential pitfall around UGC is quality. And, clearly, no student wants to waste their time revising from poor (or just plain wrong) revision notes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">StudySmarter says it&#8217;s limiting that risk by tracking how learners engage with shared content on the platform &#8212; in order to create quality scores for UGC &#8212; monitoring factors like how often such stuff is used for learning; how often the students who study from it answer questions correctly; and by looking the average learning time for a particular flashcard or summary, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We combine this with an active feedback system from the students to assign each piece of content a dynamic quality score. The higher the score is, the more often it is shown to new users. If the score falls below a certain threshold, the content is removed and is only visible to the original creator,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We track the quality of shared content on the creator level so users who consistently share low-quality content can be banned from sharing more content on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are unlikely to be quality issues with verified educator/publisher content. But since it&#8217;s professional content, StudySmarter can&#8217;t expect to get it purely for free &#8212; so it says it &#8220;mostly&#8221; follows revenue-sharing agreements with these types of contributors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is also sharing data on learning trends and to help publishers reach relevant learners, as mentioned above. So the information it can provide education publishers about potential customers is probably the bigger carrot for pulling them in.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are very happy to say that the vast majority of our content is not created or shared on </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">StudySmarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for any financial incentive but rather because our platform and technology simply make the creation significantly easier,&#8221; says Khudir, adding: &#8220;We have not paid a single Euro to any user on </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">StudySmarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to create content and do not intend to do so going forward.&#8221; </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s still early days for monetization, which he says isn&#8217;t front of mind yet &#8212; with the team focused on building out the platform&#8217;s global reach &#8212; but he notes that the model allows for a number of b2b <span style="font-weight: 400;">revenue streams, adding that t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey&#8217;ve been doing some early b2b monetization by working with employers and businesses to promote their graduate programs or to support recruitment drives. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The new funding will be put towards <span style="font-weight: 400;">product development and supporting the platform&#8217;s global expansion, per <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Khudir</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve run successful pilots in the U.K. and U.S. so they’re our primary focus to expand to by Q3 this year. In fact, following a test pilot in the U.K. in December, we became the number one education app within 24 hours (ahead of the likes of Duolingo, Quizlet, Kahoot, and Photomath), which bodes well!&#8221; he goes on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brazil, India and Indonesia are key targets for us due to a wider need for digital education. We’re also looking to launch in France, Nordics, Spain, Russia and many more countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the fact our platform is content-agnostic, and the technology that underpins it is universal, we’re able to scale effectively in multiple countries and languages. Within the next 12 months, we will be expanding to more than 12 countries and support millions of learners globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>StudySmarter&#8217;s subject-agnostic, feature-packed, one-stop-shop platform approach sets it apart from what <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Khudir</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> refers to</span></span> as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">single-feature apps&#8221;, i.e. which just help you learn one thing &#8212; be that Duolingo (only languages), or apps that focus on teaching a particular skill-set (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/math-learning-app-photomath-raises-23-million-as-it-reaches-220-million-downloads/">Photomath</a> for maths equations, or dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/yc-backed-py-is-a-duolingo-style-learn-to-code-app/">learn-to-code</a> apps/courses (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gift-guide-22-stem-toy-gift-ideas-for-every-little-builder/">toys</a>)). </span></p>
<p>But where the process of learning is concerned, there are lots of ways of going about it, and no one that suits everyone (or every subject), so there&#8217;s undoubtedly room for (and value in) a variety of approaches (which may happily operate in parallel). So it seems a safe bet that broad-brush learning platforms aren&#8217;t going to replace specialized tools &#8212; or (indeed) vice versa.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StudySmarter names the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">Course Hero</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/studocu">StuDocu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic/">Quizlet</a> and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> as taking a similar broad approach &#8212; while simultaneously claiming they&#8217;re not doing it in &#8220;quite the same, holistic, end-to-end, all-in-one bespoke platform for learners&#8221; way.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albeit, some of those edtech rivals are doing it with a lot more capital already raised. So StudySmarter is going to need to work smart and hard to localize and grab students&#8217; attention as it guns for growth far beyond its European base.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s insurance market stands at a 3% penetration rate, per a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Middle%20East%20and%20Africa/Africas%20insurance%20market%20is%20set%20for%20takeoff/SVGZ-AfricaInsurance-Ex1.svgz">McKinsey study</a> in 2018 comparing six insurance regions on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the South African market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this number drops to a measly 1.12%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other parts of the world, most African insurance providers neglect the importance of tailored and affordable insurance products to the average African consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.lami.world/">Lami Technologies</a>, a startup out of Kenya armed with $1.8 million in seed money, is looking to change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><a href="https://www.accion.org/how-we-work/invest/accion-venture-lab"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Venture Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a seed-stage investment firm that supports financial services targeted at underserved markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other VCs that participated include AAIC, Consonance, P1 Ventures, Acuity Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners and Future Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low insurance uptake in Africa is somewhat due to the traditional distribution of insurance policies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rely on brick-and-mortar channels to sell and process policies. This takes a long processing cycle and has poor customer satisfaction and higher distribution costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ways premiums </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is affected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From the McKinsey report in 2018, the total gross written premiums (GWP) in Eastern Africa was $3.3 billion. In comparison, South Africa did $48.3 billion worth of GWP that same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, CEO <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/jihan-abass-09b609125">Jihan Abass</a> founded the company in 2018 to democratize insurance products in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, the main problem we wanted to solve was that 97% of Africans don&#8217;t buy insurance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were trying to understand the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind that, especially in Kenya where there are over 50 insurance companies but the penetration level is 2.4%,&#8221; she told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kenyan insurtech startup Pula raises $6M Series A to derisk smallholder farmers across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/kenyan-insurtech-startup-pula-raises-6m-series-a-led-by-tlcom-capital/embed/#?secret=DAEcVJg4bk" data-secret="DAEcVJg4bk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The driving force for us was making insurance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We felt that building the technological infrastructure to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the distribution of insurance was the best way to increase the penetration level in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But selling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consumers would be a meticulous process as they rarely buy insurance from trusted organizations, let alone a third-party company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Lami adopted a B2B2C approach to leverage the trust already built by platforms that converse with customers daily and innovate around it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an API, it allows businesses like banks, startups, and organizations to offer digital insurance products to their users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The product can also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some customers like Stanbic Bank in Kenya use Lami&#8217;s API to run insurance operations; HR platform WorkPay makes insurance products available to the businesses using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With over 20 insurance writers, the company is also launching an insurance marketplace on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">e-commerce platform Jumia</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can get a quote for motor, medical or other tailored insurance products through its API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also can customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them, get their policy documents and access claims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it takes about 90 days for claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be processed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an average African insurer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abass said Lami has reduced this to a week &#8212; it is one way the three-year-old company has developed trust with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147706" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147706" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="Jihan Abbas - Founder &amp; CEO of Lami" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147706" class="wp-caption-text">Jihan Abbas (Founder &amp; CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that Lami has been able to overcome is getting insurance companies onboard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, transitioning from a traditional way of offering insurance to digital distribution channels only worked because Lami began to show early the value of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer experience and journey which requires getting the right insurance to the right customer at the right time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what makes Lami stand out, Abass continued. It co-designs products with its underwriting partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And approaching design in this manner helps the businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She illustrates an offering with a bus-booking platform where passengers&#8217; insurance points </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are calculated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a per-trip basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It counts when they board the bus and stops when they alight. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She believes an innovative process like this will take the continent&#8217;s insurance play to a more desirable place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s huge potential in the insurance industry. Despite the low penetration, the annual market is worth more than $60 billion a year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people are starting to open their eyes to insurance as opposed to other financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer and Madison Insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These underwriters help distribute more than 30 products from medical and employee benefits to motor and device insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami will use the seed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hire more people, improve its technology and grow its presence across Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Venture Lab is placing a bet on Lami&#8217;s embedded finance play. Here&#8217;s what its African director, Ashley Lewis said of the investment. “&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By embedding customized insurance within businesses that customers know and trust, Lami is making insurance accessible for underserved populations in Africa and enabling them to build financial resilience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami&#8217;s investment also represents a spark in a Kenyan tech ecosystem where being both an indigenous and female founder is an incongruous mix</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.timoncapital.com/african-startup-compensation-survey">study</a> in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that Kenya had the strongest presence of expat co-founders of any of the Big Four tech ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the country has a better female co-founder representation than other countries (1 in 4), the percentage of those from Kenya is about 12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a handful of female founders who have raised million-dollar rounds. Though Abass sits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comfortably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this illustrious club, it took thick skins and confidence in her product to get in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The funding landscape in Kenya is generally biased towards male founders and in East Africa, especially to foreign founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it was a lot harder to get investors excited and onboard with us. For us, we&#8217;ve built something quite exciting, although it took some time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key thing why we wanted to make this publicized is so other female founders can see that there&#8217;s an opportunity to do the same too,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; she said.</span></p>
