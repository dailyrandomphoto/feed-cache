										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.wunderite.com/">Wunderite</a>, a Boston-based software startup, announced that it has raised $3 million in an early-stage round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Wunderite builds and sells software designed to help insurance agencies more rapidly process insurance applications, and automate some of their processes. With an industry-focus on insurance agencies while providing some API hooks, the startup fits into a number of startup trends, including vertical SaaS, developer-friendly tooling, and insurtech.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petemacdonald">Peter MacDonald</a> (CEO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephschnare/">Joe Schnare</a> (COO) about their company and its new investment. MacDonald previously worked for his family&#8217;s insurance business, while Schnare earned insurance experience by working for a large player in the market. The two met while at business school.</p>
<p>The pair told TechCrunch that most property and casualty insurance (car, pet, home, and other forms of popular coverage) is still sold by small and mid-sized agencies. That may surprise, but most of the United States is not the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, or Seattle it turns out.</p>
<p>But while that market share point is good news for smaller insurance groups out there, it&#8217;s not great news for the staff of those firms as MacDonald and Schnare detailed that many are forced to work with archaic tooling. Like writing with their hands. Or email. A huge market &#8212; insurance is a monster industry &#8212; with a piecemeal competitive market and antiquated tooling could prove ripe for Wunderite, provided that it can reach a sufficient number of the companies that it hopes will comprise its revenue base.</p>
<p>Spark Capital&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/team-profiles/alex-finkelstein">Alex Finkelstein</a> is bullish on the company&#8217;s chances. In a conversation with TechCrunch concerning the round, he expressed an interest in what he called &#8220;unsexy&#8221; business categories that feature extensive fragmentation and either outdated software, or no software at all. That is precisely Wunderite&#8217;s thesis.</p>
<p>Finkelstein thinks that such companies can build workflow tooling, grow themselves into being the data hub of their industry customers, leveraging that perch into an even larger enterprise. So he has big hopes for startup past its current product remit.</p>
<p>Today the startup is just seven folks &#8212; four in the United States, three in the Philippines &#8212; but expects to grow to 15 to 20 this year.</p>
<p>Finally, why did the company raise $3 million in a market when it seems that every round is ten times the size it might have been three years ago? The founders said that they are at the &#8220;early stages&#8221; of product-market fit, so they want to start building their sales team without overspending. Asked the same question, Finkelstein said that the company had outlined a series of milestones that it wants to meet, and that $3 million was the number it needed to reach them. At which point it can raise more capital at a higher valuation.</p>
<p>Wunderite &#8212; a portmanteau of the German word &#8220;wonder,&#8221; which means wonder or miracle, and &#8220;underwrite,&#8221; which is English for taking on risk in exchange for a fee &#8212; has the funds it needs to stretch its sales legs a bit and put more revenue points on the board. Let&#8217;s see how well it can scales its revenue operation with its new capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few months, PayPal has been quietly gearing up for its expansion in China.</p>
<p>At the recent Boao Forum for Asia, China&#8217;s answer to Davos, the American payments giant <a href="http://www.hinews.cn/news/system/2021/04/18/032541194.shtml">said</a> its strategy for China is not to challenge the duopoly of Alipay and WeChat Pay. Instead, it wants to focus on cross-border business and provide gateways both for Chinese merchants to collect funds and for Chinese consumers to pay for overseas goods.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a lucrative area. The market size of cross-border e-commerce in China surged from about 3 trillion yuan ($460 million) to nearly 6 trillion yuan between 2016 and 2021, according to market research firm <a href="http://report.iresearch.cn/wx/report.aspx?id=3661">iResearch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But this space has also become crowded in recent years and PayPal may be late to the fray, said a China-based manager for an American tech giant, who asked for anonymity because he&#8217;s not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>On Amazon, one of the largest marketplaces for Chinese exporters to sell online, there are already established options for merchants to collect funds. Setting up a bank account in a foreign country can be difficult for a small-time Chinese exporter, not to mention the high fees for remittance, so such merchants often seek third-party payments transfer solutions such as U.S.-based Payoneer and Chinese equivalents <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pingpong">Pingpong</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lianlian-pay">Lianlian</a>, which charge a relatively small fee to deposit merchants&#8217; sales into their bank accounts at home.</p>
<p>China has stringent policies for foreign exchange and electronic payments, but PayPal has already cleared the regulatory hurdles. In January, the American fintech titan became the first foreign firm to hold a license for online payment processor in China after it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-paypal-stake/paypal-becomes-first-foreign-firm-in-china-with-full-ownership-of-payments-business-idUKKBN29J0IC">bought out shares in a local payments firm</a>.</p>
<p>Obtaining the government greenlight is just the first step. The appeal of PayPal hinges largely on what it can offer to Chinese e-commerce exporters, who are now flooding the likes of Amazon and eBay.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, customers only care which service is the cheapest and easiest to use,&#8221; said the China-based manager from the American firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese cross-border payment solutions have achieved impressive results in terms of products, scale, and fees,&#8221; the person said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think PayPal stands a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exporters who build their own online stores instead of selling on mainstream marketplaces may still find PayPal necessary as a tool to accept payments from customers, given the app&#8217;s wide reach.</p>
<p>As for cross-border payments, PayPal is competing with Tencent&#8217;s WeChat Pay and Ant Group&#8217;s Alipay, which have long been ubiquitous in China. Both e-wallets have been aggressively growing their global partnerships to let China&#8217;s outbound travelers pay at overseas retailers like they would at home. Those shopping for overseas products domestically often use Chinese-owned e-commerce apps, which tend to have Alipay or WeChat Pay as their payment processor. Credit cards never became prevalent in China.</p>
<p>Cross-border payments have also become one of Ant&#8217;s main growth goals, according to the <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/1026/2020102600165.pdf">prospectus</a> of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">now-halted initial public offering</a>. While overseas businesses accounted for just about 5% of the firm&#8217;s revenue in the second half of 2020, most of that segment came from cross-border payments. At the time, Ant also had plans to spend HK$52.8 billion, or 40%, of the net proceeds from its IPO on expanding its cross-border payment and merchant services as well as other overseas functionalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on whether PayPal is able to offer even lower fees than Ant,&#8221; said a person who previously worked on cross-border wallets for a Chinese company. &#8220;But PayPal itself is not famous for low fees.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sos-accessoire.com/">SOS Accessoire</a>, a French startup that helps people diagnose and repair their home appliances, has raised €10M/$12M in a funding round led by ETF Partners. The round was joined by Quadia, Starquest, and Seed for Good.</p>
<p>There is now a growing home repair market, powered by startups like this, which allow people to save money, but also reduce waste, and ultimately help the environment.</p>
<p>Around 80% of home appliances get replaced instead of repaired, creating an enormous environmental problem. At the same time, says SOS Accessoire, the spare parts market is worth €4.1bn in the European Union alone. So why not tap into that consumer desire? Why indeed not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, sourcing spare parts is not easy, there are hundreds of suppliers, and instructions are aimed at professionals, not amateur repairers.</p>
<p>SOS Accessoire provides tools to diagnose home appliance problems, access spare parts, and provides video tutorials for the repair process.</p>
<p>The company says it estimates it has now saved half a million appliances in 2020, equivalent to 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, or the annual equivalent of CO2 emissions from 4,375 French people a year.</p>
<p>Olivier de Montlivault, the founder of SOS Accessoire, said: “We have a huge opportunity to help reduce household appliance waste and, in doing so, disrupt the perceived thinking that once something is broken, it must be replaced.”</p>
<p>Its direct competitors are other digital players focusing on the retail customer such as Spareka and Adepem. But SOS Accessoire says its competitive advantages include its size, availability of spare parts and catalog/database.</p>
<p>Remy de Tonnac, a partner at ETF Partners, said: “We’re seeing an increasingly conscious consumer wanting to maintain their appliances, rather than just throw them away. SOS Accessoire is ideally placed to meet that need, with a management team that has a deep understanding of the  market and the business model to not only dominate this niche within the e-commerce sector but disrupt the broader market itself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Ivorian e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.afrikrea.com/en">Afrikrea</a> started as a marketplace for African-based and inspired clothing, accessories, arts, and crafts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, Afrikrea has served more than 7,000 sellers from 47 African countries and buyers from 170 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the company&#8217;s data, it records more than 500,000 visits monthly, with the majority of its customers from Europe and North America recording over $15 million in transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Afrikrea presents African merchants to showcase and sell their products to the world, it is just one of the many channels available, including personal websites and social media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moulaye-taboure-78280041/">Moulaye Taboure</a> says that he noticed that merchants were splitting time and concentration across different channels, which affected their engagement with Afrikrea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We noticed that it was getting harder for our sellers to make sales because they were losing time, money and energy switching between channels,&#8221; Taboure told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Every time they want to sell a product, they put it on social media, Afrikrea, and other websites. And when one buyer shows interest, there is no single place to track and see all the orders. That&#8217;s hard for these businesses to offer quality services and grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last year, Afrikrea began testing an all-in-one SaaS e-commerce platform for these merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is announcing its launch. The platform called ANKA will allow users to sell from Africa, ship products to anywhere in the world and get paid through local and international African payment methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce, payments and global shipping. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s ANKA&#8217;s play for thousands of micro-retailers and businesses on the continent and around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform lets users sell via an omnichannel dashboard with a single inventory, orders and messages management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Customers can carry out t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransactions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via a customized online storefront like Shopify, social media platforms, links such as on Gumroad and the Afrikrea marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants can carry out payments and payouts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via a wallet and an Afrikrea Visa card. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, which costs $12, allows customers to perform mobile money and mobile banking transactions with MPesa, Orange, MTN and PayPal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping completes the entire sales life cycle, from the point of sale to receipt of goods. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Afrikrea partnered with global logistics partner</span><a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/05006ca0a798b8b530707cf4067db5e759ed20bd?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa-eshop.dhl%2F&amp;userId=1734919&amp;signature=83e47d57b7a55579"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DHL</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to offer shipping services to its customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion is ANKA&#8217;s best-selling category </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because of its affiliation with Afrikrea. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African fashion and apparel market is <a href="https://www.euromonitor.com/apparel-and-footwear-in-2015-trends-developments-and-prospects/report">worth $31billion</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per Euromonitor, and Afrikrea estimates the yearly spend of its major markets to be worth $12.5 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown from the company puts &#8220;the African diaspora in Europe at $1 billion, those in America and the Caribbean at $9 billion and non-Africans with links to the continent at $2.5 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> general e-commerce activities on the continent,</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/lions-still-on-the-move-growth-in-africas-consumer-sector"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey &amp; Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pegs consumer spending to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. African e-commerce is also expected to account for up to 10% of retail sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Jumia, Mall4Africa and Takealot have been at the forefront of this growth over this past decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MallforAfrica struck a partnership with DHL in 2015, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/dhl-launches-africa-eshop-app-for-global-retailers-to-sell-into-africa/">launched DHL Africa eShop</a> with the logistics giant four years later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 200 sellers from the U.S. and U.K. serve African consumers in more than 30 countries on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike MallforAfrica and other e-commerce platforms, ANKA differentiates itself as a platform for export rather than import, specifically for African products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Moulaye, ANKA is currently the largest e-commerce exporter on the continent, and since its partnership with DHL, it has shipped more than 10 tons of cargo monthly from Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the biggest client of DHL exporting from Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ship 10 tons every month and have sellers in 47 African countries, with Kenya and Nigeria as our largest markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have something African that is going to a global scale. That&#8217;s one of the angles we had with Afrikrea, and we want to keep that with ANKA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets us apart is that we&#8217;re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to solve a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African problem; we want to solve a global problem for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching five years ago, Afrikrea, which Taboure launched with</span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/luc-b-perussault-diallo-99525519"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Luc B.

In this period, the company has seen its revenue grow 5x and claims to have ARR more than it has raised in its lifetime. To continue its growth efforts, Afrikrea is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concluding a Series A round later this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to make significant waves in the world of finance, with smaller outfits luring customers away from incumbents by providing an easier way for them to not only engage with basic banking services, but to tap into a wave of technology that brings more personalization and often better deals into the equation. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.vivawallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, a Greek startup building banking services aimed at small and medium merchants, has picked up financing of $80 million, money that it will be using to expand its footprint and the services that it is offering to users, in particular expanding its Merchant Advance loans business.</p>
<p>The company is already live in 23 European markets and plans soon to expand that to Croatia, Hungary and Sweden.</p>
<p>The funding is notable in part because of who is doing the investing. Tencent &#8212; the Chinese technology giant behind Wechat that is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making major inroads into financial services</a> &#8212; is in the round, alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Breyer Capital. Hedosophia, the somewhat secretive fund that also has been active in SPACs in the US, is also a backer, we have confirmed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Viva Wallet is not disclosing its valuation right now, but Yannis Larios, the company&#8217;s VP of strategy and business development, confirmed to us that it&#8217;s in the middle of closing a large Series D that will value it at €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion). This is a big leap: he also noted that when Viva Wallet closed its Series C in the second half of 2019, it was valued at €305 million.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the Series D is the same as a<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/greece-banks-vivawallet-idUSL8N2FF8G8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> €500 million ($603 million)</a> round that Reuters reported in August 2020 that Viva Wallet is raising (we have asked) to help it build out a new kind of loan book around its Merchant Advances and other loans that it provides to customers.</p>
<p>Essentially, if approved by regulators, investors would get stakes in a new legal entity, a special purpose vehicle, that will hold the loans. This is not typically how debt from loans is handled by neo-banks, but it seems that the logic is that it could give the startups more agility to scale faster by removing some of the risk from its balance sheet. (The downside: potentially less accountability around those loans?)</p>
<p>The round is notable for coming at a time when Europe is slowly, hopefully poking its head out from under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has shaken and knocked over many an economy already wobbling even before the public health crisis. Focused primarily on merchants, Viva Wallet is a prime example of the kind of tech business that might help some of these critical businesses recover.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“We are excited to onboard Tencent, EBRD and Breyer Capital to Viva Wallet,” said Haris Karonis, Founder and CEO of Viva Wallet, in a statement. “We are confident that our investors’ extensive know-how and network of partnerships will accelerate Viva Wallet’s plan to unify the fragmented European payments market. The technology innovations that we are bringing forward to European merchants will help them provide a frictionless, localised payment experience to all their clients, and liberate them from the hassle of maintaining legacy card terminals.”</span></p>
<p>If you think that the world of neo-banks is very crowded &#8212; and that specifically neo-banks focussed on the SMB opportunity is also getting crowded (some of the other contenders include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/small-business-challenger-bank-finom-raises-another-12-million-to-expand-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/wise-locks-down-5-7-million-to-scale-its-challenger-bank-designed-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a> out of the US, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/monzo-business-bank-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monzo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/penta-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starling</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/uks-anna-raises-21m-for-its-smb-focused-business-account-and-tax-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANNA</a> among many others)&#8211; one reason why Viva Wallet is getting some attention is because of its traction and track record so far.</p>
<p>Larios says that the startup has been profitable as of Q1 of this year, on the back of a business that has grown by more than 40% in the last year, with 60,000 merchants currently active on its books. It&#8217;s on track, he said, for that number to be 100,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>One reason for its success, he said, is that it&#8217;s taken a very localized approach to growth, setting up operations with physical branches in each of the countries where it is active &#8212; somewhat of a retro idea in today&#8217;s market where banks are regularly shutting down their brick-and-mortar locations and going virtual. &#8220;Viva Wallet is proving the resilience of its business model,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The funding will be used in part to build out its loans program but also to expand areas where Viva Wallet is already strong. One of these is its point of sale Tap-On-Phone solution, which turns any Android device (smartphone, tablet or enterprise device) into a card terminal, to accept both contactless and PIN payments without the need for separate hardware. (Most POS systems use small, separate terminals that will connect to a tablet or phone.)</p>
<p>He also said there will be some M&amp;A in the future to expand to more markets more quickly.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One area where the company will not expand is into the consumer space. Other neo-banks like Revolut and Atom have leveraged their traction with younger consumers to move into providing services for the enterprises that they found, but Larios that that is not a strategy that Viva Wallet will take in the reverse, not least because the consumer market has so far proven to be a tough-margin (or even bad-margin) game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Viva Wallet focuses on businesses only and will continue to do so!&#8221; he said (exclamation his!). &#8220;The consumer segment is not providing any space for profitability and we are seeing that all competing neo-bank business models focusing on consumers are mostly burning money away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are focusing on the SMEs of Europe, providing a pan-European payments solution which however is very much localized to address merchants’ true local needs in terms of local payments acceptance, local IBAN accounts, local BIN business debit cards etc.&#8221; But while Viva Wallet may have a lot of SMB customers &#8212; and the EBRD investment is definitely being made to endorse that &#8212; he points out that it also includes medium businesses and some enterprises &#8212; larger merchants like supermarket chains, for example &#8212; and that will be an area it will continue to expand in.</span></p>
<p>This gives Viva Wallet enough specialization and differentiation, alongside its profitability in targeting those areas so far, to bring in the big name investors keen to tap into economic recovery, both to help that along and to ride the wave of that as it pays dividends.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited to help Viva Wallet unify the fragmented European payments ecosystem across 23 countries. Viva Wallet is at the forefront of a paradigm shift for fintech and together, we expect to transform the payments industry in Europe” said Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tencent shares Viva Wallet&#8217;s aspirations of creating value for users and partners through innovation. We look forward to supporting Viva Wallet in its expansion across Europe,&#8221; added Danying Ma, MD of Tencent Investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.barkyn.com/">Barkyn</a>, a European subscription service for pets that combines food with tele-vet services, has raised a further €3 milion ($3.6M) from FoodTech investor <a href="https://www.fiveseasons.vc/">Five Seasons Ventures</a>, extending its previous Series A to €8M, and total funds raised to date to €10M. Five Seasons Ventures joins previous investors Indico Capital Partners, All Iron Ventures, Portugal Ventures and Shilling Capital. Barkyn is in the same space as Tails, acquired by Nestlé, and Butternut Box from the UK which has raised $28M.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, the Portuguese startup currently serves customers in Portugal, Spain and Italy, and is aiming to be a key ‘pet wellness’ brand for Southern Europe.</p>
<p>Barkyn says its subscription service offers “healthy food using fresh meat” plus a dedicated remote online veterinarian. It says personalizing the food to match the dog’s nutritional needs is part of its attraction for customers. It has also created the ‘Barkyn Complex’, a trademarked anti-inflammatory supplement for pets, plus a pet insurance product to its customers in Portugal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>André Jordão, Barkyn’s CEO and Co-Founder said in a statement: “There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to nutrition and what the body needs, and we solve this based on our knowledge, existing products and continued research and development.”</p>
<p>Barkyn is pushing at an open door. It’s widely acknowledged that during the pandemic, pet ownership has gone up across the world as people fought the lockdown blues.</p>
<p>In 2020 Barkyn says it experienced 40 percent growth each quarter across Southern Europe. </p>
<p>Commenting on the investment in Barkyn, Five Seasons’ Founding Partner Niccolo Manzoni said: “Barkyn is a unique company within Southern Europe, where the region has higher levels of pet ownership but no inspiring digital pet wellness brands. Combining personalized food with tele-vet services and, in the case of Portugal, insurance, gives customers one destination for the well-being of their pets.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Jordão said the startup had a shot at over-taking existing pet food brands because it’s “rethinking what the pet market should look like, through technology &#8211; building a pet care service and not only a pet food subscription. We’ve developed a 360 holistic experience: a subscription that aligns the best food you could ever give your dog with telemedicine. We’re able to secure a very close relationship while scaling the model.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WayaWaya&#8217;s customers and partners include the likes of I&amp;M Bank, Interswitch and MTN. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers a range of services, from digital banking and payment services to financial services APIs and payment bots</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ajua, the acquisition is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on WayaWaya&#8217;s payments bots system known as <a href="https://janja.me/">Janja</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, which has customers like Airtel, Ezee Money, Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HF Group), enables borderless banking and payments across apps and social media platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/teddy-ogallo-18211225">Teddy Ogallo</a>, the entrepreneur who founded WayaWaya, joins Ajua as VP of Product APIs and Integrations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of commerce happening on the continent and Ajua wants companies to move from transaction numbers to the customers behind such transaction,&#8221; Griffith told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Imagine if we knew what drove consumer habits for businesses. I mean, that&#8217;s a huge exponential curve for African businesses.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s SME market alone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at $220 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while businesses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big enterprises, can afford customer communication tools, a large segment of small businesses are being left out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajua&#8217;s play is to use data and analytics to connect companies with their customers in real time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken what makes enterprise customers successful, and we&#8217;re capturing it in a simple format so SMEs can have the same tools,&#8221; Griffith added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most consumer behavior for these SMEs happens offline, Ajua gives businesses unique USSD codes to receive payments, get feedback and offer discounts to their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the products Ajua has launched over the years for customer feedback at the point of service to businesses that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have over 45 million customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s partners and clients also include Coca-Cola, FBNQuest, GoodLife Pharmacy, Java House, Safaricom, Standard Chartered and Total</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an intelligent messaging bot, Janja </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> individuals and businesses across WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram to automate customer support and make cross-border payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Janja&#8217;s integration into Ajua&#8217;s product stack will close much of the acquirer&#8217;s customer experience loop by automating responses and giving customers what they want, when they want it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This acquisition comes a month after Ajua announced that it partnered with telecom operator MTN Nigeria to launch a customer management product for Nigerian businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product called <a href="https://www.mtnbusiness.com.ng/engauge">MTN EnGauge</a> carries the same features present in Ajua but, in this case, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is tailored</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses using the MTN network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The roll-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to generate more data for Ajua&#8217;s thousands of users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also be upgraded to incorporate Janja and other services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, it appears Ajua could have created a product like Janja in-house due to its vast experience in the consumer experience space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company chose an acquisition and Griffith gave two reasons why &#8212; building a similar product would have taken a long time and Ogallo seemed to know Janja&#8217;s business and operations so well, it just made sense to get him on board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teddy was going the same direction we&#8217;re going. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thought to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WayaWaya instead and make a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good company out of both products attempting to solve the same problem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To me, it&#8217;s all about solving the problem together rather than going alone,&#8221; said the CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why he accepted the acquisition, Ogallo, who now has a new role, noted that Ajua&#8217;s ability to scale customer service and experience and also help businesses was one reason and earned admiration from him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing how WayaWaya’s technology can complement Ajua’s innovative products and services, and help scale and monetize businesses, is an exciting opportunity for us, and we are happy that our teams will be collaborating to build something unique for the continent,” he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a solid infrastructure play from Ajua coming from a founder who is a massive advocate of acquisition and consolidation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith believes that the two are strategies for a speedier route to new markets and channels in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are lots of ways we can build the ecosystem. There are lots of young talent building stuff, and they don&#8217;t have access to capital to get to the next stage. The question is if they want to race to the finish line or take off time and get acquired. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a huge opportunity in Africa if you want to solve complex problems by acquisition.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been an uptick in local acquisitions in Africa from startups within a single country and between two countries in the past three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he former, Nigerian recruitment platform <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/03/jobberman-acquires-top-competitor-ngcareers-undisclosed-deal/">Jobberman&#8217;s acquisition of NGCareers</a> last year comes to mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are pan-African instances like Lagos-based hub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/nigerias-cchub-acquires-kenyas-ihub-to-create-mega-africa-incubator/">CcHub&#8217;s acquisition of iHub</a>, its Nairobi counterpart; Ethiopian software provider Apposit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/nigerias-paga-acquires-apposit-confirms-mexico-and-ethiopia-expansion/">sell-off to Nigerian fintech Paga</a>; and Johannesburg-based fintech <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/06/30/mfs-africa-beyonic-acquisition/">MFS Africa acquiring Uganda&#8217;s Beyonic</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common theme among the acquisitions (and most African acquisitions) is their undisclosed sums</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Ajua, Griffith cited regulatory issues as one reason why the company is keeping the figure under wraps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching nine years ago, Ajua has raised a total of $3.5 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/msurvey">Crunchbase</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the nature of this acquisition and partnership with MTN, the company might set sights on another fundraise to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Nigeria (a market it entered in 2019) and other African countries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic threw remote work into the spotlight, but tech companies have hired in other locations for years to deal with talent shortages. <a href="https://arc.dev/">Arc</a> announced today it is opening its remote hiring platform to all software developers. Previously, Arc was open only to developers who passed its verification process. Developers can still get verified to stand out from other applicants, but Arc’s job database and search engine is now available to everyone.</p>
<p>Arc was launched two years ago by the team behind <a href="https://www.codementor.io/">Codementor</a>, an online education platform for software developers. Since then, Arc has been used by companies like Spotify, Hims, Hubspot and FiveStars for hiring. Its investors include Techstars, 500 Startups, WI Harper and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>“As proud as we are of impact we have made for developers, we really want to scale that impact, and that’s why we decided to create a much more open product experience,” founder and chief executive officer Weiting Liu told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new version of Arc centers around two features: its smart remote job search engine and developer community. Arc crawls job boards and other sites for its database and has so far aggregated 54,000 developer openings from 13,000 companies. Then its search engine removes some of the challenges associated with searching for remote work.</p>
<p>“For example, one common complaint is that a lot of jobs are remote, but U.S. only. Or it’s only remote until the end of the pandemic,” Liu said. “Our algorithm will do its best based on your circumstances. For example, if you are a developer based in Asia or in Eastern Europe, there are certain job opportunities that are unfortunately not applicable to you based on the time zones. So we filter all of those things, and also based on your experience and tech stacks, to recommend the most relevant jobs.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The team behind Codementor launches Arc to help companies hire talented developers around the world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/the-team-behind-codementor-launches-arc-to-help-companies-find-talented-developers-around-the-world/embed/#?secret=9dinw2WfoK" data-secret="9dinw2WfoK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Arc Community is a resource for software developers who are new to remote work or want to learn about work practices in other countries. For example, “they might have questions like, should my resume be in this format for a U.S.-based employer, or what are the types of tools used and cultural norms?” Liu said. “If someone is looking for a position with an American company, we will talk about common interview practices or even basic work practices like how many companies use Slack. That’s where the community comes in and we want to enable developers who have already been working remotely to share their experiences.”</p>
<p>Even though it is now optional, Arc still recommends its verification process. It typically takes about a week, and includes a coding challenge and behavioral and technical interviews with an Arc team member. Even if someone doesn’t pass, they get feedback about where they can improve and can reapply in six months. Verification and job searches are free, and Arc monetizes by charging employers for hires through its platform.</p>

<p>In addition to its community, Arc recently launched a program called Elevate. Inspired by Liu’s experiences in Y Combinator and Techstars, Elevate is meant to be a “short-term talent accelerator” for developers who want to transition into remote work. Its first program included 13 developers from Latin America and future cohorts will range in size from 10 to 20 people. The program includes career preparation workshops, interview practice and live mentorship sessions with developers who work at GitLab, Zapier and Dialpad.</p>
<p>Arc is currently <a href="https://wefunder.com/arc">running a crowdfunding campaign</a>, started after the SEC implemented its new equity crowdfunding regulations, and has raised about $950,000 so far.</p>
<p>“This is aligned with our vision, which is about democratizing access, so if we can make Arc a partially community-owned remote job platform, it will be extremely interesting because we aspire to become the world’s largest remote job site and if we can turn our community members into investors-slash-owners of the platform, it can help us realize our mission faster,” said Liu.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Almost two centuries ago, gold prospectors in California set off one of the greatest rushes for wealth in history. Proponents of socially conscious investing claim fund managers will start a similar stampede when they discover that environmental, social and governance (ESG) insights can yield treasure in the form of alternative data that promise big payoffs &#8212; if only they knew how to mine it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			First, let’s be clear: ESG is not on the fringe.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There may be some truth to that line of thinking if you take some of the rhetoric and advertising out of the equation.</p>
<p>First, let’s be clear: ESG is not on the fringe. The European Union has implemented new financial regulations via the <a href="https://www.pwc.ch/en/publications/2020/sustainable-finance-disclosure-regulation.pdf">Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation </a>(SFDR). These improve ESG disclosures and considerations and help to direct capital toward products and companies that benefit people and the planet. As we write, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/sec-response-climate-and-esg-risks-and-opportunities">considering</a> drafting and implementation of ESG-related regulations.</p>
<p>Whether enacted or currently under consideration, these rules encourage fund managers to integrate sustainability risks into their business processes, report on them publicly, stamp out <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp#:~:text=Greenwashing%20is%20the%20process%20of,company's%20products%20are%20environmentally%20friendly.">greenwashing</a>, and promote transparency and knowledge among investors. Accordingly, it will become easier to compare firms&#8217; sustainability efforts, too, allowing stakeholders from all corners to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>Incorporating ESG factors into investment strategies is not new, of course. The world&#8217;s largest asset managers have been practicing it for years. <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/press-releases/article/90-of-sp-500-index-companies-publish-sustainability-reports-in-2019-ga-announces-in-its-latest-a.html">According</a> to the Governance &amp; Accountability Institute, 90% of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 now produce sustainability reports, an increase of 70 percentage points from more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Yet some are still groaning about adopting an ESG investing mindset; they see ESG as a nuisance that detracts from their mission of earning high returns. But could this mindset mean they are missing important opportunities?</p>
<h2>Don’t wait</h2>
<p>Waiting for new mandatory ESG reporting and compliance framework standards in the U.S. puts Americas-focused managers at a significant disadvantage. Fund managers can start gaining insights today from alternative data originating in ESG-related data stemming from climate change, natural disasters, harassment and discrimination lawsuits, and other events and information that can be mined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dutch-German growth capital firm Endeit Capital has raised a 250 million euro fund to invest in B+ stage European startups. This is its third and largest investment fund, Endeit Capital III. The firm says it plans to support European scale-up companies that “lead to an accelerated digital transformation of the European society and economy and indeed the digital maturity of Europe.”</p>
<p>Endeit was a relatively early European investor, kicking off in 2006, and investing in 35 companies. It’s previously raised and invested 250 million euro through its first two funds, in the Benelux, DACH and Nordic regions.</p>
<p>The firm previously invested in companies such as 3D Hubs, Roamler, Albelli, MetrixLab, Unamic and Eyeworks, Gastrofix, Comtravo, Contorion, Chronext, Tourradar, Smartclip, Nordics Blis, Unruly and Leadfeeder. Many of its portfolio companies have exited to firms such as Time Warner, Xerox, Newscorp, Protolabs, Lightspeed, Macromill, TMG and Cimpress. Endeit Capital’s portfolio company Bux, a Europen neo-broker, recently raised $80 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It joins a spate of recent new VC and growth funds in Europe such as new funds from Cusp Capital and Highland Europe.</p>
<p>The news is good for European later-stage companies. While European early-stage capital has been on a tear for a few years, late-stage capital in Europe is typically lacking.</p>
<p>Founder and managing partner Hubert Deitmers said: “This financing round of Fund III has been a huge success, where we could establish the fund within a short time frame in its ‘First &amp; Final close’, despite corona. It&#8217;s rewarding to see that ten entrepreneurs that Endeit had previously invested in are now investors themselves in this third fund.”</p>
<p>He says Endeit is explicitly aimed at boosting European companies against the superpowers of the US and China: “We support those internet entrepreneurs who can drive the change to make Europe more competitive and who have the ambition to become global market leaders… The next generation of European internet companies will be accelerated by core technologies, like machine learning, AI, and quantum computing. We are deeply convinced that we need to develop this knowledge within Europe and want to help ensure that European companies developing these technologies find the right environment in their home markets, rather than outside of Europe.”</p>
<p>Endeit emerged out of Endemol, the breakout media giant of the last 25 years. Deitmers and Endeit co-founder Martijn Hamann built Endemol out of the Netherlands into a publicly listed, global firm, acquiring 80+ businesses along the way. Endemol was later sold for many billions.</p>
<p>Hamann added: “Every single aspect of Endeit Capital is focused on helping entrepreneurs who shape the internet future to move forward quickly. We are looking for entrepreneurs with a strong product and unwavering drive to build market-leading positions with us.</p>
<p>Speaking to me via zoom, Deitmers said: “We have been a long-time cross border investor. There’s strong cross fertilization between the Netherlands and Germany. It’s different than London or Paris, which are like centralized magnets. What you see in Germany is an ecosystem that is very decentralized, you have the Munich hub, you have the hub in Cologne, you have Berlin, Hamburg. Then there is Zurich, Vienna. So there are multiple hubs in the region. And that is good, and I think it also across Europe. And you have now multiple hubs as you have shown in your TechCrunch city survey. You see there are more and more cities popping up with their own specialties like Rotterdam, or Hamburg in logistics tech.”</p>
<p>Does he see any Brexit effects going on?: &#8220;I think on the FinTech side you do see some changes to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris. I think specifically Amsterdam is benefiting a bit from a FinTech boost. We just closed a deal last week in a neobank there. The financial centers are shifting a little bit.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery startup Zomato on Wednesday filed for an initial public offering, ushering a new era for tech unicorn startups in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market after years of promising growth.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered Indian startup, which counts Info Edge and Ant Group among its largest investors, plans to raise $1.1 billion from the IPO (about $1 billion from issuing new shares), it <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/apr-2021/zomato-limited-drhp_49956.html">said in the filing</a> to the local market regulator. The startup, which has businesses in 24 markets, intends to list on Indian stock exchanges NSE and BSE.</p>
<p>Zomato, which has raised over $2.2 billion (according to research firm Tracxn), and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">valued at $5.4 billion</a> in its most recent fundraise round, said it may consider raising an additional $200 million ahead of public listing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A lot is riding on Zomato&#8217;s eventual listing on Indian stock exchanges. A successful listing is poised to encourage nearly a dozen other unicorn Indian startups to accelerate their efforts to tap the public markets.</p>
<p>Indian startups have raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/indian-startups-raised-9-3-billion-in-2020/">tens of billions of dollars</a> in the past decade, but have so far been largely reluctant to tap the public markets. In recent years, successful listing by a handful of firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/indiamart-ipo/">including IndiaMart</a>, and mobile gaming firm Nazara has shown that investors in India do have strong appetite for tech stocks.</p>
<p>Some key insights shared by Zomato in the filing today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zomato has claimed market leading position in the Indian food delivery market.<br />

<li>The startup identified Prosus Ventures-backed Swiggy (which is also in <a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">talks to raise capital from SoftBank Vision Fund 2</a>, as well as restaurants such as Domino&#8217;s, McDonald&#8217;s and Pizza Hut and cloud kitchen operators such as Rebel Foods as its competitor. (But not Amazon, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">entered the Indian food delivery market last year.</a></li>
<li>The startup clocked $183.6 million in revenue between April 1 and December 31 2020. Its losses during this period were $91.8 million.</li>
<li>The startup said it has a history of net losses, and it anticipates increased expenses in the future.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144830 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="710" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg 1330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zomato-financials.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></li>
<li>Info Edge plans to sell stake worth $100 million, the investment firm said in a stock exchange filing.</li>
<li>Zomato has identified &#8220;changing regulation in India,&#8221; ability to raise foreign capital, and &#8220;political changes&#8221; among over dozens of risk factors that could potentially affect its business in the future.</li>
<li>The startup, which employs 3,469 people across the globe as of December 31, plans to invest 75% of the IPO proceedings to grow its Zomato Pro membership offering, which allows customers to avail additional benefits, and Hyperpure, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/zomato-gold-nrai/">B2B supplies business</a>, and also deepen its relationship with restaurant partners.</li>
<li>Zomato says by the third quarter of last year, going by the metric GOV (gross order value), it had recovered from the Covid crisis. But some of its business lines including the dining-out business is &#8220;still recovering as customers continue to be reluctant to dine-out as a precautionary measure.&#8221;</li>
<li>As of December 2020, the startup had 161,637 active delivery partners, 350,174 active restaurant listings on the platform, of which 132,769 restaurants were also those who actively delivered to customers.</li>
<li>Zomato&#8217;s advertising and sales promotion expenses as percent of its total income, over the years:<br />

<li>Zomato says it has improved the unit economics of food delivery business in recent years.<br />

<li>Zomato last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired Uber Eats&#8217; India business</a>, and as part of the deal gave the American ride-hailing firm 9.9% stake in Zomato. (On a side note, it appears the <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1382190513722257409">only time Uber has ever turned a profit</a> is when it has sold its businesses in some markets to local rivals.) Its current list of shareholders, who assume at least 1% of the business, stands as following:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.founderscircle.com/">Founders Circle Capital</a>, a nine-year-old, San Francisco-based investment firm that strikes agreements with private, venture-backed companies to buy some of the vested stock options of their founders and employees &#8212; so they can buy a house or just breathe a bit more easily &#8212; has closed its newest fund with $355 million in capital commitments, bringing the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the outfit, which has more competition than ever &#8212; both by other <a href="https://www.industryventures.com/recent_news/industry-ventures-raises-oversubscribed-850-million-secondary-fund/">secondary investment firms</a>, aggressive outfits like Tiger Global that routinely <a href="https://entrackr.com/2020/03/tiger-global-invests-in-chinese-tech-giant-bytedance/">acquire secondary stakes</a> in companies, as well as special purpose acquisition companies that are taking companies public a lot faster and alleviating the need of early shareholders to cash out via private sales &#8212; is also introducing a new twist to its business.</p>
<p>Specifically, according to both co-founder Ken Loveless and the outfit&#8217;s chief people officer, Mark Dempster, Founders Circle is now offering startups so-called flexible capital, too. We talked with Loveless and Dempster via Zoom late last week about the new fund and generally what they are seeing out there. Excerpts from that chat, edited for length and clarity, follow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: This is your third fund. How does it compare with your earlier funds?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We&#8217;ve raised three main funds. This is our third, but we&#8217;ve raised something like 17 entities [altogether], including some co-investment vehicles and special purpose vehicles to invest in some of our companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And you&#8217;re now changing your approach a bit. How so?</strong></p>
<p>MD: [We&#8217;re now offering] a mix of primary and secondary [investment dollars] and we can [offer these] any time and in any combination. These [investments] don&#8217;t have to happen during a certain [distinct] round of financing; we might get involved in eight to 10 different investments [tied to the company].</p>
<p><strong>TC: How has your world changed now that people perhaps see a light at the end of the tunnel, with companies becoming publicly traded entities in a variety of ways that we didn&#8217;t see until more recently? Are employees or founders any more or less reluctant to sell their shares in secondary transactions?</strong></p>
<p>KL: There hasn&#8217;t been any significant change. We had a portfolio company go public in UiPath that was 16 years old and if you think about how many things change in your life over that kind of time period, it would be quite a long list. We also had [stakes] in DoorDash and Poshmark, and if you look at the time between when they were founded and became publicly traded, it was close to a decade for both. So [while there is some market receptivity for companies] that really are two years old or three years old, the average [time from launch to publicly traded company] is still 10-plus years on average.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of outfits are competing for the same shares that you want to buy, including Tiger Global, which is paying very high prices in many cases. In addition to competing with these companies, would you ever sell your shares to them?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We are typically a long-only investor. We have not sold any secondary shares. We typically hold through a public offering. We&#8217;re really trying to focus on those companies that can truly be in enduring, decades-old businesses. We obviously wouldn&#8217;t hold that long, but we&#8217;re holding into the public markets.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long do you hold your shares?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We&#8217;re not bound [by anything] but what we tell our [investors] is that we typically hold for an average of one year post public offering [then distribute the shares to them].</p>
<p><strong>TC: How, if at all, are you playing this SPAC phenomenon? Are you seeing opportunities to jump into these blank check companies before they merge with brands you&#8217;ve maybe been tracking?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We have not directly participated in a SPAC, but we have had some of our portfolio companies merged with some SPACs, so we&#8217;ve taken advantage of [those exits] as a financing tool.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been at this for roughly a decade. How many companies have you backed and how many of these have exited?</strong></p>
<p>MD: We&#8217;ve invested in 73 companies and 31 have exited.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know you tend to invest at a later stage &#8212; have there been any shutdowns owing to unforeseen circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>MD: We&#8217;ve had zero company shutdowns.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And what about prices you&#8217;re having to pay? How has that changed over the last year or so?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We just did an analysis of this and if you adjust for growth, we have not seen a substantial raise in valuations that we have paid compared to where prices were pre-pandemic. We&#8217;re paying the same dollar for a point of growth as we were before [COVID-19 struck the U.S.].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>KL: Companies that have solid unit economics have become better at both benchmarking their internal metrics, and investors have become better at understanding those and metrics. The consistency and underwriting by investors is becoming better and better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche has always gone its own way when it comes to creating new vehicles. It is, after all, the company that continues to stick to the wacky idea that putting the weight of an engine in the rear of a sports car is a great idea. (It is!)</p>
<p>So, bucking the crossover trend to create an all-electric, soft-roading wagon with just 20 more millimeters of clearance than their popular electric Taycan sedan isn&#8217;t out of character for the brand. Instead, it’s another example of how Porsche approaches electrification.&#8221;You don&#8217;t make an electric car. You make a Porsche with an electric powertrain,&#8221; Calvin Kim, product spokesperson for the Taycan line, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The 2021 Taycan Cross Turismo fits that bill. Powerful, quick, comfortable, luxurious and tech-laden, the Porsche Taycan 4 Cross Turismo (one of four variants of the wagon) offers a blend of practicality with a whole lot of power and speed for under $100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Why build an electric Porsche wagon?</h2>
<p>Porsche upended the sports car enthusiast club when it launched the Cayenne nearly 20 years ago and is doing the same with the Taycan and the Taycan Cross Turismo. While the SUV and crossover business is still a tremendous cash cow for the company, nearly 4,500 Taycans were sold in 2020, according to a recent release from Porsche. That&#8217;s more than either the 718 or the Panamera line. Porsche also says that from cradle to manufacturing, the new Cross Turismo is carbon neutral — the first vehicle they&#8217;ve made that has achieved that status.</p>
<p>“Porsche wanted to create the most sporty capability we can make,” Kim said, “and a wagon version of the Taycan embodies that ethos.”</p>
<p>The 2021 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo is on sale today. Porsche says that it expects deliveries to start this summer.</p>

<h2>Taycan versus Taycan Cross Turismo</h2>
<p>Beyond the obvious form factor, prospective buyers or EV enthusiasts might wonder why someone might opt for a Cross Turismo over the original Taycan?</p>
<p>There are a few important differences between the two vehicles that might push some customers over to the wagon. First up, the Cross Turismo offers more passenger and cargo space. Passengers get an additional 0.35 inches of headroom up front and 3.69 inches in the back. The wagon is also equipped with more cargo space — 15.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats or 42.8 cubic feet with them folded forward. Like the Taycan, the Cross Turismo has an additional 2.9 cubic feet of area in the frunk.</p>
<p>The Cross Turismo also has a skosh 20 millimeters (just short of 1 inch) more ground clearance than the Taycan sedan and an additional driving mode called Gravel. Gravel mode is activated by a soft key on the center console rather than by the mode wheel on the steering wheel. It raises the car&#8217;s height and makes changes to the stability control and torque management system for better grip on gravel, snow or ice. Unfortunately, on our short test drive, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to put Gravel mode to the test.</p>

<p>On top of these features, the Taycan Cross Turismo comes with all-wheel drive and standard air suspension (called Porsche Active Suspension Management or PASM), which, on the Taycan, is a $2,200 option. The Taycan Cross Turismo comes standard with the larger 93.4 kWh battery pack, which is a $5,780 option on the base Taycan sedan. The Cross Turismo is built on the same platform as the Taycan sedan, known as J1, internally.</p>
<p>There are four different variants of the Taycan Cross Turismo, including the one I drove. You can choose from the entry-level Taycan 4 Cross Turismo, the Taycan 4S Cross Turismo, the Taycan Turbo Cross Turismo and the Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo. At the highest trims, base prices start at $188,000. Pricing for the Taycan 4 Cross Turismo that I drove starts at $92,250 (including delivery).</p>
<p>Each flavor of Cross Turismo comes with an optional off-road package that adds lower body cladding to prevent rock chips on gravel roads and raises the vehicle by 10 millimeters. Porsche doesn&#8217;t state the ground clearance for the Taycan or the Taycan Cross Turismo, but approach and departure angles increase from 12.1 and 15.2 degrees to 12.2 and 16.2 degrees in the electric wagon.  In true Porsche fashion, the company says that there are more than 21,000 option combinations based solely on which Cross Turismo you choose, wheel choice, exterior color and interior selection, not to mention details like badge deletion, stitching, technology options and seat types.</p>
<p>Charging speeds are the same between the Cross Turismo and the Taycan. Porsche says that on DC fast chargers, the Taycan Cross Turismo can recharge from 5% to 80% in just 22.5-minutes.</p>

<h2>First drive</h2>
<p>The Taycan Cross Turismo 4, which I drove, represents the entry point to the new all-electric wagon. While neither Porsche nor the EPA has released range estimates, the European-spec, ruby red machine had just over 250 miles of range at 99% charge when I hopped into it for a Monday afternoon jaunt from Glendale, California to Big Bear and back. That nearly 200-mile trip left me with 68 miles of range in the proverbial tank. While it may seem like that math is off, it’s not, thanks to regenerative braking that helps generate electricity and push some of it back into the battery.</p>
<p>The drive consisted of about 140 miles along the highway and some 60 miles on mountain roads. Thanks to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive setup that comes standard on all Cross Turismos, the electric wagon felt planted and secure on misty and slightly icy mountain roads and took corners without a modicum of body roll. With a 375 horsepower (469 with launch control) and maximum available 368 lb-ft of torque, passing a sluggish motorist (or three at once) was handled with ease.</p>
<p>The Cross Turismo gets five different driving modes: Range, Normal, Sport, Sport Plus and Individual. On the highway, I started in Normal mode and noticed how easy it was to push the vehicle beyond the stated speed limit. Using the toggle on the wheel, I switched to Range mode, which helps conserve battery by limiting speed to just 80 miles per hour. All of the modes except Range allow the driver to take the Cross Turismo to its full 136-mile-per-hour potential.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144702" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144702" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2144702 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg" alt="Porsche Taycan4_Cross_Turismo" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Taycan4_Cross_Turismo_086_MA906751.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144702" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Porsche</p></div></p>
<p>My test vehicle was a European model. This meant that certain tech features that come with the Cross Turismo, including Porsche’s advanced driving assistance system InnoDrive and the navigation features, couldn’t be activated since my test drive was in the United States. However, the regular adaptive cruise control did work and I used it extensively on the highway run from Glendale to the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>The Taycan Cross Turismo’s adaptive cruise adapted quickly to the numerous drivers who cut into my lane. The feature handled these tricky moments the same way I would have, only with a bit more finesse. When a car swerved unexpectedly into my lane, the Cross Turismo slowed without slamming the brakes or stuttering and simply drew the 5,029-pound vehicle down to a slower speed and a comfortable following distance that was neither too short nor too long. As traffic sped up, the system would maintain the following distance without jostling or awkward pauses.</p>
<p>When I reached the base of the mountain, I had around 200 miles of range left. I toggled the Cross Turismo into Sport Plus mode and began the climb. In Sport and Sport Plus, the &#8220;engine noise&#8221; (for lack of a better term) inside the cabin becomes more audible. Porsche says that to create the sound, they recorded the motors&#8217; audio, adjusted it and then piped the sound into the cabin. Outside the cabin in both modes, the vehicle becomes a bit louder but not nearly as raucous as a combustion Porsche.</p>
<p>The roads leading to Big Bear are more winter-worn than those in the Los Angeles Basin and have plenty of cracks and potholes after a wet season. On the day I drove the route, it was misty and around 40 degrees, with frost licking the tips of the pines at higher elevations giving them a silver hue. The road was wet and wound through dense patches of cloud and fog, causing a few small icy spots on the roadway. The Cross Turismo took all of those challenges in stride.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever hustled a heavy and relatively large vehicle up a technical and twisting road, you know the body roll battle all too well. It&#8217;s a non-issue in the Cross Turismo. Because the body weight (battery and motors) are set low into the floor, the Cross Turismo feels as planted, comfortable and capable as a 911. The steering is direct and communicative without being twitchy. On the climb, I managed to trim off roughly 10 minutes on my estimated arrival without breaking a sweat or really pushing the car anywhere near the limit. At the predetermined coffee stop, I&#8217;d worn the battery down to 118 miles &#8212; plenty to get me back to Glendale with room to spare.</p>
<p>I ran the mountain road in Sport and cruised back to the valley. At the bottom of the mountain road, I noted that the vehicle had gained a few miles back thanks to regenerative braking and had 124 miles remaining. Throwing range anxiety to the wind and vowing to keep my eyes up for potential speed traps, I kept the Taycan Cross Turismo in Sport mode and zipped my way through 3 p.m. traffic, arriving back at the studio with plenty of power to spare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rather than a CEO-slamming sound bite free-for-all,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/senate-judiciary-tech-hearing-algorithms-twitter-youtube-facebook/"> Tuesday&#8217;s big tech hearing on algorithms</a> aimed for more of a listening session vibe — and in that sense it mostly succeeded.</p>
<p>The hearing centered on testimony from the policy leads at Facebook, YouTube and Twitter rather than the chief executives of those companies for a change. The resulting few hours didn’t offer any massive revelations but was still probably more productive than squeezing some of the world’s most powerful men for their commitments to “get back to you on that.”</p>
<p>In the hearing, lawmakers bemoaned social media echo chambers and the ways that the algorithms pumping content through platforms are capable of completely reshaping human behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“&#8230; This advanced technology is harnessed into algorithms designed to attract our time and attention on social media, and the results can be harmful to our kids’ attention spans, to the quality of our public discourse, to our public health, and even to our democracy itself,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), chair of the Senate Judiciary&#8217;s subcommittee on privacy and tech, which held the hearing.</p>
<p>Coons struck a cooperative note, observing that algorithms drive innovation but that their dark side comes with considerable costs</p>
<p>None of this is new, of course. But Congress is crawling closer to solutions, one repetitive tech hearing at a time. The Tuesday hearing highlighted some zones of bipartisan agreement that could determine the chances of a tech reform bill passing the Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Democrats. Coons expressed optimism that a “broadly bipartisan solution” could be reached.</p>
<p>What would that look like? Probably changes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/section-230/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, which we’ve written about extensively over the years. That law protects social media companies from liability for user-created content and it’s been a major nexus of tech regulation talk, both in the newly Democratic Senate under Biden and the previous Republican-led Senate that took its cues from Trump.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144660" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144660" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?w=680" alt="Lauren Culbertson, head of U.S. public policy at Twitter" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144660" class="wp-caption-text">Lauren Culbertson, head of U.S. public policy at Twitter Inc., speaks remotely during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 27, 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Al Drago/Bloomberg / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<h2>A broken business model</h2>
<p>In the hearing, lawmakers pointed to flaws inherent to how major social media companies make money as the heart of the problem. Rather than criticizing companies for specific failings, they mostly focused on the core business model from which social media’s many ills spring forth.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s very important for us to push back on the idea that really complicated, qualitative problems have easy quantitative solutions,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said. He argued that because social media companies make money by keeping users hooked to their products, any real solution would have to upend that business model altogether.</p>
<p>“The business model of these companies is addiction,&#8221; Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) echoed, calling social media an “attention treadmill” by design.</p>
<p>Ex-Googler and frequent tech critic Tristan Harris didn’t mince words about how tech companies talk around that central design tenet in his own testimony. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like listening to a hostage in a hostage video,&#8221; Harris said, likening the engagement-seeking business model to a gun just offstage.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Section 230</h2>
<p>One big way lawmakers propose to disrupt those deeply entrenched incentives? Adding algorithm-focused exceptions to the Section 230 protections that social media companies enjoy. A few bills floating around take that approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/10/kennedy-applauds-house-companion-to-don-t-push-my-buttons-act">One bill</a> introduced in 2020 from Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) would require platforms with 10 million or more users to obtain consent before serving users content based on their behavior or demographic data if they want to keep Section 230 protections. The idea is to revoke 230 immunity from platforms that boost engagement by “funneling information to users that polarizes their views” unless a user specifically opts in.</p>
<p>In another bill, the <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-eshoo-and-malinowski-reintroduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-accountable">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a>, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) propose suspending Section 230 protections and making companies liable “if their algorithms amplify misinformation that leads to offline violence.” That bill would amend Section 230 to reference existing civil rights laws.</p>
<p>Section 230’s defenders <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/two-different-proposals-amend-section-230-share-similar-goal-damage-online-users">argue</a> that any insufficiently targeted changes to the law could disrupt the modern internet as we know it, resulting in cascading negative impacts well beyond the intended scope of reform efforts. An outright repeal of the law is almost certainly off the table, but even small tweaks could completely realign internet businesses, for better or worse.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Hawley made a broader suggestion for companies that use algorithms to chase profits. &#8220;Why shouldn’t we just remove Section 230 protection from any platform that engages in behavioral advertising or algorithmic amplification?&#8221; he asked, adding that he wasn’t opposed to an outright repeal of the law.</p>

<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, connected the algorithmic concerns to anti-competitive behavior in the tech industry. “If you have a company that buys out everyone from under them … we’re never going to know if they could have developed the bells and whistles to help us with misinformation because there is no competition,” Klobuchar said.</p>
<p>Subcommittee members Klobuchar and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) have their own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">major Section 230 reform bill, the Safe Tech Act</a>, but that legislation is less concerned with algorithms than ads and paid content.</p>
<p>At least one more major bill looking at Section 230 through the lens of algorithms is still on the way. Prominent Big Tech critic House Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) is due to propose a Section 230 bill soon that could suspend liability protections for companies that rely on algorithms to boost engagement and line their pockets.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a very complicated algorithm that is designed to maximize engagement to drive up advertising prices to produce greater profits for the company,&#8221; <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">Cicilline told Axios last month</a>. &#8221; … That&#8217;s a set of business decisions for which, it might be quite easy to argue, that a company should be liable for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Alphabet, Microsoft and Pinterest reported their quarterly earnings results for the first three months of 2021. Microsoft and Pinterest have rapidly lost value after reporting their results, while Alphabet appreciated after its own earnings download.</p>
<p>Sparing you a deluge of numbers, here&#8217;s what TechCrunch is pondering from each report in as few words as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alphabet&#8217;s <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78">earnings</a> were strong across a number of fronts; investors cheered. </strong>YouTube revenue grew nearly 50% to $6 billion, search ads performed well, and even the infamously unprofitable &#8220;Other Bets&#8221; ground managed to post nearly $200 million in revenue. But the most notable result from the technology conglomerate was its cloud results. Google Cloud grew from $2.777 billion in revenue and an operating loss of $1.73 billion in the year-ago quarter to revenues of $4.047 billion and an operating loss of just $974 million. The Mountain View-based agglomeration of tech services is building not only a material revenue stream out of a non-ad-based product, but one that could generate material operating income in time. If trends hold.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-21-Q3/press-release-webcast">earnings</a> report was pretty good despite Wall Street disinterest. </strong>Microsoft grew 17% from its year-ago quarter while pushing its operating income up 31% to $17 billion; faster growing income compared to revenue is indicative of operating leverage. The company&#8217;s net income actually grew even more rapidly than its operating income, which is sharper than expected. Azure, the company&#8217;s Google Cloud and AWS competitor, grew 50% in the quarter, which met expectations <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q3-2021.html">per CNBC</a>. Microsoft remains incredibly rich, and its most future-looking products put up some pretty big numbers. Not bad!</li>
<li><b>Pinterest <a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Pinterest-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results/">posted</a> a monster quarter. Wall Street was not impressed.</b> Pinterest&#8217;s Q1 2021 revenue of $485.230 million was up 78% compared to the year-ago quarter, the company cut its net loss from $141.196 million to $21.674 million at the same time, and its non-GAAP net income rose from -$59.916 million to $78.527 million during the first three months of the year. The result of this wildly impressive quarter? Its shares are off more than 8%. One reason Pinterest may have dropped is that the company missed on monthly active users (478 million reported, 480.5 million <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3685627-pinterest-q1-2021-earnings-preview">expected</a>), and warned that it would see &#8220;sequential operating expense growth [ … ] accelerate in Q2.&#8221; But with the company anticipating 105% revenue growth in the current quarter and midteens MAU growth in the same period, it&#8217;s hard to be that mad at the company. Unless we&#8217;re missing something major here, Pinterest is being punished by investors who simply expected even more?</li>
</ul>
<p>And there you have it, a very quick catch up. I am not supposed to cover earnings much anymore, but while you can take the pig from the shit, it&#8217;s hard to get the pig to not blog about earnings!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exyn Technologies announced Tuesday that it has achieved what it considers the highest level of aerial autonomy reached within the industry. The key to the achievement is that Exyn drones are immune to GPS signal loss, meaning all spatial and mapping computations are done onboard, the company said.</p>
<p>Under Exyn&#8217;s definitions of autonomy, which are based on a similar standard applied to automotive, the company&#8217;s drones have achieved Level 4A autonomy. This means the drones are able to explore a designated 3D area without a remote operator in the backseat, according to Exyn.</p>
<p>Exyn’s achievement is a major step up from the previous level 3 of autonomy, in which a human is required to be present to potentially take over, something that has prevented drones from entering spaces without ranging signals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Level 3 aerial autonomy landscape is also defined by point-to-point navigation, in which an operator lays out a sequence of locations for a robot to visit, and the robot does its best to get there. <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/xwing-plans-short-regional-flights-for-its-autonomous-cargo-planes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/xwing-plans-short-regional-flights-for-its-autonomous-cargo-planes/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Autonomous aviation startup Xwing&#8217;s self-flying utility aircraft</a> will operate on this level by following specific flight paths. However, in real-life use cases, an operator might not have intimate knowledge of the operating environment, and the robot might not be able to access existing maps to learn from and inform its movements.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We developed an autonomous system that can take you into dark, dirty, dangerous environments,” Exyn’s CTO Jason Derenick told TechCrunch. “Place it at the edge of danger and send it off to collect the information that you need. Oftentimes the information you need is beyond the line of sight, both in terms of communications as well as visual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exyn&#8217;s drones are given a capability the company calls &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwH9m5rPJlc&amp;ab_channel=ExynTechnologies">scoutaunomy</a>,&#8221; which involves defining a “bounding box volume” around which the drone can fly. Using lidar sensors, the drone can identify volume between explored and unexplored spaces in order to self-navigate and create an accurate, high-resolution map of the space. The drones, which are hardware-agnostic, can also carry additional sensors that collect further information to be integrated onto the maps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of building a three-dimensional map and then draping on top of it RGB information from the camera, so now you&#8217;ve got a photorealistic 3D representation of the space,” Nader Elm, CEO of Exyn Technologies, told TechCrunch. “If we&#8217;re carrying heat and humidity sensors, getting radiological reading, getting gas readings, checking the ventilation, et cetera. That’s going to be a very rich dataset that currently underground mining doesn’t have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Exyn Technologies’ use cases are in the mining industry, with clients like Rupert Resources and Dundee Precious Metals, where the ability to chart the unknown can keep miners safe and inform better business decisions. The company recently announced a partnership with Swedish mining and construction giant Sandvik that will involve integrating Exyn’s mapping software with Sandvik’s mapping analytics capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exyn is also working with government customers for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well as in nuclear energy, construction and logistics, according to the company. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be clear: The venture capital industry has lacked diversity. The good news is the industry is working to improve itself.</p>
<p>To begin with, as an industry, venture capital can only improve what we measure. In 2016, we set out to develop a rigorous methodology for tracking progress on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in venture capital, and to measure and benchmark those data through our biennial <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">VC Human Capital Survey</a>.</p>
<p>The goals of the survey — powered by the National Venture Capital Association, Venture Forward and Deloitte — are to collect demographic data on the VC workforce across all firm types, sizes, stages, sectors and geographies, as well as trends on firm talent management and recruitment practices. We&#8217;ve learned that progress can be slow and seem discouraging, but we&#8217;ve also captured evidence that diversity (and firm practices to advance diversity) is increasing in some areas, even as other areas have unfortunately not seen the same pace of change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>We fielded the survey in 2016, 2018 and 2020, and released the outcomes of the third edition last month, featuring data (as of June 30, 2020) collected from 378 firms, a marked increase from 203 participating firms in 2018. Furthermore, more than 145 firms signed the <a href="https://nvca.org/nvca-and-venture-forward-vchumancapital-pledge/">#VCHumanCapital pledge</a> to publicly commit to submitting their DEI data.</p>
<p>At a high level, the data showed that improvements in diversity among investment partners have largely been driven by the hiring and advancement of female investors, while there has been little progress in the equitable representation of Black or Hispanic investment partners.</p>
<p>However, the demographic composition of junior investment professionals reflects greater diversity and wider adoption of diversity-focused talent management and recruitment practices suggest some cause for optimism. The industry still has a long way to go, but here are some of the key insights and changes we identified from the latest survey.</p>
<h2>Intentionality associated with improved diversity</h2>
<p>More firms are explicitly assigning responsibility for promoting diversity and inclusion internally &#8212; 50% of firms have a staff person or team tasked with this responsibility (compared with 34% in 2018 and 16% in 2016). Simultaneously, diversity and inclusion strategies have become more widespread; 43% of firms have implemented a diversity strategy (against 32% in 2018 and 24% in 2016), while 41% have an inclusion strategy (versus 31% in 2018 and 17% in 2016).</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EWYXnpHAVS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/">On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/embed/#?secret=EWYXnpHAVS" data-secret="EWYXnpHAVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This intentionality translates to improved diversity outcomes. Firms with dedicated DEI staff, strategies and programs achieve greater gender and racial diversity on investment teams and among investment partners. The increased emphasis on DEI is also a broader ecosystem trend. More firms report that limited partners and portfolio companies have requested their DEI details over the past 12 months.</p>
<h2>Encouraging signs in talent recruitment and development</h2>
<p>Venture firms are relatively small and turnover is generally low, but 21% of firms in 2020 reported their number of senior-level investment positions had increased, while 43% said their number of junior-level positions had expanded. Meanwhile, the demographic composition of junior investment professionals reflects higher gender and racial diversity, a positive leading indicator for the diversity of future investment partners.</p>
<p>As overall DEI strategies have become increasingly widespread, more firms have also developed DEI-focused recruitment and hiring programs — 33% of firms have <em>formal</em> programs, while 74% have <em>informal</em> programs, both reflecting steady increases from 2016. Firms were also more likely to report that they typically seek external candidates for open positions than they did in 2018.</p>
<p>However, firms continue to largely rely on internal networks for recruitment, which often encourages homogeneous hiring outcomes. Between the 2018 and 2020 surveys, there was little change shown in the use of narrow recruitment methods to find external candidates; notifying peers in the VC industry (78%) and notifying the firm internally (59%) were the strategies cited most often. The exception was posting on third-party websites like LinkedIn or in newsletters, a strategy reported by 54% of firms in 2020 (a substantial increase from 37% in 2018), which presents one avenue to reach a broader audience of candidates outside of existing networks.</p>
<h2>Assessing inclusion remains a challenge</h2>
<p>Once talent has come on board, inclusive culture and retention become key metrics of DEI progress. More firms are implementing programs dedicated to leadership development, mentorship and retention, with about two-thirds reporting <em>informal</em> versions of such programs (20 percentage points higher than in 2016) and 20% of firms reporting <em>formal</em> programs.</p>
<p>Assessing inclusion through the VC Human Capital Survey is challenging because we survey one representative per firm, and one person cannot speak to the degree of inclusion felt by others. However, we added a new question to the 2020 survey to gauge how firms themselves are assessing inclusion. While 41% of firms reported having an inclusion strategy, only 26% said they conduct surveys of their employees to assess inclusion.</p>
<h2>Subjective factors remain a key consideration in promotions</h2>
<p>Well-structured, consistently applied policies for career advancement are critical to ensuring that diverse talent reaches the most senior decision-making levels of the industry. About 20% of firms reported having <em>formal</em> DEI programs focused on promotion (up from 5% in 2016), while 65% of firms have <em>informal</em> programs (compared with 39% in 2016).</p>
<p>Although DEI programs focused on the promotion of employees are more widespread, subjective factors remain a key consideration for promotion decisions, which can lead to unequal and biased outcomes.</p>
<p>Almost all firms reported that “contributions to the performance of the fund” (90%) and “deal origination” (82%) were very important or important factors in considering promotions. However, the factor most often rated highly was “soft skills,” with 94% of firms saying it was very important or important. These types of subjective factors present significant opportunity for unconscious bias to creep in and can detract from the weight given to objective measures more demonstrably relevant to performance.</p>
<h2>Maintaining momentum</h2>
<p>The results of the third edition of our survey are timely, coming on the heels of a year in which social justice and racial equity have been the subjects of sharp national focus, policymakers have sought to increase access to capital for underserved communities, and the VC industry has shown a renewed focus on DEI. The survey shows where the VC industry’s efforts should be focused and also serves as an important reminder of the intersectional needs of DEI-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>The data show that progress within one demographic element can be more nuanced when considering people who represent multiple marginalized communities (e.g., the percentage of investment partners who are women has steadily increased, but the percentage of investment partners who are women of color has not).</p>
<p>The pace of DEI progress has been slow and uneven in some areas, but there are reasons for optimism. On April 6, NVCA, Venture Forward and Deloitte hosted a discussion with industry leaders to further examine the latest survey results and to address DEI challenges, opportunities and strategies for the industry. More firms are prioritizing these constructive conversations, both within their firms and publicly with industry peers. More firms are acting in a collaborative spirit, adopting thoughtful and concrete DEI strategies and acting with intentionality and urgency.</p>
<p>If the industry can continue to build upon this momentum and commitment around DEI efforts, we can reach a tipping point that will translate to meaningful progress reflected in future editions of the survey.</p>
