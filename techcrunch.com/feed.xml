										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSFbbwG5Peo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Still figuring out what this newsletter is, I’m torn between aggregation and writing. The inputs vary from blog posts, Twitter threads, and the occasional video. Podcasting seems oddly muzzled by the acceleration of streaming. Blog posts are a misnomer; professional blogs represent the bulk of news and media citations, not usually the single voices of RSS yore.</p>
<p>Linear media is bifurcated between quick takes like The Recount and user tweets of streaming cable news. Podcasting meets longer form streaming with live casting on Facebook Live, Twitter (formerly Periscope), YouTube, and nascent LinkedIn live. As I discovered during a Restreamed recording session of the Gang, the Facebook Live version includes realtime captioning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On this version of the show, recorded four days before the Inauguration of the Biden presidency, a familiar mood radiates from the Zoomcast. Anxiety, tinged with doubt that we will escape the grip of the pandemic any time soon, or the blight of Trump-o-nomics at all. Now, as I post this, there’s a reasonable chance of a renewal of rationality and respect. Then, it was a jump ball at best.</p>
<p>When we record the show, I leave either CNN or MSNBC on the monitor behind me. Given that we configure Zoom in Gallery Mode for the most part, that ups the chance that one of us will notice if some breaking news (haha) appears. It’s mostly for the sense of being plugged in without being overwhelmed by the repetitive analysis that oh, yes we are in deep trouble. Controlled anxiety beats plain old anxiety most of the time. Nonetheless, I still get complaints from viewers to turn it off.</p>
<p>I like the delay of the realtime version to accommodate post production sweetening with music and lower third titles. The interval gives me a chance to come up with a theme for this post to accompany the mixed show, and it allows for some of the buzzy issues to recede in favor of more sticky foreshadowing of the next show. Around this time, we usually come up with a title for the show. You may not find this all that interesting, but it helps me endure my pathetic contributions to the show.</p>
<p>On this session, Frank Radice is heard quoting lines from Firesign Theatre records. In the early days, we used to sit around college dorms and what we thought passed for hippie crash pads, reciting these Firesign catch phrases. In slightly earlier times, we did this with Bill Cosby records, in later years Monty Python routines. Michael Markman had posted to the Gang Telegram feed a Wisconsin Public Radio conversation with the two surviving TFTers Phil Proctor and David Ossman.</p>
<p>Back then, the comedy group had released I Think We’re All Bozos on This Bus, featuring a futuristic ride on a Firesign update of the Disneyland animatronic Presidents attraction. Now, Michael wondered whether Disney would add Trump to the ride when it reopens. It’s a good question. What, whether Disneyland will reopen?</p>
<p>So, newsletters. It seems possible the form is subsuming many of the pieces of blogging, podcasting, streaming, and social networking into a new construct. Where blogs once represented a ticket to parity with the mainstream of journalism, now journalists are acquiring parity with individual voices. Cable news not only feels like podcasting with its oversupply of talking head roundtables, but each anchor has a separate podcast to boot. Just as the record business ate the movies business with Saturday Night Fever, so too are the cable networks eating the broadcast networks as they are in turn eaten by the streamers.</p>
<p>And just as the former president was deplatformed by the social networks, live streamers are replatformed in this newslettered channel-in-your-pocket. Commentary, notification-based two-way feedback, realtime analytics, first party data relationships with creators and subscribers. More creation, less curation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Robinhood, a startup that promises to make finance accessible for all, temporarily limited trading on GameStop, AMC, and other memestocks, many retail investors were pissed that the fintech darling suddenly didn’t live up to its name. The specific reasons may have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">short-term and technical</a>, but the choice looked corrupt to the average person.</p>
<p>Here’s why: The presence of a massive hedge fund as a main Robinhood partner and supporter of the short-sellers is exactly what Robinhood users are rallying against. The obvious conflict shows that “democratizing finance” was always somewhat of an ironic tagline. Retail investors are already pouring into competitor apps like <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/ ">Public and Webull</a>, and looking for more shorts to take on.</p>
<p>What can other startups learn? Here are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">some lessons</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, the push for decentralized systems will become more aggressive, positioning startups in the cryptocurrency and overall DeFi space well. On Thursday, Reddit co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian">Alexis Ohanian</a> spoke to Congresswoman <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> on a Twitch stream about the GameStop saga.</p>
<p>“No one&#8217;s gonna wake up in a week and be like let’s all go back to how it was. The collective public cannot unsee this, and so I think that there’s going to be more and more energy to find decentralized solutions. There is so much energy to rally behind something that isn’t capable of having the game rigged,” Ohanian said. As Bitcoin reaches record highs, the Robinhood meltdown only further adds momentum to the asset.</p>
<p>My second takeaway is that fintech startups in the retail trading space have never been more aware of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-trading-apps-are-responding-to-the-gamestop-fustercluck/ "> iron fist of regulatory pressure</a>. While one company may have fallen on the sword this time, it doesn’t mean that other startups are safe and/or able to promise open doors and a free market forever. The big question for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/female-led-startups-dominate-catalyst-funds-inclusive-fintech-2021-cohort/ ">early-stage fintech startups</a> is how to innovate amid a revolution.</p>
<p>That’s all I can make sense out of for now, and <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/ ">there’s more on the pod</a> if you’re interested. What do you think the long-term ramifications of this wild Wall Street week are on startups?

<h2>Climate tech sprouts</h2>
<p>Early-stage financing for climate tech is lackluster, but category startups need aggressive capital in order to grow to the correct scale (and, you know, save the world from eternal doom). Our reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/jshieber">Jonathan Shieber</a> covered a number of stories this week that shed light on how many investors in the ecosystem are waking up to the importance of climate tech.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Robert Downey Jr., launched a new rolling venture fund, powered by AngelList, <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/ ">to back sustainability startups. </a></p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Why one venture capitalist thinks <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/spacs-are-the-construct-vcs-need-to-fund-cleantech/ ">SPACs are the way to go for cleantech startups</a>. Also, an early-stage accelerator launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/urban-x-launches-its-latest-cohort-as-the-world-catches-up-to-the-accelerators-climate-thesis/">latest cohort of sustainable startups.</a></p>

<h2>Long live anything other than ‘Zoom School’</h2>
<p>It has been remarkable to witness the boom, and ensuing consolidation, of edtech in less than a year. In yet another busy week for the sector, uplifted by the pandemic’s blunt force of remote learning, we have financings, public market debuts and what more than a dozen of investors are looking for next.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">13 investors say that lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream. </a>Consumer edtech has always had an easier time selling, since parents spend more than a stodgy institution ever will. What’s new, though, is that there’s an opportunity to serve with learners beyond the school day. There’s much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">more in our investor survey</a>, along with details on what opportunities are fading in the sector, and what is the biggest hurdle for an early-stage edtech startup.</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>A company aiming to be the <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/inspirit-seed/ ">Minecraft of science class</a> just launched with seed financing from a flurry of investors. A company founded in 2011 spent eight years without monetizing, and <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/ ">now is profitable with hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers</a>. Oh, and an unprofitable but growing edtech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">is going public via SPAC</a>.</p>

<h2>SPAC it up</h2>
<p>SPACs are like weeds: If you pull one out, another one pops right up! 300 of ‘em, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>This week, Chamath Palihapitiya announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">two SPAC deals for Latch and Sunlight Financial</a>. My colleague and podcast co-host Alex Wilhelm unpacked the numbers behind these decisions in an Extra Crunch post.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/coinbase-is-going-public-via-direct-listing/ ">Coinbase is going public</a> via direct listing. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/squarespace-files-privately-to-go-public/ ">Squarespace filed privately </a>to go public. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/report-wework-could-be-getting-spacd-soon-too/ ">WeWork might be going public</a> through a reverse merger. And the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/after-soaring-above-23b-qualtrics-founder-and-ceo-reflect-on-a-stellar-debut/ ">Qualtrics CEO and founder sat down with TechCrunch</a> to reflect on its debut: <em>Qualtrics&#8230;had been told that it couldn’t bootstrap, that it couldn’t build in Utah, that SAP had overpaid, that SAP had messed up and so forth, </em>Wilhelm writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone.</p>
<p>And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re taking a look at the biggest news in the world of apps, including how the GameStop frenzy impacted trading apps, as well as how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes are taking shape in 2021, and more.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>The internet comes for the stock market, via trading apps</h3>

<p>Was there really any other app news story this week, beside the GameStop short squeeze? That a group of Reddit users took on the hedge funds was the stuff of legends, even if the reality was that Wall Street likely <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/game-stop">got in on both sides</a> of the trade. Whether you found yourself in the camp of admiring the spectacle or watching the train wreck in horror (or both), what we witnessed &#8212; at long last, I suppose &#8212; was the internet coming for the stock market. The GameStop frenzy upended the status quo; it rattled the traditional ways of doing things &#8212; much like what the internet has done to almost everything else it touches &#8212; whether that&#8217;s publishing, media, creation, politics, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is community,&#8221; explained Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, in an interview on AOC&#8217;s Twitch channel on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something that spans platforms and the internet, especially in the last 10 years &#8212; in particular social media and smartphone ubiquity. All these things have connected us in real-time ways to organize around ideas, around concepts,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We seek out those communities. We seek out that sense of identity. We seek out that sense of connection. And the internet supercharges it because of scale,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think one of the byproducts of where I think it continues to go is more of a push towards decentralization and more of a push toward individuals being able to take ownership &#8212; even individuals being able to get access &#8212; to do the same things that institutions, historically, had a monopoly on,&#8221; Ohanian noted.</p>
<p>Trading app Robinhood and social app Reddit, home to the WallStreetBets forum driving the GameStop push, immediately benefitted from the community-driven effort to squeeze the hedge funds &#8212; and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-and-reddit-top-the-app-store-as-trading-apps-surge-following-gamestop-mania/"> jumped to the top of the App Store.</a></p>
<p>But Robinhood&#8217;s subsequent failure to be transparent as to why it was forced to stop customers from buying the &#8220;meme&#8221; stocks, like GameStop and others (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-and-reddit-top-the-app-store-as-trading-apps-surge-following-gamestop-mania/">it needed more cash</a>), quickly damaged its reputation. Some investors have now sued for their losses. Others <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gme-remove-from-app-store/">started petitions</a>. And even more began downranking the app <a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1354803580713111553">with one-star reviews</a>, which Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">then removed.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Robinhood incident is a good reminder to founders: when you don’t tell people the real problem because you’re worried about how bad it will look, you almost always are rewarded by coming away looking much, much worse. <a href="https://t.co/NiBBGZPvSS">pic.twitter.com/NiBBGZPvSS</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Other trading apps have gained not only during the frenzy itself, but also after, as Robinhood users looked for alternative platforms after being burned by the free trading app.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Robinhood remained at No. 1 on the App Store, but is now being closely trailed on the Top Free iPhone apps chart by No. 2 Webull, No. 6 Fidelity, No. 7 Cash App, No. 12 TD Ameritrade and No. 15 E*TRADE, among others.</p>

<p>Crypto apps are also topping the charts, as users realize the potential of collective action in markets not yet dominated by the billionaires. Coinbase popped to No. 4, while Binance-run apps were at No. 9 and No. 19, Voyager was No. 23 and Kraken No. 24.</p>
<p>In addition, forums where traders can join communities are also continuing to do well, with Reddit at No. 3, Discord at No. 14 and Telegram at No. 28, as of the time of writing.</p>
<h3>Google says it will add those Apple privacy labels&#8230;<em>sometime</em>!</h3>

<p>Google failed to meet its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">earlier promised deadline</a> of rolling out privacy labels to its nearly 100-some iOS apps. Its initial estimate followed suggestions (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why">aided</a> by Apple&#8217;s typical quiet confirmations to press), that Google had been struggling over how to handle the privacy issues the updates would reveal. This week, Google again said its labels were on the way. But now, it&#8217;s not making any specific promises about when those labels would arrive. Instead, the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/preparing-developers-and-advertisers-for-policy-updates/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FATHs+%28Google+Ads+%26+Commerce+Blog%29">just said</a> the labels would roll out as Google updated its iOS apps with new features and bug fixes, rather than rolling out the labels to all its apps at once.</p>

<p>However, some Google apps have been updated, including Play Movies &amp; TV, Google Translate, Fiber TV, Fiber, Google Stadia, Google Authenticator, Google Classroom, Smart Lock, Motion Stills, Onduo for Diabetes, Wear OS by Google and Project Baseline &#8212; but not Google&#8217;s main apps like Search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail or its other productivity apps.</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">announced</a> this week its tracking restrictions for iOS apps are nearing arrival. The changes had initially been pushed back to give developers more time to make updates, but will now arrive in &#8220;early spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once live, the previous opt-out model for sharing your Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) will change to an opt-in model, meaning developers will have to ask users&#8217; permission to track them. Most users will likely say &#8220;no,&#8221; and be annoyed by the request. Users will also be able to adjust IDFA sharing in Settings on a per-app basis, or on all apps at once.</p>

<p>Facebook has already been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-fb-earnings-q4-2020.html">warning investors</a> of the ad revenue hit that will result from these changes, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2">it expects to see</a> in the first quarter earnings. It may also be <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court">preparing a lawsuit</a>. Google, meanwhile, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/27/google-apps-to-stop-using-ad-tracker-highlighted-by-ios-14">said</a> it would be adopting Apple&#8217;s SKAdNetwork framework and providing feedback to Apple about its potential improvements.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has been laying the groundwork to establish itself as the company that cares about consumer privacy. And it&#8217;s certainly true that no other large tech company has yet to give users this much power to fight back against being tracked around the web and inside apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2006406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg 2792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.57.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>But this is not a case of Apple being the &#8220;good guy&#8221; while everyone else is &#8220;bad&#8221; &#8212;  because the multi-billion-dollar ad industry is not that simple. With a change to its software, Apple has effectively carved out a seat at the table for its own benefit.</p>
<p>What many don&#8217;t realize is that Apple watches what its users do across its own platform, inside a number of its first-party apps &#8212; including in Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Books, Apple News and the App Store. It then uses that first-party data to personalize the ads it displays in Apple News, Stocks and the App Store.</p>
<p>So while other businesses are tracking users around the web and apps to gain data that lets them better personalize ads at scale, Apple only tracks users inside its own apps and services. (But there sure are a lot of them! And Apple keeps launching new ones, too.)</p>
<p>With the new limits that impact the effectiveness of ads <em>outside</em> of Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, advertisers who need to reach a potential customer &#8212; say, with an app recommendation &#8212; will need to throw more money into <em>Apple-delivered advertising</em> instead. This is because Apple&#8217;s ads will be capable of making those <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">more targeted, personalized</a> and, therefore, more effective recommendations.</p>
<p>Apple says it will play by the same rules that it&#8217;s asking other developers to abide by. Meaning, if its apps want to track you, they&#8217;ll ask. But most of its apps do not &#8220;track&#8221; using IDFA. Meanwhile, if users want to turn off personalized ads using Apple&#8217;s <em>first</em>-party data, that&#8217;s a different setting. (Settings &#8211;&gt; Privacy &#8211;&gt; scroll to bottom &#8211;&gt; Apple Advertising &#8211;&gt; toggle off Personalized Ads). And no, you won&#8217;t be shown a pop-up asking you if that&#8217;s a setting you want on or off.</p>

<p>Apple, having masterfully made its case as the privacy-focused company &#8212;<em> because wow, isn&#8217;t adtech gross? &#8212;</em>  is now just laying it on. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Apple CEO Tim Cook this week blamed the adtech industry</a> for the growth in online extremism, violent incitement (e.g. at the U.S. Capitol) and growing belief in conspiracies, saying companies (<em>cough, Facebook</em>) optimized for engagement and data collection, no matter the damage to society.</p>

<li><strong>Buzzy voice chat app Clubhouse <a href="https://www.axios.com/clubhouse-andreessen-horowitz-3a10475a-becd-4483-a81e-9ce76d24e85f.html">raises $100 million</a>, valuing the business <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation">at $1 billion.</a></strong> Despite being launched under a year ago and remaining an invite-only experience for the time being, the app has been carving out a new form of audio-based social networking. With now over 180 investors and a pandemic coming to an end &#8212; perhaps &#8212; with the vaccine rollout, Clubhouse will soon have to prove it has value in a reopened world where there&#8217;s more to do, including, once again, networking events and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/clubhouse-app-people-who-miss-conferences/">conferences</a>. It will also eventually have to contend with what sort of app it becomes when it finally opens up to the public. So far, its private, insiders-only atmosphere has given it something of a protected status. Though conversations have turned toxic at times, only a few users ever heard them &#8212; and there&#8217;s no transcript. When the world piles in, however, Clubhouse could not only lose its exclusive appeal but also become host to conversations that do real harm.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India plans to introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in the country and provide a framework for the creation of an official digital currency during the current budget session of parliament.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://loksabhadocs.nic.in/bull2mk/2021/29012021.pdf">agenda</a> (PDF) published on the lower house website, the legislation seeks to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,&#8221; but allow “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology [blockchain] of cryptocurrency and its uses.”</p>
<p>The law also seeks to “create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency” that will be issued by the nation’s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, the agenda said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2018, an Indian government panel recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to 10 years of jail time for offenders. The panel also suggested the government to explore a digital version of the fiat currency and ways to implement it.</p>
<p>At the time, RBI said the move was necessary to curb “ring-fencing” of the country’s financial system. It had also argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currencies as they are not made of metal or exist in physical form, nor were they stamped by the government. The 2018 notice from the central bank sent a panic to several local startups and companies offering services to trade in cryptocurrency. Nearly all of them have either since closed shop, or pivoted to serve other markets.</p>
<p>This proposal was challenged by several exchanges and traders, who filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. The nation’s apex court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/">ruled in their favor last year</a>. This ruling was seen as &#8220;historic&#8221; but it did not impact the earlier circular on the policy level.</p>
<p>“Since the government is considering introducing the bill during this session of Parliament, we are sure the government will definitely listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of CoinDCX,a cryptocurrency exchange in India.</p>
<p>“We are talking to other stakeholders and will definitely initiate deeper dialogue with the government and showcase how we can actually create a healthy ecosystem in unison,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Dublin is a really vibrant startup ecosystem," said Michelle Dervan of Rethink Education Management. "Young population. Lots of government supports to encourage entrepreneurship."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s technology scene has come in leaps and bounds in the last decade, with a growing VC scene, plenty of startups and tech giants attracted by the nation&#8217;s favorable tax incentives and talent pool.</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Slack, Microsoft and Dropbox each have a European headquarters sited in Dublin. As the EU&#8217;s only remaining English-language speaking hub, Ireland is attracting more diversity in its founders than ever before, plus the tech diaspora is returning to its roots as the ecosystem matures.</p>
<p>We surveyed five local VCs to find out if they had any wisdom to share with TechCrunch readers who are considering hiring, investing or founding a company in Ireland this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VCs in Ireland don’t stray far from home, but there are plenty of great deals to be had there anyway. A small domestic market means Irish startups think internationally from launch, and there are high-quality seed opportunities. Top-tier American VCs like Sequoia are placing bets on Irish companies, sometimes even at a pre-seed stage.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has not really impacted many investment strategies — aside from the switch to Zoom calls instead of meet-and-greets — but it has made hiring more challenging, given the competitiveness of the local labor market. Still, top engineering talent is cheaper there than in the U.S., which means entrepreneurs can create great companies with less overhead.</p>

<h2>Andrew O&#8217;Neill, principal, Act Venture Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are seeing high-quality seed opportunities that are leading with exciting developer-first/bottoms-up go-to-market strategies in both security and enterprise software. The shift left in security is very well-publicized, but we feel the cultural element of developers truly caring about security and implementing it at design phase is still only beginning … and it&#8217;s hugely exciting.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a B2B SaaS design tool, in the world of Figma, Sketch and Invision App … and has some very interesting angels. It is only just complete and not announced yet … and we have not talked to any PR agencies yet, but would be happy to pitch an exclusive to you ;)</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
As a domestic market, Ireland is very small … so by its very nature, we do not see the same level of great B2C as the U.K. The expertise … and second, third-time consumer-tech founders are not as common, but there are still of course huge opportunities in the consumer space and companies like Buymie are proving it can be done in Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Like every investment: The people that truly understand the pain point, have passion around the product, have the patience and grit to keep going, and finally the potential for this company to become a category creator.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
No competition means no market … however there are high volumes of startups empowering remote working, productivity tools and HR tech focused around company culture metrics etc. … but that said, there is a wave of change happening around the future of work that no one has a crystal ball on, and new category winners will still emerge.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Very focused on Ireland and more than 50% … we can invest in Series A and B across Europe, but we invest at seed exclusively in Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Enterprise software startups have always been well-positioned for success within Ireland, and that has only increased with the secondary effects now appearing from the result of great talent coming out of large MNCs driven by 20+ years of FDI. Act has invested in over 120 companies and over half is in enterprise software. We are excited about seeing a new emerging amount of repeat founders in our portfolio (and Ireland) like Barry Lunn in Provizio, and Cathal McGloin in ServisBOT.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
When we looked at all the data in Ireland recently, there has been a 115% increase from €401 million to €860 million invested per annum over the last four years. So the market size has doubled and we are seeing some very exciting seed companies, which bides very well for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Personally, I do expect to see even more great startups coming out of the south like Cork and Limerick and the west in Galway, but I don&#8217;t foresee startup hubs significantly losing people due to the pandemic and remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? </strong><br />
It&#8217;s obvious that there are now serious questions around the level of future of business travel, given how people have been forced to rethink and adapt how they do business. This industry shift alone will create both big winners and losers long term.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not hugely, given the long-term timeframe we consider when investing. The bigger question around changing consumer behaviors, the acceleration of e-commerce adoption and digital transformation is something we are of course taking into account. Our advice is always bespoke and contextual to the individual startup, and only given when asked.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, our portfolio has proven itself to be quite robust through COVID and companies like SilverCloud Health, Toothpic and Buymie are experiencing great tailwinds due to the current pandemic environment.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Personally, seeing some incredibly talented founders with deep expertise at seed stage that are repeat founders. They know exactly what they want and need to do to go bigger this time around, and we believe they can get there much quicker than before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Isabelle O&#8217;Keeffe, principal, Sure Valley Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
AI/ML, cybersecurity, immersive technologies and gaming infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Getvisbility and Volograms.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Companies that are really creating defensibility using the technology. Companies creating new markets.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Ride-sharing, on-demand delivery, payments and challenger banks.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We invest more than 50% in our local ecosystem versus other startup hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The industries that will continue to thrive include: financial services, property and construction, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and Big Tech. We&#8217;re very excited about some of our portfolio companies including VividQ, Admix, Buymie, Nova Leah and WarDucks.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Dublin and Ireland have a growing and prosperous tech ecosystem and there are plenty of great investment opportunities there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes I would agree that we will see some of this happening. However, I do think that once there is a vaccine that we will see the return of cities and people will naturally be attracted back there.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We have seen limited impact of COVID on some of segments that we invest into. The opportunities exist for companies operating in the future or work including remote working, e-commerce, on-demand grocery delivery, cybersecurity, gaming and immersive technologies.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID has not really impacted our investment strategy bar the fact that we have had to get comfortable with a lot of the process being conducted via Zoom. We have not shifted away from certain sectors or industries as we have tended to invest into areas that are relatively unaffected. The biggest worries for founders in our portfolio are around raising their next round of funding, hitting key milestones, achieving a repeatable go-to-market strategy and hiring great talent.</p>
<p>My advice to startups in my portfolio now is to keep a very close eye on burn, ensure that if they are going out to fundraise that they realize it can take at least two months longer than they originally anticipated and to continue to be working on the product and technology at times when sales have slowed down as when they emerge from this period they will be in a much stronger position with their products and technology and the sales will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes we have &#8220;green shoots&#8217; regarding momentum in Buymie, which is an &#8220;on-demand grocery delivery&#8221; company who have seen a surge in demand for the service due to the pandemic. Getvisibility, which is a cybersecurity company, has also seen a surge in interest from companies in the financial services, and pharmaceutical and defense industries as they adapt to their employees working from home and where there are greater risks of cyberattacks.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I think the moment for everyone recently has been the announcement that we could be closer to a vaccine than we originally thought and that we may be able to resume normal life next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nicola McClafferty, partner, Draper Esprit</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Future of work/consumerization of enterprise, machine-learning applications.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Sweepr — automation of customer care for connected homes.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
True AI, digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Global ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
E-scooters.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
~20%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Software application, AI, machine learning, life sciences. key companies, WorkVivo, Manna Aero, Open, Sweepr, Roomex and Evervault.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Unfortunately seed stage is dramatically underserved by local players. Hiring can be challenging given competitiveness of labor market with large tech MNCs. However deep entrepreneurship culture, global thinking from day one, incredibly strong pool of technical talent from Irish universities. It&#8217;s also a key destination of other European founders. Brexit opens even more opportunity for this.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Startup economy will likely become a bit more distributed around the country but this will be a positive. Cities like Dublin, Cork and Galway will however remain strong hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel tech extremely challenged but the best companies will survive and huge winners will emerge in the COVID recovery when travel returns. Big opportunity to accelerate enterprise SaaS adoption and automation as budgets have shifted dramatically to digital infrastructure and cost-cutting and productivity becomes key focus.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Strategy remains largely intact with some further reserves used to support companies. For those businesses very directly impacted (e.g., travel) — concern is visibility and timing of recovery that is largely out of founder control. Other concerns include cash runway in times of uncertainty — how will the market view performance for future fundraise; in big enterprise how to adapt your sales model for a remote world.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Most definitely. As tech businesses most have been very adaptable and are responding to customer needs as they change. After a slow Q2 many businesses rebounded very well in Q3 and have returned to strong growth. Early churn has been flushed out already.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Announcement of the vaccine! Path to recovery is nearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Michelle Dervan, partner, Rethink Education Management, LLC</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I am deeply specialized in education technology investing. Interested in seeing tailored Zoom alternatives for the classroom, tech-enabled vocational training programs, corporate learning solutions for the distributed workforce.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Crehana, an online skills training platform serving Latin America.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Upskilling and reskilling programs for displaced workers.<br />
Shorter, cheaper training programs and credentialing for middle-skills jobs.<br />
Software to help high school students prep for college and career.<br />
Effective remediation programs that can help students catch up on lost learning during COVID.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Outliers in terms of evidence of product market fit, proof of efficacy, impact baked into the business model, team with unique understanding of the problem and ability to execute against it.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
K-12 supplemental apps, games, content.<br />
Tech bootcamps.<br />
Corporate LMS.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
80% U.S.-focused, 20% outside of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Ireland has traditionally had a very strong e-learning/edtech startup sector. Exciting growth companies include LearnIpon, Learnosity, Alison, Touch Press. Early-stage companies include Avail Support, Zhrum, Robotify.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Dublin is a really vibrant startup ecosystem. Young population. Lots of government supports to encourage entrepreneurship. Excellent experienced talent pool coming out of multinationals and existing startups. English speaking. Great connectivity to rest of Europe/U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I recently relocated to Dublin after 10 years in NYC. There has been a mass exodus from cities like NYC and SF during the pandemic as the economics of living there plus the space constraints, etc. no longer make sense in a prolonged period of WFH and while most amenities are closed. Dublin is also a high-cost location so will likely also see some exodus although I think to a lesser extent.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? </strong><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The COVID environment has caused a mass acceleration in the adoption of education technology across all age groups from K-12, higher education to corporate and workforce learning. This was already a secular trend albeit at a much slower pace of adoption. I believe that the prolonged period of reliance on a tech-enabled learning experience and the potential need to revert to this in the future will have a lasting effect on how we teach and learn.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy has not been impacted by COVID. We are seeing a greater degree of opportunity and interest in our sector. The biggest concerns for founders are unpredictability in the sales funnel, potential delays to purchasing decisions and resultant cashflow implications. Even for companies that have been net beneficiaries of the COVID environment, it has injected a very high degree of unpredictability and that is very stressful for founders.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, as mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Biden&#8217;s election and the list of people that he is evaluating for Education Secretary and for his cabinet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Will Prendergast, partner, Frontline Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We take an opportunistic approach to investing at Frontline and are open to any number of different trends within the B2B space. Generally, we are excited to back founders working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complexity in the software/product development stack: As more and more businesses become software businesses and software products become more complex there will be a layer of tools that abstract away that complexity and provide connections between them. Software using other software will be an exciting space in the decade to come, facilitated by many API-first companies.</li>
<li>Embedded finance: We are excited by fintechs that are helping non-financial institutions leverage their customer base to provide financial products. Open banking is an enormous enabler of embedded finance.</li>
<li>Process augmentation rather than process automation: There are a number of key skill gaps emerging in many different sectors right now and software is emerging as the bridge for companies to handle the shortfall. These are products that help highly skilled workers maximize their productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the current environment, we are also highly interested in startups that are broadly targeting the key trends below brought on by COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitals and clinics seek to increase efficiency and reach patients remotely.</li>
<li>Banks cautious as financial crime grows.</li>
<li>Remote employee management tools for HR and finance teams.</li>
<li>Debt collection automation due to SME liquidations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We recently invested in a German business that aims to become the Moody’s of financial crime.<br />
Since 2008, large banks have become less willing to transact with regional retail banks. They were unfairly deemed &#8220;too risky&#8221; in their portfolio. This company aims to create a fundamental shift in the industry — from old school box ticking compliance to data-driven ways of determining the risk. We are very excited to increase fairness and transparency between banks, which will inevitably create more value to the end consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
B2B payments are undergoing a renaissance at the moment with companies like Bill.com dominating in the public markets. As fintech creeps into more aspects of the product stack, payments is just the first part to produce huge winners. Solving the nuts and bolts of business finance is still a hugely overlooked opportunity for both large and small companies.<br />
We’d also love to see more companies dedicated to reducing the CFO burden at SME and enterprise level. From real-time payroll to treasury and employee pension management, so much of a CFO’s work is manual and time consuming.<br />
We have supported companies that make a significant dent in the specific parts of the funnel (for example, Payslip — a global payroll automation platform), but we feel like there is more room for end-to-end automation in this realm.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We’re looking for challengers who seek out other strong minds; whether you’re a first-time founder building something that matters, or a seasoned entrepreneur that knows how hard it is to “make it.” In all of our investments, we prize self-awareness above all else in our founders; key to building great teams and scaling a global business. Ambition does not require experience. We’re looking to invest in pioneers across Europe from the world of tech, computer science and engineering, due to our own deep knowledge of technology. In return, we use our personal experience in building and scaling business across both sides of the Atlantic to help founders get off the ground — and go global.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Products that are being built specifically with the conditions created by COVID-19 today may find themselves in a wildly different environment in 18 months. We’re looking to speak to founders who see how things are now and have a strong opinion on how they’re going to affect things in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We support founders with global ambition across both sides of the Atlantic. Frontline Seed is a pan-European early-stage fund investing all across Europe. Frontline X is a growth-stage fund, for fast and frictionless U.S.-Europe expansion.<br />
When we first started Frontline, the vast majority of our investments came out of Ireland. Since 2012 we have expanded our scope, and for the last few years have been very much pan-European and now invest across Ireland, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Southern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
U.S. tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Zendesk Hubspot (among many others) have a &#8220;pied-à-terre&#8221; in Ireland.<br />
In most cases, top-class engineering talent is sourced more cheaply there than in the U.S., creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They upskill great engineers, who then go on to create great companies.<br />
We’ve seen startup developer tools thrive in Ireland as a result; an example of which is Tines.io. This Accel-and-Index-backed company was built by the world-renowned security team in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Ireland is a hidden gem — we’ve had the privilege of reaping the rewards. However, I suspect that the likes of Tines.io, Intercom and Stripe are stirring investor curiosity.<br />
We’re already seeing top-tier U.S. VCs like Sequoia placing bets in Irish companies at a pre-seed stage, for example Evervault, one of our portfolio companies.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
As a global fund, part of our core belief is that great companies and exceptional founders can come from anywhere in the world. COVID-19 has had a significant and eroding effect on traditional “tech hub” models and we have seen founders of all walks of life realize that companies can not only run, but thrive in a remote world.<br />
That said, we also believe that geography will continue to matter. Where you set up your HQ in Europe as a growth-stage B2B SaaS business expanding from the U.S. (for example) will continue to matter in a post-COVID world — because legal entities will continue to matter.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The closure of retail stores = tremendous growth in e-commerce. Companies big and small are vamping up their back and front ends, and attempting to get more visibility on their supply chain for better customer service.</li>
<li>Payments transition online = more financial crime. Banks need tools that help them detect fraud.</li>
<li>Consumers are tight on cash = HR departments want to provide more salary liquidity and help employees save for their pensions to create better financial wellness.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not changed our investment strategy but it will have lasting impact on the way businesses are run and built. That said, the pandemic has given us a new filter: &#8220;How successful can this product/business model be in a post-COVID world?&#8221;<br />
At the moment, our founders are most worried by engagement (maintaining company culture) and talent (team expansion, senior leadership recruitment).<br />
Every company is different and we shy away from blanket statements, but what we do advise is that founders spend time to identify what working format works best for their company and that they listen carefully to their employees. How can you continue to grow your business, whilst maintaining and nurturing an inclusive and engaged company culture?<br />
Also — while you can, shore up your balance sheet. Believe it or not, VC funding was at an all-time high in Europe last quarter. Go fundraise to extend your runway as much as possible. No one really knows what the next 12 months is really going to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Three companies in our portfolio stand out as pandemic green shoots:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.science-inc.com/">Science Inc</a>, the 10-year-old, L.A.-based incubator and venture firm, rolled out a blank-check company onto the Nasdaq, raising $310.5 million for what firm founders Peter Pham and Mike Jones say will be used to take public a company in the mobile, entertainment or direct-to-consumer service space.</p>
<p>If they have one of their own portfolio companies in mind to take public, they wouldn&#8217;t say in conversation yesterday. Yet Science would have some interesting candidates from which to choose if so. It helped incubate the <a href="https://dot.la/playvs-raises-10-5m-making-esports-varsity-sports-2649035403.html">amateur esports platform</a> PlayVS after Pham met its founder, Delane Parnell, on a dance floor at a South by Southwest festival. It&#8217;s also an investor in Bird, the micro-mobility company that is reportedly working with Credit Suisse to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac">strike a deal</a> with a blank-check company. And it helped create and grow Liquid Death, a company with a tongue-in-cheek marketing strategy that&#8217;s selling mountain water in aluminum cans &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/the-joke-is-on-consumers-as-liquid-death-raises-23-million-more/">a lot of it</a>, says Pham.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so silly. Water is the top-selling packaged drink in the U.S. and has been since 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, we spent much of our time with the duo talking about how to create a powerful consumer brand in 2021, no matter the category. You can <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7569451">listen</a> to that full conversation, or check out excerpts of much of our chat below, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have this new blank-check company. You&#8217;re about to start talking with potential targets. Will you consider a company that you&#8217;ve incubated or else funded at Science?</strong></p>
<p>MJ: No. So the SPAC is an independent entity. We think that there&#8217;s a universe of well over 100 companies that would fit the credentials of what we&#8217;re looking for within the stack. Some of those companies, we may or may not have investment exposure [to them], but the process of analysis is independent of the Science portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you wouldn&#8217;t rule it out.</strong></p>
<p>MJ: We have independent directors. So there&#8217;s a different process that would go through if we were looking at a company in the portfolio. But right now we&#8217;re just aggregating the right universe of potential targets. And then we&#8217;ll go through a formal process on it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are the metrics you want to see? You are specialists, including in direct-to-consumer companies. Do the companies that you&#8217;re targeting have to be profitable?</strong></p>
<p>MJ: When we look at the different, potential companies that we&#8217;re interested in, we&#8217;re not saying that they have to have some specific level of profitability or specific level of revenue . . . We don&#8217;t expose the the core metrics and revenue drivers that we think make for successful companies within sectors. But we&#8217;re a super data-focused team. We&#8217;re very much on the forefront of next-generation Gen Z and millennial-oriented marketing. And there are very specific things we look for that we think may build breakout brands.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Both of you know the social media space. There are new social media plays that are gaining a lot of attention, such as Clubhouse. Back to your core business at Science, are there any investments in those areas in that area that you&#8217;re looking at?</strong></p>
<p>PP: A decade ago is when YouTube became a platform for marketing. Then six of seven years ago, Instagram [became a platform for marketing]. And then Snapchat came along, and then all of a sudden Instagram stories [emerged], and then TikTok and now another platform, which is Clubhouse. There&#8217;s always something new coming around the corner.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t take your eye off of Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, but Clubhouse is real. It&#8217;s almost radio, but it&#8217;s participatory. If you go to South by Southwest, it&#8217;s almost like SWSX panels around the clock. There&#8217;s this really interesting dynamic where you could be in crowd, raise your hand, and if they pull you up on stage, now you&#8217;re part of the panel. That&#8217;s why a lot of people are there &#8212; for the chance of getting discovered [and] the chance of letting their voice be heard by a larger audience.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What makes you think its growth is sustainable?</strong></p>
<p>PP: The moment marketers join a platform [you know]. When real marketers, people who are selling classes on how to make money, how to have real estate, how to make money [selling] real estate, that type of marketing &#8212; when [they show up], it&#8217;s an arbitrage. It&#8217;s basically very smart people who make a lot of money realizing for that every minute they spend doing this, it&#8217;s more valuable in terms of ROI, customer acquisition cost, and revenue, than spending time on this other thing that everyone else is on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do your portfolio companies use these platforms in 2021? You are investors in Liquid Death. You helped incubate MeUndies, a subscription underwear company that raised saw <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2020/nov/30/meundies-secures-40-million-investment-provenance/">$40 million</a> late last year. You were involved in the early days of Dollar Shave Club. How do you break through the noise with things like water, underwear and razors?</strong></p>
<p>PP: Platforms are always just a springboard. You can&#8217;t rely on these places long term because the rules of the game change, the feed changes. Ten years ago, when we launched Dollar Shave Club, we had on the homepage an autoplay of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI">YouTube video</a> that was just about driving customers to buy something. At the time, no one thought about posting YouTube videos to get somebody to buy something. MeUndies [used] Instagram. Who would imagine subscription underwear? But every month, there&#8217;s a holiday &#8212; Christmas, New Year&#8217;s, Valentine&#8217;s Day, St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. What if there was something interesting and fun that you could wear?</p>
<p>With Liquid Death, it&#8217;s still very much [focused on] Instagram and now probably TikTok. But in all cases, the brand has to be worthy for somebody to talk about what&#8217;s interesting about it and even to defend it.</p>
<p>Mike underplays our data side, but we measure incessantly everything that&#8217;s happening in terms of the each one of our businesses, including their social reach, their engagements, business retention, how often customers are coming back, how much revenue we&#8217;re generating from each individual, what each piece of marketing is worth. All of these tie into this complex engine that [helps us determine], is there a business behind this thing? Can it grow on its own without a reliance on Facebook? With most companies, if you don&#8217;t understand how to build your own community, your own brand, and your own audience, ultimately the winner on the back end is Google or Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you build that community right now?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve handed out 4,000 cans personally. In the early days of Liquid Death, I just remember handing it to a bunch of teenagers, and six out of 10 would take a photo and Snap it to their friend. It was just this instant moment I kept seeing over and over, and I just knew, this is gonna work. If you noticed in March and April and May how boring your Instagram feed was, [it was] because everyone was staying home and there was nothing to do. But we [had this insight to] give somebody a piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Liquid Death is now available in some stores, including 7-Elevens. Are people buying the water online? What percentage of them buy it through a subscription?</strong></p>
<p>PP: One third of our customers who buy online [at the site] buy merchandise. They&#8217;re buying $24 hats, $45 hoodies &#8212; we&#8217;re selling out merch constantly. It&#8217;s the brand, it&#8217;s a lifestyle. Mike Cessario, the CEO, says he&#8217;s building something that&#8217;s like your favorite band. The product lets you be a fan of the thing [including] because it&#8217;s not a piece of plastic that&#8217;s going to go the ocean [like other water bottles]. It&#8217;s not sugar. It&#8217;s not alcohol that might result in a drunk driving incident.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s flair. It&#8217;s a reason to say hi to somebody. It&#8217;s an icebreaker. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s irreverent. It&#8217;s dumb. It&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s everything to everybody, but something worthy to talk about, something to look at.</p>
<p>The trajectory we&#8217;re on is hard to measure, You have to see it, and when you see it over and over, it&#8217;s obvious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood has <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/">detailed</a> its latest step in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">complex quagmire of market manipulation</a> that is this week&#8217;s GameStop hedge fund Reddit army debacle. Users will for the present be limited to holding a single share of GameStop and dozens of other stocks.</p>
<p>Several stocks were limited to five shares, and options contracts are likewise limited on many of the most-traded stocks this week, such as AMC and Blackberry. Positions exceeding these amounts will not be automatically sold, but they will apply if the user goes under them and tries to buy again. Fractional shares are also prohibited.</p>
<p>Any other specifics about positions, expiring options contracts and so on can be found in the announcement and related FAQs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robinhood has said that it has halted and now limited trading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">because of &#8220;financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits&#8221;</a> — essentially, the volume and value of the trading going on was beyond its ability to legally or realistically cover. Trading of certain stocks was halted or restricted earlier this week, but the new post details exactly which stocks are affected and how.</p>

<p>The company had to hastily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">raise funds totaling over a billion dollars</a> from its existing investors after reportedly maxing out half a billion in credit lines.</p>
<p>With widespread outrage at the handling of the situation and the U.S. government taking notice, it&#8217;s unlikely Robinhood&#8217;s troubles (not to mention other trading apps and platforms) are anywhere near over. With new developments appearing seemingly every few hours, it&#8217;s hard to know how this particular story will develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech is so widespread, we already need more consumer-friendly nomenclature to describe the products, services and tools it encompasses.</p>
<p>I know someone who reads stories to their grandchildren on two continents via Zoom each weekend. Is that &#8220;edtech?&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, many Netflix subscribers sought out online chess instructors after watching &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit,&#8221; but I doubt if they all ran searches for &#8220;remote learning&#8221; first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Edtech needs to reach beyond underfunded public school systems to become more sustainable, which is why more investors and founders are focusing on lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Besides serving traditional students with field trips and art classes, a maturing sector is now branching out to offer software tutors, cooking classes and singing lessons.</p>
<p>For our latest investor survey, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">Natasha Mascarenhas polled 13 edtech VCs</a> to learn more about how &#8220;employer-led up-skilling and a renewed interest in self-improvement&#8221; is expanding the sector&#8217;s TAM.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who she spoke to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deborah Quazzo</strong>, managing partner, GSV Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Bittner</strong>, founding partner, Firework Ventures (a future of work fund with portfolio companies LearnIn and TransfrVR)</li>
<li><strong>Jomayra Herrera</strong>, principal, Cowboy Ventures (a generalist fund with portfolio companies Hone and Guild Education)</li>
<li><strong>John Danner</strong>, managing partner, Dunce Capital (an edtech and future of work fund with portfolio companies Lambda School and Outschool)</li>
<li><strong>Mercedes Bent and Bradley Twohig</strong>, partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners (a multistage generalist fund with investments including Forage, Clever and Outschool)</li>
<li><strong>Ian Chiu</strong>, managing director, Owl Ventures (a large edtech-focused fund backing highly valued companies including Byju’s, Newsela and Masterclass)</li>
<li><strong>Jan Lynn-Matern</strong>, founder and partner, Emerge Education (a leading edtech seed fund in Europe with portfolio companies like Aula, Unibuddy and BibliU)</li>
<li><strong>Benoit Wirz</strong>, partner, Brighteye Ventures (an active edtech-focused venture capital fund in Europe that backs YouSchool, Lightneer and Aula)</li>
<li><strong>Charles Birnbaum</strong>, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners (a generalist fund with portfolio companies including Guild Education and Brightwheel)</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Pianko</strong>, co-founder and managing director, University Ventures (a higher ed and future of work fund that is backing Imbellus and Admithub)</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca Kaden</strong>, managing partner, Union Square Ventures (a generalist fund with portfolio companies including TopHat, Quizlet, Duolingo)</li>
<li><strong>Andreata Muforo</strong>, partner, TLCom Capital (a generalist fund backing uLesson)</li>

<p>After falling into yesterday&#8217;s wild news cycle, Alex Wilhelm returned to The Exchange this morning with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">a close look at venture capital activity across Africa</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparing aggregate 2020 figures to 2019 results, it appears that last year was a somewhat robust year for African startups, albeit one with fewer large rounds,&#8221; he found.</p>
<p>For more context, he interviewed Dario Giuliani, the director of research firm Briter Bridges, which focuses on emerging markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>

<p>New cybersecurity ecosystems are popping up in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Some of of that growth has been fueled by an exodus from the Bay Area, but many early-stage security startups already have deep roots in East Coast cities like Boston and New York.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom and Europe, government innovation programs have helped entrepreneurs close higher numbers of Series A and B rounds.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s smartphones are unfathomably feature-rich and durable, so it&#8217;s logical that sales have slowed.</p>
<p>A phone purchased 18 months ago is probably &#8220;good enough&#8221; for many consumers, especially in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Then again, of the record $111.4 billion in revenue Apple earned last quarter, $65.68 billion came from phone sales, largely driven by the release of the iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Even though &#8220;Apple’s success this quarter was kind of a perfect storm,&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/chasing-the-cybersecurity-investment-opportunity/"> writes Hardware Editor Brian Heater</a>, &#8220;it’s safe to project a rebound for the industry at large in 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finmark co-founder and CEO Rami Essaid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder/">wrote a post for Extra Crunch</a> that candidly describes the traps he laid for himself that made him a less-effective entrepreneur.</p>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s worked closely with founders at several startups, each of the points he raised resonated deeply with me.</p>
<p>In my experience, many founders have a hard time delegating, which can quickly create cultural and operational problems. Rami&#8217;s experience bears this out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the pandemic disrupted the social rhythms of work and school, many of us have compensated by changing our relationship to digital media.</p>
<p>For instance, I purchased a new sofa and thicker living room curtains several months ago when I realized we have no idea when movie theaters will reopen.</p>
<p>Last year, podcast sponsors spent almost $800 million to reach listeners, but ad revenue is estimated to surpass $1 billion this year. Clearly, I&#8217;m not the only person who used a discount code to buy a new product in 2020.</p>
<p>At this point, I can scarcely keep track of the multiple streaming platforms I&#8217;m subscribed to, but a new voice-activated remote control that comes with my basic cable plan makes it easier to browse my options.</p>
<p>Media reporter Anthony Ha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/">spoke to10 VCs who invest in media startups</a> to learn more about where they see digital media heading in the months ahead. For starters, how much longer can we expect traditional advertising models to persist?</p>
<p>And in a world with hundreds of channels, how are creators supposed to compete for our attention? What sort of discovery tools can we expect to help us navigate between a police procedural set in a Scandinavian village and a 90s sitcom reboot?</p>
<p>Here’s who Anthony interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel Gulati</strong>, founding partner, Forecast Fund</li>
<li><strong>Alex Gurevich</strong>, managing director, Javelin Venture Partners</li>
<li><strong>Matthew Hartman</strong>, partner, Betaworks Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Jerry Lu</strong>, senior associate, Maveron</li>
<li><strong>Jana Messerschmidt</strong>, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners</li>
<li><strong>Michael Palank</strong>, general partner, MaC Venture Capital (with additional commentary from MaC’s Marlon Nichols)</li>
<li><strong>Pär-Jörgen Pärson</strong>, general partner, Northzone</li>
<li><strong>M.G. Siegler</strong>, general partner, GV</li>
<li><strong>Laurel Touby</strong>, managing director, Supernode Ventures</li>
<li><strong>Hans Tung</strong>, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, we list each investor&#8217;s responses separately, but for this survey, we grouped their responses by question. Some readers say they use our surveys to study up on an individual VC before pitching them, so let us know which format you prefer.</p>

<p>Data analytics platform Databricks is reportedly raising new capital that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/does-a-27-or-29-billion-valuation-make-sense-for-databricks/">could value the company between $27 billion and $29 billion</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of Q3 2020, Databricks had surpassed a $350 million run rate — a $150 million YoY increase, reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>At the time, he described the company as &#8220;an obvious IPO candidate&#8221; with &#8220;broad private-market options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which begs the question: &#8220;Can we come up with a set of numbers that help make sense of Databricks at $27 billion?&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/end-to-end-operators-are-the-next-generation-of-consumer-business/">End-to-end operators</a> like Netflix, Peloton and Lemonade take a lot of time and energy to reach scale, but &#8220;the additional capital required is often outweighed by the value captured from owning the entire experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>On January 25, Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted that he was making two blank-check deals.</p>
<p>Enterprise SaaS company Latch makes keyless entry systems; Sunlight Financial helps consumers finance residential solar power installations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are nearly 300 SPACs in the market today looking for deals,&#8221; noted Alex Wilhelm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">who unpacked both transactions</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months.&#8221;</p>

<p>For four years running, the S&amp;P 500 and incumbent financial services companies have been outperformed by companies like Afterpay, Square and Bill.com.</p>
<p>In light of steady VC investment, increasing consumer adoption and a crowded IPO pipeline, &#8220;fintech represents one of the most exciting major innovation cycles of this decade.&#8221;</p>

<p>On January 15, 2001, then-college student Dries Buytaert released Drupal 1.0.0, an open-source content-management platform. At the time, about 7% of the world&#8217;s population was online.</p>
<p>After raising more than $180 million, Buytaert exited to Vista Equity Partners for $1 billion in 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/drupals-journey-from-dorm-room-project-to-billion-dollar-exit/">Enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed Buytaert</a> to learn more about his 18-year journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;His story is compelling, but it also offers lessons for startup founders who also want to build something big,&#8221; says Ron.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Roblox eyes what could be a historic debut on public markets in the coming months, investors who have </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued the company at $29.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are certainly eyeing the gaming company&#8217;s dedicated and youthful user base &#8212; but it&#8217;s the 7 million active creators and developers on the Roblox platform that they are likely most impressed by. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, Roblox has been running an accelerator program focused on enabling the next generation of game developers to be successful on its platform. Over the years, the program has expanded from one annual class to now three, each with around 40 developers participating. That means more than 100 developers per year are working directly with Roblox to gain mentorship, education and funding opportunities to get their games off the ground.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company’s efforts on this front have grown more formalized, Roblox in 2018 hired former Accelerator alumni Christian Hunter, a Roblox gamer since age 10 and game developer since 13, to run the program full time. Having been through the experience himself, Hunter brought to the program an understanding of how the Accelerator could improve, based on a developer’s own perspective. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the COVID-19 pandemic threw into disarray the company’s plans to run the program. Instead of being able to invite developers to spend three months participating in classes hosted at Roblox’s San Mateo office, the company had to revamp the program for remote participation. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Roblox raises at $29.5 billion valuation, readies for direct listing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/embed/#?secret=bkjbsXR6M8" data-secret="bkjbsXR6M8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, developers who were used to playing and building games taking place in virtual worlds quickly adjusted to the new online experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before COVID, everyone was together. It was easier to talk to people. [Developers] could just walk up to someone that was on our product or engineering team if they were running into issues,” explains Roblox Senior Product Manager Rebecca Crose. “But obviously, with COVID-19, we had to switch and think differently.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remote program, though differently structured, offered several benefits. Developers could join the program’s Discord server to talk to both current participants and previous classes, and reach out and ask questions. They could also participate in the Roblox company Slack to ask the team questions, and there were more playtests being scheduled to gain reactions and feedback from Roblox employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, to get to know one another when they couldn’t meet in person, developers would have game nights where they’d play each other’s games or others that were popular on Roblox, and bond within the virtual environment instead of in face-to-face meetings and classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual Accelerator content, however, remained fairly consistent during the remote experience. Participants had weekly standups, talks on topics like game design and production, and weekly feedback sessions where they asked Roblox engineers questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by its nature, a remote Accelerator broadened who could attend. Instead of limiting the program to only those who could travel to San Mateo and stay for three months, the program was opened up to a more global and diverse audience. This drove increased demand, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 program saw Roblox receiving the largest number of applications ever &#8212; five times the usual number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the class included participants from five countries: The Philippines, South Korea, Sweden, Canada and the U.S. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers at IndieBox Studios saw the program as a chance to double down on their game development side hustles. The young friends spread across the U.K. and Kentucky spent their time during the accelerator scaling up their photorealistic title called </span><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4011063766/Tank-Warfare"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tank Warfare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually never once met in real life, like, we&#8217;ve been friends for going on, what, nine years now,&#8221; Michael Southern tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We met on Roblox.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IndieBox is representative of many of Roblox&#8217;s early developer teams &#8212; younger gamers that have spent more than a decade learning the ins and outs of the evolving Roblox gaming platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all joined Roblox way back in 2008,&#8221; IndieBox&#8217;s Frank Garrison says. &#8220;But we only started developing on the platform in 2019. And for us, the decision to choose Roblox was more down to like, well it&#8217;s what we know, why not give it a bash?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demographics of the accelerator have been shifting in other ways as the developer base grows more diverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would say, in the beginning, it was mostly young males. But as we’ve watched the program evolve, we’ve been getting so many new interesting teams,” notes Program Manager Christian Hunter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 program had more women participants than ever, for example, with 12 in a class of 50. And one team was all women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The age of participants, who are typically in the 18 to 22-year-old range, also evolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen a lot more older folks,” Hunter says. “With [the COVID-19 pandemic], we actually saw our first 50-year-old in the program. We’ve never had anyone older than, I’d say, 24. And in 2020, we had 12 individuals over the age of 30,” he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the teams were also a combination of a kid and a parent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon Clemens learned about the Roblox platform from her son Nathan, learning to code and bringing her husband Jeff in to form a studio called Simple Games. Nathan&#8217;s two sisters help the studio part time, as well as his friend Adrian Holgate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing [my son&#8217;s] experience on Roblox getting involved with the platform, I thought it would be neat to learn how to make our own games,&#8221; Shannon Clemens told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their title </span><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5665787539/Perks-Gods-Of-Glory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gods of Glory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has received more than 13.5 million visits from Roblox players since launching in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our whole family is kind of creatively bent towards having fun with games and coming up with things like that,&#8221; Jeff Clemens tells us. &#8220;Why would we not try this? So, that&#8217;s when we applied to the program and said, &#8216;well, we&#8217;ll try and see if we get accepted,&#8217; and we did and it&#8217;s been awesome.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the changes facilitated by a remote environment, Roblox notes there were other perks enabled by remote learning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one thing, the developers didn’t have to wake up so early to benefit from the experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With it being remote, the developers were working </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hours,” says Crose. “As a developer, we tend to work later and stay up at night. Having them come in at 9 AM sharp was very difficult. It was hard for them because they’re just like&#8230;a zombie. So we definitely saw that by letting them work their own hours, [there is] less burnout and they increase their productivity,” she says. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the COVID-19 crisis may eventually end as the world gets vaccinated, the learnings from the Accelerator and the remote advantages it offers will continue. Developers from the program hope that the growth seen on gaming platforms like Roblox continues as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pandemic has been great for most game studios,&#8221; developer Gustav Linde tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Obviously, it&#8217;s a very weird time, but the timing was good for us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gang Stockholm, a Swedish game development studio co-founded by Linde, has been building experiences &#8212; largely branded ones for clients, exclusively on the Roblox platform. The team of 12 has used the accelerator to slow down development deadlines and dig into some unique areas of the platform as well as focus wholly on their upcoming title, Bloxymon, which they plan to release this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at Steam and the App Store and Google Play, those markets are extremely crowded, and Roblox is a very exciting platform for developers right now,” said Linde. &#8220;Roblox is also getting a lot of attention and a lot of big brands are interested in entering the platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roblox says that going forward, future Accelerator programs will feature a remote element inspired by the COVID experience. The company plans to continue to make its program globally available, with the limitation for now, of English-speaking participants. But it’s looking to expand to reach non-English speakers with future programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fall 2020 Accelerator class graduated in December 2020, and the next spring class will start in February 2021. Roblox says they are already in the process of recruiting for their summer 2021 class, which will again have some 40 participants. Roblox will again aim to continue diversifying the group of creators.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software buying has evolved. The days of executives choosing software for their employees based on IT compatibility or KPIs are gone. Employees now tell their boss what to buy. This is why we’re seeing more and more SaaS companies — Datadog, Twilio, AWS, Snowflake and Stripe, to name a few — find success with a usage-based pricing model.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The usage-based model allows a customer to start at a low cost, while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The usage-based model allows a customer to start at a low cost, minimizing friction to getting started while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time because the price is directly tied with the value a customer receives. Not limiting the number of users who can access the software, customers are able to find new use cases — which leads to more long-term success and higher lifetime value.</p>
<p>While we aren’t going 100% usage-based overnight, looking at some of the megatrends in software —  automation, AI and APIs — the value of a product normally doesn’t scale with more logins. Usage-based pricing will be the key to successful monetization in the future. Here are four top tips to help companies scale to $100+ million ARR with this model.</p>
<h2>1. Land-and-expand is real</h2>
<p>Usage-based pricing is in all layers of the tech stack. Though it was pioneered in the infrastructure layer (think: AWS and Azure), it’s becoming increasingly popular for API-based products and application software — across infrastructure, middleware and applications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106114" style="width: 1532px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106114" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2106114 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg" alt="API-based products and appliacation software – across infrastructure, middleware and applications." width="1522" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg 1522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=768,335 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=680,297 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1522px) 100vw, 1522px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyle Poyar / OpenView</p></div></p>
<p>Some fear that investors will hate usage-based pricing because customers aren’t locked into a subscription. But, investors actually see it as a sign that customers are seeing value from a product and there’s no shelf-ware.</p>
<p>In fact, investors are increasingly rewarding usage-based companies in the market. Usage-based companies are trading at a 50% revenue multiple premium over their peers.</p>
<p>Investors especially love how the usage-based pricing model pairs with the land-and-expand business model. And of the IPOs over the last three years, seven of the nine that had the best net dollar retention all have a usage-based model. Snowflake in particular is off the charts with a 158% net dollar retention.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Dyatlov Pass incident is the mother of all cold cases: nine people found dead in 1959, deep in the Ural mountains, under circumstances no one has ever been able to satisfactorily explain. But new research uses simulation techniques from multiple eras to advance what is perhaps the least implausible story of this tragic mystery.</p>
<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-00081-8/">published yesterday in Nature Communications Earth and Environment</a>, was accompanied by a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2021/01/has-science-solved-history-greatest-adventure-mystery-dyatlov/">highly readable summary in National Geographic</a>, which is very much worth your time. (Even if the headline is the dreaded &#8220;Has science solved&#8230;?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Essentially the mystery is this: The eight students and their ski instructor had pitched their tent on a slope that seemed safe — if not perfectly so then comparatively considering the surroundings at <span class="clearfix">Kholat Syakhl</span>, or &#8220;Dead Mountain&#8221; — but were later found spread out around the area in various stages of disrobing and destruction. The carnage seemed beyond what an avalanche would produce, and anyway there seemed to be no evidence or likelihood of one in the first place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For more than 60 years this has been a source of speculation and conspiracy, especially since there was the appearance of a cover-up by the Soviet government at the time. Even Russia revisiting the event in 2019 didn&#8217;t seem to produce a convincing explanation.</p>
<p>Enter Alexander Puzrin and Johan Gaume, from Switzerland&#8217;s ETH <span class="clearfix">Zürich</span> and EPFL, respectively, two highly prestigious and advanced technical institutes. Curious about the incident for their own reasons, they began looking into how to work out once and for all what happened. An interesting personal detail:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="clearfix">The scientific investigation came with an added benefit from Puzrin’s wife, who is Russian. “When I told her that I was working on the Dyatlov mystery, for the first time she looked at me with real respect,” he says.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>One hardly knows what to say!</p>
<p>At all events the researchers put together a new hypothesis based on a few ideas.</p>
<p>First, the slope was not as shallow as it appeared — it was near the minimum for an avalanche to occur, and the snow was characterized as having a base layer conducive to slippage of snow on top. Freezing winds could have added mass and set off a slide under the cut-out in which the group put their tent.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ES2Cmbvw5o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Second, Gaume visited the creators of the movie &#8220;Frozen,&#8221; which featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ES2Cmbvw5o">highly realistic snow simulation</a>. He met with Disney&#8217;s snow simulation specialist and got permission to use and modify the code — but in this case, to see what an avalanche striking sleeping students would do to them. Their simulations showed that it wouldn&#8217;t take much — a block of icy snow the size of a large car — to cause the devastation witnessed by the rescue party.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106078" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106078" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png" alt="Diagram showing simulation of snow as it might impact a person sleeping in a tent at Dyatlov." width="1024" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png 1827w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gaume, Puzrin / Nature</p></div></p>
<p>Third, they used research performed by GM that broke the ribs of a hundred cadavers — for the purposes of tuning seatbelts. They proposed that because the Russian students would have been sleeping on their skis, it was fairly similar to how certain cadavers with rigid supports reacted to impacts. Thus the horrific injuries instead of the usual asphyxiation produced by being submerged in a drift that usually happens to victims of avalanches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all still speculation on top of speculation, but the important part is that by combining these various, reasonably objective measures, Puzrin and Gaume show that it&#8217;s possible that an avalanche was responsible for the Dyatlov Pass incident, however rare the combination of circumstances must have been.</p>
<p>They freely admit that many may not accept this explanation — &#8220;It&#8217;s too normal,&#8221; said Gaume — and will continue to pursue the conspiracies and fantasy scenarios the incident has spawned for half a century. But for others it may offer some solace: a reason to believe that these poor nine souls were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where can new founders and budding entrepreneurs turn for expert advice to navigate the formative phases of building a startup? Head to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=DualEventPost">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> — a two-day virtual bootcamp that gives early founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to the leading experts across a range of essential entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>We’re talking dozens of workshops addressing operations, fundraising, pitch deck pointers, term sheet tips, product-market fit, brand building, growth marketing, recruiting, taming your tech stack and a lot more.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of ground to cover, amirite? That’s exactly why we’re hosting two Early Stage events this year. Each one offers different content, a separate slate of speakers and unique perspectives. Both feature highly interactive Q&amp;As with the experts. Get answers to all your burning questions!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In a hurry? Scroll down to the bottom (or click <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">here</a>) to get the 411 on pass types, early-bird pricing and deadlines.</p>
<p>The first TC-ES, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets?promo=DualEventPost">April 1 &amp; 2</a>, covers topics ranging from fundraising and operations to product lifecycle and recruiting — for starters. The second, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8 &amp; 9</a>, spans marketplace positioning, growth marketing, content development and even more on fundraising.</p>
<p>Sure, you can go to a single Early Stage event, but savvy startuppers (that’s you, right?) will sign on for a double dose of knowledge and attend both. That’s not just marketing talk — the benefits are real.</p>
<p>Buy a dual-event pass (for a tidy discount, by the way), and you’ll not only learn more, but you’ll also have more time to absorb and implement critical advice that can lead to your success. Seriously, which topics and tips can you afford to miss? Don’t let the FOMO haunt you.</p>
<p>You’ll also have plenty of opportunity to connect and network with other early founders, later-stage founders and other smart members of the startup — oh, what’s the word? — <em>community</em>. Build your contacts, find indispensable support and mentorship. Remember, we all go further together.</p>
<p>We introduced TC Early Stage last year to rave reviews — like this one from Chloe Leaaetoa, founder of Socicraft:</p>
<blockquote><p>You learn from industry leaders and seasoned founders — people who’ve already been there and done that. They were genuine and honest about industry expectations. Plus, they shared first-hand accounts, which made them more relatable.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this one from Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recommend going to Early Stage. The virtual aspect helps in terms of scheduling, it offers community-building through networking, and it gives early stage founders a framework for navigating the startup ecosystem. This is the stage where founders need more support, especially if they haven’t done this before.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go all-in and attend TC Early Stage 2021 in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April</a> and again in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July</a>. Increase your knowledge, sharpen your skills, avoid pitfalls and expand your network. Those are mighty big benefits, and you deserve every one of them.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a 20-year CIO and advisor to multiple startups, I sat on many customer advisory boards (CABs) and saw how they were formed. Some companies have highly functioning CABs, others merely serve as feedback loops. Any startup striving to connect directly with their customers would benefit from establishing one.</p>
<p>Here are some considerations to make certain your customer advisory board is a success.</p>
<h2>Why CABs matter</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, a customer advisory board is a group of customers who come together to share their experiences, insights and advice with an organization. First and foremost, the CAB functions to recognize and include the voice of the customer, an essential part of your company’s journey since customers interact closer than anyone with your product or service.</p>
<p>It’s best to designate early adopters to be on the board — those who took a chance on you and have been on the frontlines as your company evolved — as well as some newer customers.</p>
<p>While establishing this group signals appreciation and respect for your customers, it also provides an opportunity for you to formalize and structure the feedback you are requesting from them. You can seek validation for product ideas or guidance on roadmap development, test out marketing messaging and even tap into market intelligence.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of a CAB, however, is the creation of champions for your brand. These loyal partners will ultimately offer testimonials, references and referrals. Key to this partnership is a shared sense of playing a small part in building the future of your company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The greatest benefit of a CAB is the creation of champions for your brand.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Assembling your CAB superteam</h2>
<p>The best route to assembling your CAB is to start with a very small group and expand slowly. There’s quite a bit of nuance in the selection of who to include. Do you go after the executive who sponsored you, the one who saw a vision and thought your solution would fit?</p>
<p>Perhaps. But that individual may not be using your product every day, be involved deeply in its operational aspects and/or have their finger on the pulse of the end-user’s experience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of 1999, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins invested $25 million into an early-stage company developing a new search engine called Google, paving the way for a revolution in how knowledge online was organized and shared.</p>
<p>Now, Sequoia Capital is placing another bet on a different kind of search engine, one for physical objects in three dimensions, just as the introduction of three-dimensional sensing technologies on consumer phones are poised to create a revolution in spatial computing.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s the bet that Sequoia Capital&#8217;s Shaun Maguire is making on the Columbus, Ohio-based startup* <a href="https://physna.com/">Physna</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maguire and Sequoia are leading a $20 million bet into the company alongside Drive Capital, the Columbus, Ohio-based venture firm founded by two former Sequoia partners, Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="011IfW9zpN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/embed/#?secret=011IfW9zpN" data-secret="011IfW9zpN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been this open problem in mathematics, which is how you do three-dimensional search. How do you define a metric that gives you other similar three-dimensional objects. This has a long history in mathematics,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;When I first met [Physna founder] Paul Powers, he had already come up with a wildly novel distance metric to compare different three-dimensional objects. If you have one distance metric, you can find other objects that are a distance away. His thinking underlying that is so unbelievably creative. If I were to put it in the language of modern mathematics&#8230; it just involves a lot of really advanced ideas that actually also works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powers&#8217; idea &#8212; and Physna&#8217;s technology &#8212; was a long time coming.</p>
<p>A lawyer by training and an entrepreneur at heart, Powers came to the problem of three-dimensional search through his old day job as an intellectual property lawyer.</p>
<p>Powers chose IP law because he thought it was the most interesting way to operate at the intersection of technology and law &#8212; and would provide good grounding for whatever company the serial entrepreneur would eventually launch next. While practicing, Powers hit upon a big problem, while some intellectual property theft around software and services was easy to catch, it was harder to identify when actual products or parts were being stolen as trade secrets. &#8220;We were always able to find 2D intellectual property theft,&#8221; Powers said, but catching IP theft in three dimensions was elusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>From its launch in 2015 through 2019, Powers worked with co-founder and chief technology officer Glenn Warner Jr. on developing the product, which was initially intended to protect product designs from theft. Tragically, just as the company was getting ready to unveil its transformation into the three-dimensional search engine it had become, Warner died.</p>
<p>Powers soldiered on, rebuilding the company and its executive team with the help of Dennis DeMeyere, who joined the company in 2020 after a stint in Google&#8217;s office of the chief technology officer and technical director for Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I moved, I jumped on a plane with two checked bags and moved into a hotel, until I could rent a fully furnished home,&#8221; DeMeyere <a href="https://www.protocol.com/physna-3d-modeling-search-like-google">told Protocol last year.</a></p>
<p>Other heavy hitters were also drawn to the Cincinnati-based company thanks in no small part to Olsen and Kvamme&#8217;s Silicon Valley connections. They include GitHub&#8217;s chief technology officer, Jason Warner, who has a seat on the company&#8217;s board of directors alongside Drive Capital&#8217;s co-founder Kvamme, who serves as the chairman.</p>
<p>In Physna, Kvamme, Maguire and Warner see a combination of GitHub and Google &#8212; especially after the launch last year of the company&#8217;s consumer-facing site, <a href="https://thangs.com/">Thangs</a>.</p>
<p>That site allows users to search for three-dimensional objects by a description or by uploading a model or image. As Mike Murphy at Protocol noted, it&#8217;s a bit like Thingiverse, Yeggi or other sites used by 3D-printing hobbyists. What the site can also do is show users the collaborative history of each model and the model&#8217;s component parts &#8212; if it involves different objects.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9wp8LdhPGa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/meet-cocoa-press-the-philly-startup-making-a-3d-printer-for-chocolate/">Meet Cocoa Press, the Philly startup making a 3D printer for chocolate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet Cocoa Press, the Philly startup making a 3D printer for chocolate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/meet-cocoa-press-the-philly-startup-making-a-3d-printer-for-chocolate/embed/#?secret=9wp8LdhPGa" data-secret="9wp8LdhPGa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hence the GitHub and Google combination. And users can set up profiles to store their own models or collaborate and comment on public models.</p>
<p>What caught Maguire&#8217;s eye about the company was the way users were gravitating to the free site. &#8220;There were tens of thousands of people using it every day,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s a replica of the way many successful companies try a freemium or professional consumer hybrid approach to selling products. &#8220;They have a free version and people are using it all the time and loving it. That is a foundation that they can build from,&#8221; said Maguire.</p>
<p>And Maguire thinks that the spatial computing wave is coming sooner than anyone may realize. &#8220;The new iPhone has lidar on it&#8230; This is the first consumer device that comes shipped with a 3D scanner with lidar and I think three dimensional is about to explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Physna could be a technology hub where users can scan three-dimensional objects into their phones and have a representational model for reproduction either as a virtual object or as something that can be converted into a file for 3D printing.</p>
<p>Right now, hundreds of businesses have approached the company with different requests for how to apply its technology, according to Powers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One new feature will allow you to take a picture of something and not only show you what that is or where it goes. Even if that is into a part of the assembly. We shatter a vase and with the vase shards we can show you how the pieces fit back together,&#8221; Powers said.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Typical contracts for the company&#8217;s software range from $25,000 to $50,000 for enterprise customers, but the software that powers Physna&#8217;s product is more than just a single application, according to Powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just a product. We&#8217;re a fundamental technology,&#8221; said Powers. &#8220;There is a gap between the physical and the digital.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Sequoia and Drive Capital, Physna&#8217;s software is the technology to bridge that gap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Supreme Court&#8221; is now accepting comments on one of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">earliest and likely most consequential cases</a>. The Facebook Oversight Board announced Friday that it would <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">begin accepting public feedback</a> on Facebook&#8217;s suspension of former President Trump.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">announced Trump&#8217;s suspension on January 7</a>, after the then-president of the United States incited his followers to riot at the nation&#8217;s Capitol, an event that resulted in a number of deaths and imperiled the peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">post calling for feedback</a>, the Oversight Board describes the two posts that led to Trump&#8217;s suspension. One is a version of the video the president shared the day of the Capitol riot in which he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">sympathizes with rioters and validates their claim that the &#8220;election was stolen from us.&#8221;</a> In the second post, Trump reiterates those views, falsely bemoaning a &#8220;sacred landslide election victory&#8221; that was &#8220;unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The board says the point of the public comment process is to incorporate &#8220;diverse perspectives&#8221; from third parties who wish to share research that might inform their decisions, though it seems a lot more likely the board will wind up with a tidal wave of subjective and probably not particularly useful political takes. Nonetheless, the comment process will be open for 10 days and comments will be collected in an appendix for each case. The board will issue a decision on Trump&#8217;s Facebook fate within 90 days of January 21, though the verdict could come sooner.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board specifically invites public comments that consider:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether Facebook’s decision to suspend President Trump’s accounts for an indefinite period complied with the company’s responsibilities to respect freedom of expression and human rights, if alternative measures should have been taken, and what measures should be taken for these accounts going forward.</p>
<p>How Facebook should assess off-Facebook context in enforcing its Community Standards, particularly where Facebook seeks to determine whether content may incite violence.</p>
<p>How Facebook should treat the expression of political candidates, office holders, and former office holders, considering their varying positions of power, the importance of political opposition, and the public&#8217;s right to information.</p>
<p>The accessibility of Facebook’s rules for account-level enforcement (e.g. disabling accounts or account functions) and appeals against that enforcement.</p>
<p>Considerations for the consistent global enforcement of Facebook’s content policies against political leaders, whether at the content-level (e.g. content removal) or account-level (e.g. disabling account functions), including the relevance of Facebook’s “newsworthiness” exemption and Facebook’s human rights responsibilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Oversight Board&#8217;s post <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">gets very granular on the Trump suspension</a>, critiquing Facebook for lack of specificity when the company didn&#8217;t state exactly which part of its community standards were violated. Between this and the five recent cases, the board appears to view its role as a technical one, in which it examines each case against Facebook&#8217;s existing ruleset and then makes recommendations for future policy rather than working backward from its own broader recommendations.</p>
<p>The Facebook Oversight Board<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/"> announced its first cluster of decisions this week</a>, overturning the company&#8217;s own choice to remove potentially objectionable content in four of five cases. None of those cases pertained to content relevant to Trump&#8217;s account suspension, but they prove that the Oversight Board isn&#8217;t afraid to go against the company&#8217;s own thinking — at least when it comes to what gets taken down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A gig economy-powered consumer edtech platform is heading to the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Edtech startup <a href="https://www.nerdy.com/">Nerdy</a>, which owns the popular tutoring business <a href="https://www.varsitytutors.com/">Varsity Tutors,</a> is seeking to become a public company through a special purpose acquisition vehicle, otherwise known as a SPAC.</p>
<p>Nerdy will merge with TPG Pace Tech Opportunities (NYSE: PACE), a publicly traded SPAC since 2015. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal will value Nerdy at $1.7 billion. Through the transaction, the business plans to raise up to $750 million in cash, including $150 million in PIPE financing aggregated by Franklin Templeton, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Koch Industries and Learn Capital.</p>
<p>Nerdy’s flagship business, Varsity Tutors, is a two-sided marketplace that matches tutors to students in large, small or 1:1 group environments. The learning platform covers more than 3,000 subjects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/">Like other edtech companies</a>, Varsity Tutors uses artificial intelligence and data analytics to better match experts to learners. Additionally, in August, Varsity Tutors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/"> launched a homeschooling offering</a> meant to replace traditional school. It onboarded 120 full-time educators, who came from public schools and charter schools, with competitive salaries.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uApYKu6E9C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=uApYKu6E9C" data-secret="uApYKu6E9C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Financial performance</strong></h2>
<p>TechCrunch reviewed the Nerdy-SPAC investor presentation, which can be read <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819404/000119312521021623/d104457dex992.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nerdy is among consumer edtech businesses that saw rapid growth and opportunity due to the demands of remote learning brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. In the second half of 2020, Nerdy’s annualized revenue surpassed $120 million. In the last quarter of 2020, the company saw its online revenue grow 87%, online paid active learners grow 59% and paid online sessions grow 169%, compared to the same time period last year, the business reports.</p>
<p>Drilling into its realized results instead of its more-favorable annualized performance from its third and fourth quarters of 2020, Nerdy saw estimated revenues of $106 million in the year, up just 16% from its 2019 result.</p>
<p>That growth rate is slower than what it managed in 2019, some 26% growth, and is around half of what it anticipates for 2021, namely 31% growth. But Nerdy has even stronger projections for 2022, a year in which it expects to drive revenues of $198 million, up 43% from its 2021 expectation of $138 million.</p>
<p>Whether the company can hit those goals remains to be seen; SPAC-led debuts allow for the company being taken public in the transaction to forecast more than companies that follow traditional IPO paths are allowed.</p>
<p>The company’s growth also failed to stem its losses. Nerdy is not yet profitable. Its 2020 estimates list an anticipated net loss of $23 million, which is more than it lost in 2019 but less than its 2018 deficit. Based on last year’s growth, Nerdy estimates that its net loss will slim to $8 million in 2021, and will achieve profitability by 2023.</p>
<p>How did Nerdy fail to reduce its losses last year as its revenues expanded? The company’s costs showed modest gains and losses, apart from its sales and marketing line item. That particular realm of expense rose from $38 million in 2019 to an estimated $44 million in 2020.</p>
<p>In contrast, while Nerdy’s net losses were largely static in 2020, its estimated net margin did improve from -24% in 2019 to an estimated -22% in 2020. It has a ways to go to reach the black, though its financials do indicate that the company thinks that net income is only a few years away.</p>
<p>To reach profitability, Nerdy anticipates it will require 2023 revenues of $267 million, growth from 2022 of 35% and gross margins five points stronger than its 67% result it estimated it reached last year.</p>
<p>A closer look at Nerdy’s business brings up a common question amid the SPAC boom: Is the reverse-merger being used to bring companies with lackluster near-term growth stories to the public market that otherwise couldn’t have? So far, a number of edtech startups <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-01-27-public-edtech-companies-have-been-rare-these-spacs-will-change-that">have taken the SPAC route</a>, including Skillsoft, Meten International and now Nerdy.</p>

<p>After edtech had a strong 2020, sector investors say to expect more exits as startups cross the $100 million ARR mark. Deborah Quazzo, managing partner of GSV, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/vistas-3-5b-purchase-of-pluralsight-signals-a-maturing-edtech-market/">told TechCrunch in December</a> that “what’s happening in edtech is that capital markets are liquidating.” The ability to move fluidly between privately held and publicly held companies is a characteristic of tech sectors with deep capital markets, which is different from edtech’s “old days, where the options to exit were very narrow.”</p>

<p>One of the most exciting, challenging and potentially lucrative areas of the IoT is the automotive sector. The car is a major component of most people’s daily lives, and a &#8220;smart&#8221; car could do a lot to save people time and money.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The promises and problems of connected cars</h2>
<p>Imagine if your car was able to call your mechanic when the engine was showing signs of trouble. Imagine if the mechanic could read a data report from your engine and order the required parts ahead of time. Imagine if the data on those parts could be aggregated to warn of the need for any mass recalls? What if your car could communicate with other cars around it in a traffic jam, and the cars could all work together to space out and ease congestion?</p>
<p>What if your car could pay automatically at parking garages and drive-throughs? Anyone that owns a car is familiar with all these pain points, and the prospect of a new system that erases these spots of friction would be a welcome development.</p>
<p>But how can we ensure that all of this new data from our smart cars will be handled in a secure and private way? It seems likely, as car manufacturers work quickly to bring their products online, that tech giants will be the first partners to help implement the Internet of Cars. This might be cause for concern amongst consumers who are growing tired of their data being sold or hacked. The big tech companies aren’t inherently evil, but their basic business models are structured in such a way that consumer privacy and security are not the main priorities.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to imagine how the Internet of Cars could move in a much darker direction: Advertisements with real-time location data updating constantly on your windshield, personal data such as your driving habits stored on central servers, and a myriad of new vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. How do we bring cars online so that friction in our lives is smoothed down without introducing a unique set of new problems?</p>
<h2>Data security must be the foundation of the IoC</h2>
<p>Of course Big Tech companies will be eager to offer connectivity for drivers, but it’s most likely going to come at the price of giving personal data over to Big Tech servers. This brings with it, as always, two major problems. The first is that centralized data represents a honeypot for hackers. No matter the strength of the security system, hackers realize that once they break through, they have access to the whole pot. The second problem is that the value of all that data is simply too lucrative for the owner to ignore. The data will always be sold, regardless of all the lip service promising to make it anonymous.</p>
<p>The IoT represents a new layer of IT integration in our lives; it will be at least as much of a game-changer as the internet was originally. Even with the advancement of the mobile internet brought about by smartphones, internet implementations have, until now, basically been carried out through clunky interfaces like screens, keyboards and mouses. The IoT is going to bring a new level of sophistication to how and where we interface online, but this also means a new level of intrusion into our physical reality. In the case of cars, we can be rightly wary that this new development might be problematic, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>Distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents a path forward for the Internet of Cars, because it builds data security and privacy into the foundations of any connected devices. Any model of DLT includes some basic concepts such that data is carried on a decentralized network of computers and servers. It also means that data is stored permanently, and that new entries of any data are subject to a mathematical verification. DLT is a fundamentally different way to handle massive amounts of data. DLTs have proven to be extremely resilient to attacks, and the data on these networks is nearly impossible to collect and sell.</p>
<h2>Picking the right tool for the job</h2>
<p>There are millions of internet-connected cars already on the road, albeit mostly with crude subscription services for music and weather apps. With further advances, connection will be much more encompassing, with the average connected car having up to 200 sensors installed, each recording a point of data, minute by minute. The numbers quickly become staggering, and in emergency situations, the need for data agility is apparent. Picture driving on a highway in medium traffic.</p>
<p>If someone’s tire blows out half a mile ahead, this information could be quickly conveyed to surrounding cars, warning of the potential for emergency braking. Any DLT solution would have to include a very nimble verification process for all these new packets of information to be brought into and carried by the network.</p>
<p>Additionally, because of the computational complexity involved, almost all DLTs today charge a fee for each new transaction brought into the network. In fact, the fee is an integral part of the structure of many of these computational models. This is obviously not going to be workable in a system like urban traffic that would be generating billions of “transactions” every day. The truth is that decentralized data networks were never designed to handle these kinds of massive use-case scenarios. Blockchain, for example, is very elegant at <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/censorship-resistance">censorship-resistance</a> in a network, and this has proven valuable in certain financial use cases.</p>
<p>But a DLT that expects a little money every time a car’s air conditioning reports its output is simply unusable for that application. Any DLT that’s going to give us a high level of security and real-time connectivity will also have to be feeless.</p>
<p>Security, speed and ease of adaptability through a no-fee structure are the three critical points for any network backing up the Internet of Cars. DLTs are clearly the most secure option, but they must also provide scalability and a feeless structure.</p>
<p>The example of being able to pay automatically for a parking garage visit might seem like a trite convenience. In actuality, if we can implement these types of small transactions properly from the beginning, then the hurdles we will jump in solving the complexity and volume of the car traffic data environment will go a long way to creating a safe, consumer-friendly Internet of Things in general.</p>
<p>When thinking about a completely connected physical environment, the alternatives to scalable, fee-less DLT are frankly scary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket fuel technology startup Firehawk Aerospace has added $1.2 million to its existing seed financing, bringing the full amount invested in the round to $2.5 million. The new tranche comes from Harlow Capital Management, a Dallas-based firm run by Colby Harlow, who will join Firehawk&#8217;s board of directors as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Firewhawk, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/firehawk-aerospace-aims-to-revolutionize-rocketry-with-safe-cost-effective-hybrid-engines/">finalist in our first-ever all-virtual Startup Battlefield at TC Disrupt last September,</a> has developed a new kind of hybrid rocket fuel that greatly enhances rocket launch safety, cost and transportation using additive manufacturing (basically, the grown-up version of 3D printing). Hybrid rocket fuel (which combines aspects of both liquid and solid propellants used previously) isn&#8217;t new, but past technology has been unable to compete on cost and efficacy relative to existing nonhybrid alternatives.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Chief Scientist Ron Jones was able to get around these limitations with two new approaches: Using a fuel with a hard polymer structure and producing it using additive manufacturing instead of casting via molds with a liquid that hardens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Firehawk now intends to use its seed funding to test its technology in operational conditions and at the kind of scale required for commercialization, and to build out its partnerships and client list. The startup also intends to grow its R&amp;D and manufacturing operations in both Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each year <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> processes millions of SaaS logons via its authentication system. It kindly aggregates that data to find the most popular apps and publishes <a href="https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2021">an annual report</a>. This year it found that the most popular tool by far was Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while app usage popularity varied by region, Office 365 was number one with a bullet across the board, whether globally or when the report broke it down by geographic area. That wasn&#8217;t true of any other product in this report, so Office 365 has extensive usage across the world (at least among companies that use Okta).</p>
<p>But as with everything cloud, it&#8217;s not a simple matter to say that because lots of people signed onto Office 365, Microsoft is the clear winner in a broader sense. In reality, the cloud is a complex marketplace, and just because people use one tool doesn&#8217;t preclude them from using tools that compete directly with it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a case in point, consider that the report found that 36% of Microsoft 365 customers were also using Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite), which offers a similar set of office productivity tools. Further, Okta found that 42% of Office 365 customers were using Zoom and 32% were using Slack.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How should SaaS companies deliver and price professional services?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/how-should-saas-companies-deliver-and-price-professional-services/embed/#?secret=ZXzyDOLKpe" data-secret="ZXzyDOLKpe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is pretty remarkable when you consider that Office 365 bundles Teams with similar functionality for free. What&#8217;s more, so does Google with Google Hangouts, so people use the tool they want when they want, and sometimes it seems they use competing versions of the same tool. The report also found that of those Office 365 users, 44% are using Salesforce, 41% AWS, 15% Smartsheet and 14% Tableau (which is owned by Salesforce). Microsoft has products in all those categories.</p>
<p>Microsoft is clearly a big company with a lot of products, but the report blows a hole in the idea that because people like Office 365, they are going to be big fans of other Microsoft products, or that they can count on any kind of brand loyalty across the range of products or even exclusivity within the same product category.</p>
<p>All of this, and much of the other data in this report makes tremendously interesting reading as far as it goes. It&#8217;s not a definitive window on the state of SaaS. It&#8217;s a definitive reading on the state of Okta customers&#8217; use of SaaS, on the Okta Integration Network (OIN), a point the company readily acknowledges in the report&#8217;s methodology section.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you read this report, keep in mind that this data is representative of Okta’s customers, the applications and integrations we connect to through the OIN, and the ways in which users access these tools through our service,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p>But it is a way to look at the state of SaaS taking advantage of the 9400 Okta customers using the network and the 6,500 integrations to the world&#8217;s most popular SaaS tools. That gives the company a unique view into the world of SaaS. What you can conclude is that the cloud is complicated, and it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game by any means. In fact, being a winner in one area is not a guarantee of winning across the board.</p>
