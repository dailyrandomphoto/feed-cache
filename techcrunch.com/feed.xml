					<description><![CDATA[Duolingo, a consumer edtech company, is now more valuable per revenue-dollar than the median public enterprise SaaS business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the Chinese technology market digests a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">new regulatory landscape</a> impacting the country&#8217;s edtech market in a sharply negative manner, U.S. education technology companies have something to cheer about: Duolingo&#8217;s IPO priced very well.</p>
<p>The language-learning unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">initially targeted an $85 to $95 per-share IPO price range</a>. That interval was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">raised to $95 to $100 per share</a>. And then, last night, Duolingo <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/duolingo-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301342683.html">priced at $102 per share</a>, just over its raised range.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of IPO pricing run that we tend to see from hot enterprise software companies (SaaS) that investors have favored heavily in recent quarters. But the stock market has also provided nigh-indulgent valuations to consumer-facing tech companies with strong brands, like Airbnb. So, the Duolingo IPO&#8217;s pricing strength should not be an utter surprise.</p>
<p>But it is a welcome result for U.S. edtech, regardless. When the company set its first IPO price range, TechCrunch noted that it was on track to earn a new, higher valuation. This led us to the following set of conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Duolingo poses a strong debut, consumer edtech startups will be able to add a golden data point to their pitch decks. A strong Duolingo listing could also signal that mission-driven startups can have impressive turns.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now Duolingo has managed to price <em>above</em> its <em>raised</em> range. Yeehaw, as they say.</p>
<p>In more prosaic terms, Duolingo has set a higher multiple for edtech revenue than we expected it to, implying that the exit value of edtech top line could be greater than private-market investors anticipated. After all, Duolingo was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">valued at around $2.4 billion last November</a>. At its IPO price, the company&#8217;s non-diluted valuation is now $3.66 billion, not counting 765,916 shares that its underwriters may purchase at the $102-per-share price if they so choose.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, payouts, and 'unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://quotapath.com">QuotaPath</a>, which has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams, has raised $21.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing backers ATX Ventures, Integr8d Capital, Stage 2 Capital and HubSpot Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to $26.3 million since its 2018 inception.</p>
<p>The funding comes amid a year of growth for the startup, which has dual headquarters in Austin and Philadelphia. Specifically, QuotaPath has seen 600% revenue growth since January 2021. It has over 5,000 users on the platform, 40% of which are paid. Customers include Guru, Contractbook, Mailgun, Cloud Academy, SaaSOptics and OSG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AJ Bruno, Cole Evetts and Eric Heydenberk founded QuotaPath with the mission of helping “companies build and scale high-performing, motivated growth teams.” The startup said it gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, incorrect payouts, and “unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.”</p>
<p>Through real-time CRM integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot and Close.com, sales reps are able to glean more insight into earnings and quota attainment, the company said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4R84dtUNiB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/6-vcs-talk-the-future-of-austins-exploding-startup-ecosystem/">6 VCs talk the future of Austin&#8217;s exploding startup ecosystem</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 VCs talk the future of Austin&#8217;s exploding startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/6-vcs-talk-the-future-of-austins-exploding-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=4R84dtUNiB" data-secret="4R84dtUNiB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bruno is no stranger to startups, having co-founded Austin-based PR analytics company TrendKite, which sold to rival Cision in 2019 for $225 million. It was there that Bruno ran the sales and management teams, and about “30 folks into it,” was having some issues with compensation and commission. It took a month and getting several people involved to get the situation sorted. After trying to onboard a sales and commission tool for eight months and “failing miserably,” Bruno saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>“The reps needed to understand what their comp plans were and they didn&#8217;t have real-time visibility into the earnings and forecasting of their compensation,” he said. So he and Evetts (who was director of revenue and sales operations at TrendKite) ultimately set about creating a workflow to solve the problem. Heydenberk joined as a technical co-founder and the company went on to raise about $5 million in pre-seed and seed funding.</p>
<p>“What we ultimately said was going to be our north star is that we want the sales team and the sales reps to easily understand the compensation plans, and to do that, we had to build an onboarding setup where it didn&#8217;t look like a spreadsheet that was in Excel because most sales reps don&#8217;t understand Excel,” Bruno recalled. The team then spent a year working with end users and sales reps to build the back-end infrastructure of the platform so that sales teams could “interpret what was actually happening and all the mechanisms behind it.”</p>
<p>Requirements were that it was fast to onboard (less than one week) and easily adjustable so that customers could make changes in real-time themselves and not have to wait on a company to make them.</p>
<p>“With QuotaPath, a sales team can forecast more earnings and create more goals around what they want to do,” Bruno said, “and connect those goals to the bottom line of the company.”</p>

<p>The startup launched its paid platform in June 2020 and works with companies with as few as three reps to as many as a few hundred that range from SaaS to commerce shops to low-tech businesses such as wedding venues and funeral homes.</p>
<p>“With 10.5 million salespeople in the U.S., this is a very large market,” Bruno said. Indeed, there are a number of other startups addressing the space. Earlier this year,<a href="http://captivateiq.com/"> CaptivateIQ</a>, which has developed a no-code platform to help companies design customized sales commission plans, announced it had raised $46 million in a Series B round led by Accel.</p>

<p>QuotaPath currently has 28 employees and plans to use its new capital to double its headcount by year’s end. It also plans to work on scaling partnerships and expanding product offerings to finance and HR functions.</p>
<p>Rachel Geller, managing director at Insight Partners, is taking a seat on the company’s board as part of the financing. She said that a priority of Insight Onsite, the firm’s ScaleUp engine, is to help its portfolio “build high-performing and scalable sales and marketing functions.”</p>
<p>“Our sales experts are in the trenches understanding the challenges sales teams face, and tracking sales commissions is top of mind,” she said. “Organizations need a formula-free solution to their current pain of spreadsheets and legacy solutions, and QuotaPath presents a clear alternative.”</p>
<p>In particular, Geller said Insight was impressed by QuotaPath’s “ease of use and fast time to deploy” compared to other solutions.</p>
<p>“QuotaPath customers can be up and running in days,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter this morning will launch a pilot in the U.S. aimed at testing the potential for e-commerce on its platform. The company is introducing a new &#8220;Shop Module&#8221; that offers brands, businesses and other retailers the ability to showcase their products to Twitter users directly on their profile. Users will then be able to scroll through a carousel of product images, and tap through on a product they&#8217;re interested in purchasing. This opens up the business&#8217;s website inside the Twitter app itself, where the customer can learn more about the product in question and make a purchase.</p>
<p>The Shop Module itself will appear in a new, dedicated space at the top of a supported Twitter profile, which can be seen by U.S. users in English on iOS devices.</p>
<p>The company tells us that only businesses with a Professional Profile will be able to use the feature at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Professional Profiles, which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBusiness/status/1384968745156755458">began testing in April</a>, give businesses, non-profits, publishers and creators the ability to display specific information about their business directly on their profile, including things like their address, phone number, operating hours, and more. Essentially, it&#8217;s the Twitter equivalent to something like a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/pages/set-up">Facebook Page</a> for a business.</p>
<p>At launch, the Shop Module will be made available to only a small group of pilot testers. In addition to gaming retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/GameStop&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg0cqZDRjihyEmld5SL90gWhxMyQ">@GameStop</a> and travel brand <a href="https://twitter.com/ArdenCove" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/ArdenCove&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8ppJKhlLMylrdio9TEqhhboJCqg">@ArdenCove</a>, Twitter says there will only be approximately 10 other brands across the lifestyle, traditional retail, gaming, media and entertainment, tech and telco industries who will gain access to the new feature.</p>
<p>At present, Twitter isn&#8217;t offering a way for interested businesses to sign up for the pilot, as the company is only in the initial phases of testing this feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183081" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183081" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2183081" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Arden-Cove-GIF.gif?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183081" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>While Twitter users often discuss products on the app and even reach out to companies directly for help with purchases, it&#8217;s unclear whether or not users will come to view Twitter as a shopping platform.</p>
<p>With the pilot, Twitter says it wants to better understand what sort of products drive traffic to online retailers. For example, it wants to determine whether people are inspired by online conversations in the heat of the moment &#8212; like sports fans buying team apparel &#8212; or whether Twitter users could be encouraged to make purchases of a more lasting impact, like products for a new skincare routine. Having a diverse lineup of early pilot testers will help it to compare data across verticals to learn what works best.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will also work directly with businesses to better understand their needs through the creation of a new Merchant Advisory Board, which will consist of &#8220;best-in-class examples&#8221; of merchants on Twitter.</p>
<p>The company earlier this year had mentioned its plans to expand into e-commerce.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/twitter-analyst-day/default.aspx">Twitter&#8217;s Analyst Da</a>y presentation in February, where it first announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">its Super Follow platform</a> for creators, the company also briefly mentioned it planned to invest in e-commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re…starting to explore ways to better support commerce on Twitter,” Twitter Revenue Lead, Bruce Falck, had said during the event. “We know people come to Twitter to interact with brands and discuss their favorite products. In fact, you may have even noticed some businesses already developing creative ways to enable sales on our platform,” he continued.</p>
<p>“This demand gives us confidence in the power of combining real-time conversation with an engaged and intentional audience. Imagine easily discovering, and quickly purchasing, a new skincare product or trendy sneaker from a brand you follow with only a few clicks,” Falck added.</p>
<p>Since then, Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">tested a new e-commerce feature for tweets</a>, which allowed businesses to link out to online product pages &#8212; like those on a Shopify store, for instance.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IWc2MYmv3v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">Twitter tests new e-commerce features for tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter tests new e-commerce features for tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/embed/#?secret=IWc2MYmv3v" data-secret="IWc2MYmv3v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal also touted the potential to shop on Twitter when speaking to investors at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications conference in May, noting that people &#8220;do a lot of research on Twitter before they buy something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s entry into online shopping comes at a time when social platforms are ramping up their investments in e-commerce. Facebook has made major moves into e-commerce with shopping features across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook, Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">WhatsApp</a>, including with online storefronts, integrated <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-checkout">checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">product drops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/instagram-expands-shopping-on-igtv-plans-test-of-shopping-on-reels/">video shopping</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Shopify has also partnered with a number of tech platforms, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/shopify-expands-its-one-click-checkout-shop-pay-to-any-merchant-on-facebook-or-google/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Google</a>, to make it easier for consumers to connect with products sold by its merchants.</p>
<p>Twitter had before attempted to run a commerce operation and failed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/bye-buy-on-twitter/">In 2017, the company begin to wind down its &#8220;Buy&#8221; button product</a>, which had allowed Twitter users click to make purchases, and the retailer partnerships associated with that effort due to lack of traction. Clearly, the company believes the time is now right to try again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you parked your car in one of the thousands of parking spots across Calgary, there&#8217;s a good chance you paid the Calgary Parking Authority for the privilege. But soon you might be hearing from the authority after a recent security lapse exposed the personal information of vehicle owners.</p>
<p>The parking authority oversees about 14% of the paid parking spots in the Calgary region, and lets drivers pay to park their cars by a parking kiosk, online, or through the phone app by entering their vehicle&#8217;s license plate and their payment details.</p>
<p>But a logging server used to monitor the authority&#8217;s parking system for bugs and errors was left on the internet without a password. The server contained computer-readable technical logs, but also real-world events like payments and parking tickets that contained a driver&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>A review of the logs by TechCrunch found contact information, like driver&#8217;s full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses, as well as details of parking tickets and parking offenses — which included license plates and vehicle descriptions — and in some cases the location data of where the alleged parking offense took place. The logs also contained some partial card payment numbers and expiry dates.</p>
<p>None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Because the server&#8217;s data was entangled with logs and other computer-readable data, it&#8217;s not known exactly how many people had their information exposed by the security lapse. (In 2019, the Calgary Parking Authority issued <a href="https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/for-small-business-success-listening-to-your-critics-is-just-as-important-as-listening-to-your-fans">more than 450,000 parking tickets</a>, up by 69% in five years.)</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha">Anurag Sen</a> found the exposed server and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. The server was secured on Tuesday, a day after TechCrunch contacted the authority.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the authority confirmed that the server was exposed since May 13, though data seen by TechCrunch shows records dating back to at least the start of the year. The authority also told TechCrunch that the exposure was due to human error and that it was investigating its logs to determine if anyone else had access to the server.</p>
<p>&#8220;We at the CPA take this very seriously,&#8221; said Moe Houssaini, the acting general manager for the Calgary Parking Authority, told TechCrunch in a statement. &#8220;Any public access has been disabled and we are actively investigating to determine what exact data was impacted and what unauthorized access may have occurred. We apologize to our customers and will be reaching out to all individuals who may have been impacted. Protecting the security of our systems and privacy of our customers is a top priority of the CPA. It was an isolated error, and the database has now been secured. We are reviewing our procedures to ensure that this does not happen again,&#8221; said Houssaini.</p>
<p>The Calgary Parking Authority recently made headlines after it canceled more than a thousand parking tickets for drivers who were attending a COVID-19 vaccination center in the city.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New York-based cashless parking startup ParkMobile <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/">reported a data breach</a> that saw personal account information and license plates on some 21 million customers taken by hackers. The company blamed the breach on <a href="https://support.parkmobile.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058639032-Security-Notification-March-2021">a vulnerability</a> in an unspecified piece of third-party software.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Elon Musk mused that Tesla's batteries may eventually be two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. 'And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk earlier this week made his most bullish statements yet on iron-based batteries, noting that Tesla is making a “long-term shift” toward older, cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells in its energy storage products and some entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>The Tesla CEO mused that the company&#8217;s batteries may eventually be roughly two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. “And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world,” he added.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s comments reflect a change that is already underway within the automotive sector, mainly in China. Battery chemistries outside of China have been predominantly nickel-based &#8212; specifically nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA). These newer chemistries have become attractive to automakers due to their higher energy density, letting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) improve the range of their batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If Musk&#8217;s bullishness is heralding a genuine shift across the EV industry, the question is whether battery makers outside of China will be able to keep up.</p>
<p>Musk is not the only automotive executive to signal a return to the LFP formula. Earlier this year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company would use LFP batteries in some commercial vehicles. Meanwhile, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess announced during the company’s inaugural battery day presentation that LFP would be used in some VW entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Musk&#8217;s comments about using LFP-based chemistries in Powerwall and Megapack are in line with other stationary energy storage companies pushing for iron-based formulas. “The stationary storage industry wants to move to LFP because it&#8217;s cheaper,” Sam Jaffe, who heads the battery research firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LFP battery cells are attractive for a few different reasons. For one, they’re not dependent on ultra-scarce and price-volatile raw materials like cobalt and nickel. (Cobalt, which is predominantly sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has undergone additional scrutiny due to inhumane mining conditions.) And while they are less energy-dense than nickel-based chemistries, LFP batteries are much cheaper. This is good news for those looking to spur the shift to electric vehicles because lowering the cost per vehicle will likely be key to greater EV adoption.</p>
<p>Musk clearly sees a major future for iron-based chemistries at Tesla, and his comments have helped thrust LFP back into the spotlight. But there&#8217;s one place where they&#8217;ve remained the star of the show: China.</p>
<h2>China’s monopoly on LFP</h2>
<p>“LFP is pretty much only produced in China,” Caspar Rawles, head of price and data assessments at the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explained in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>China’s dominance in LFP battery production in part relates to a series of key LFP patents, which are managed by a consortium of universities and research institutions. This consortium came to an agreement with Chinese battery makers a decade ago under which the manufacturers would not be charged a licensing fee providing that the LFP batteries were used only in Chinese markets.</p>
<p>Hence, China cornered the LFP market.</p>
<p>Battery makers in China may benefit most from a potential tectonic shift toward LFP &#8212; specifically BYD and CATL, the latter of which already manufactures LFP batteries for Tesla vehicles built and sold in China. (Volkswagen, meanwhile, has a substantial stake in Chinese LFP maker Gotion High-Tech.) These b<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">attery makers aren’t slowing down: In January, CATL and Shenzhen Dynanonic signed an agreement with a local Chinese province to build an LFP cathode plant at a cost of $280 million over three years.</span></p>
<p>The LFP patents are due to expire in 2022, industry analyst <a href="https://roskill.com/news/batteries-the-true-drivers-behind-lfp-demand-new-safety-standards-costs-ip-rights-esg-simplified-battery-pack-designs/">Roskill explains</a>, which could give battery manufacturers outside China time to start shifting some of their production toward iron-based formulas. However, all of the planned battery factories in Europe and North America, many of which are joint ventures with South Korean industry giants like LG Chem or SK Innovation, are still focused on nickel-based chemistries.</p>
<p>“For the U.S. to take advantage of LFP&#8217;s strengths, North American manufacturing will be necessary,” Jaffe explained. “Everyone building a gigafactory in the U.S. today is planning on making high nickel chemistries. There&#8217;s an enormous unmet need for locally manufactured LFP batteries.”</p>
<p>Rawles said he expects some LFP capacity in North America and Europe in the coming years, particularly after the patents expire. He pointed out that both CATL and SVOLT, another battery maker, have been making moves in Germany &#8212; but both of these companies are Chinese, which leaves open the question of whether other Asian or Western companies can compete in the LFP market. (Stellantis chose SVOLT as one of its battery suppliers from 2025 onwards.)</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Jaffe said he thinks “it&#8217;s inevitable that most stationary storage systems will eventually be LFP.”</p>
<p>However, not all is lost for domestic manufacturing in the United States. “The good news for building local LFP manufacturing is that the supply chain is simple: Outside of lithium, it&#8217;s iron and phosphoric acid, two cheap materials already made [in the U.S.] in large quantities,” Jaffe added.</p>
<p>In the end, it is not a question of one battery chemistry versus another. What’s more likely is what we’ve already started to see from automakers, including Tesla: Iron-based batteries will be used predominately in entry-level and cheaper vehicles, while nickel-based cells will be used for higher-end and performance cars. Many consumers will likely be content with a 200- to 250-mile-range vehicle that&#8217;s thousands of dollars cheaper than one with a range of 300 to 350 miles.</p>
<p>Automakers have also begun making moves to take control of the battery supply, whether through vertical manufacturing or joint ventures with established battery companies. That means that growing LFP capacity in North America and Europe is not only likely, but inevitable.</p>

		Wilkin Sanchez is the founder of the Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rihispanictech/">RIGHT</a>).	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I first came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, nobody wanted to hire me for a job in tech.</p>
<p>Rather than recognize the skills I possessed, employers could only see my still-developing English and my lack of a college degree. They failed to take into account my years of experience working with technology and electronics because the route I had taken was too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>It’s a situation all too common for the more than <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/reach-stars-report/">70 million workers in the U.S.</a> who are <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/">skilled through alternative routes (STAR)</a> — especially for the <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/hispanic-stars/">13.5 million Hispanic STAR</a> workers like me out there today. If the employers who are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-job-openings-united-states/">struggling to fill open tech roles</a> want to overcome the growing “skills gap,” then it’s a situation that must change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When I arrived in the U.S., I applied to countless IT jobs, from customer service to computer repair. Every company rejected me before they even gave me the chance to show what I could do. Had employers taken the time to talk to me, they would have learned I started fixing my neighbors’ phones and computers at the age of 12, and that I had already sailed through a series of computer classes on networking, basic coding, cybersecurity, scripting and computer repairs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even as I continued to learn English and mastered coding and cybersecurity concepts, companies failed to recognize what I could bring to the table. My background was too unfamiliar to make it past most employment filters that relied on degree requirements. I was often screened out of the hiring process before showcasing my talents, and I faced the biases of hiring managers who weren’t used to candidates like me. I could only get cleaning jobs or work at factories and fast food restaurants — places where I felt all my skills were going to waste.</p>
<p>I ended up getting lucky, and thanks to mentoring and hiring support through a follow-on to President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/technology/techhire">TechHire Initiative</a>, doors began to open. After years of struggling, I could finally get my foot in the door, meet hiring managers and showcase my skills. I am now working as a cybersecurity associate, but my career could have begun much earlier.</p>
<p>Sadly, this story is a familiar one for far too many STAR workers, especially Hispanic people. Many of them aren’t as lucky as I am.</p>
<p>The statistics are sobering. About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for. Recent research shows, for instance, that there are 114,000 Hispanic workers employed as food and hospitality service managers, who have the skills to transition to similarly skilled jobs as community and social services managers, where wages are nearly 50% higher.</p>
<p>Hispanic STAR workers <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/navigating-stars-report/#wpcf7-f2868-o1">are also less likely</a> to transition to higher-wage jobs than their white counterparts, and even when they are able to make such a transition, they are compensated less for their skills.</p>
<p>Employers must begin building more promising pathways that are accessible to all workers. The need for this shift has only grown over the last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Latino communities. Hispanic or Latino workers accounted for <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/03/05/496733/latinos-face-disproportionate-health-economic-impacts-covid-19/">nearly one-quarter</a> of the pandemic’s initial job losses. Even as the economy continues to slowly recover, the unemployment rate for those workers sits at 8.6%, compared with 5.7% for white workers. The fallout has been especially pronounced among Hispanic and Latina women. In December, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/08/covid-job-losses-women-december-us-unemployment-rate/">accounted for 45%</a> of all job losses.</p>
<p>All this is happening while employers say they are struggling to find workers to fill open positions, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/15/966376492/millions-are-out-of-a-job-yet-some-employers-wonder-why-cant-i-find-workers">millions remain unemployed</a> and job postings have <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/02/02/job-postings-through-jan-29/">begun to return</a> to pre-pandemic levels. The narrative around <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/09/the-labor-market-doesnt-have-a-skills-gap-it-has-an-opportunity-gap/">skills gaps</a> continue to be perpetuated by employers, and they <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-02-01-covid-19-has-widened-the-skills-gap-but-it-also-presents-an-opportunity-to-close-it">may have worsened</a> during the COVID-19 crisis. These gaps are <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/projecting-future-skill-shortages-through-2029/">expected to cost</a> the U.S. economy $1.2 trillion over the following decade, but most of these gaps aren’t actually real. They’re just the consequence of employers ignoring workers who learned their skills through alternative routes.</p>
<p>By rethinking hiring barriers like degree requirements, employers can more easily find job-ready talent and improve diversity at the same time. Such shifts can lead to even more systemic change down the road.</p>
<p>My success doesn’t end with me, as there is a multiplier effect to hiring STAR workers. Now that I have a strong foothold in the industry, I am able to help other members of my community. I formed an organization called Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (RIGHT) to provide training in basic computing, coding, cybersecurity and digital literacy — all in Spanish.</p>
<p>If America is going to build back better, employers need to seek out and hire more workers who are skilled through alternate routes. They must begin to look beyond the traditional signals of employability and expand their understanding of what makes a good employee. Those who fail to do so will continue to miss out on the more than 13 million talented Hispanic STAR workers like me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won't be the same from here on out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Watching the Chinese technology sector over the last week has been a fascinating exercise. The Chinese government took on entire industries like edtech while also coming down on individual companies (Tencent, Meituan) in a broad effort to change the country&#8217;s technology landscape.</p>
<p>The sum of the financial damage is easy to understand. The <a href="https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/History/HXC">NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index</a>, for example, which tracks U.S.-listed companies that do their business in China, fell from a 52-week high set earlier this year of 20,893.02 to 10,672.37 yesterday. You can also track the decline in value of various Chinese technology companies both on-shore and on foreign exchanges if you want to get an even fuller picture of the financial carnage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common among commentators and analysts to draw a direct line between the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/pulled-ant-group-ipo-costs-alibaba-nearly-60b-in-market-cap/">blocked Ant Group IPO last year</a>, the ensuing fall from grace of Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, and the latest news out of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s (CCP) regulatory bodies. That&#8217;s reasonable. Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won&#8217;t be the same from here on out.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve explored the moment a little, noting last week that edtech investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">could slow</a> in the country provided that the government went through with its plan to force tutoring companies to go nonprofit. The government then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">did so</a>, and more, also blocking tutoring companies from being formed, going public, raising external capital from foreign sources and more. It was comprehensive. Natasha Mascarenhas has a great read on the matter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, bad news for startups? After all, if edtech investment could slow in the face of regulatory changes, what about other technology-influenced areas of business?</p>
<p>The negative case is somewhat easy to make. The positive case is more interesting. Some market watchers are making the argument that by taking on some of China&#8217;s largest technology companies, more room could be cleared in the country for smaller companies to snag a piece of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jason Saltzman is a serial entrepreneur. He first cofounded SeamlessDocs and then went on to found The Alley, a coworking space based out of New York City. Following Alley&#8217;s joint venture partnership with Verizon, Saltzman left to build something new and became fascinated with the debt consolidation and relief space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how <a href="https://www.relief.app/">Relief</a>, cofounded by Saltzman, Bryan Okeke, and Ram Barrouet, was born. Today, the startup is announcing it has raised $2 million via a convertible note, led by Collaborative Fund, BFV, Necessary Venture, The Fund. Angels also participated in the round, including Justin Kan, Ben Kaplan, Elliot Tabule, and David Galanter.</p>
<p>Saltzman&#8217;s thesis came out of his observation of the space. Third-party debt collection agencies use lots of automation tools but those same services aren&#8217;t extended to the individuals seeking debt relief. Relief is an app that uses machine learning algorithms and collective bargaining to reduce debt balances. In essence, Relief does the math on behalf of users and negotiates directly with creditors to bring down the balance (in half of more, according to Saltzman), all for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not unlike Justworks, Relief uses the power of its entire user base to negotiate with creditors to bring down balances and lower interest rates. Once the negotiation is complete, Relief sets up a payment plan for users to pay off the rest of their debt.</p>
<p>Offering debt consolidation and loans for folks in financial peril is not new, but the ability to negotiate on behalf of the user is not a broadly available feature on most similar platforms.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a platform to help folks save money. Saltzman explained that Relief app is an alternative to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To start, Relief will generate revenue by the credit issuers who pay to have settlements handled, with Relief taking the place of a debt collector. The startup can also generate revenue by issuing loans and earning off of the interest. But Saltzman hopes to get enough users to start thinking creatively about how to make other forms of revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust is the biggest challenge,&#8221; said Saltzman. &#8220;We have to get into consumers houses and de-stigmatize this horrible problem. The solution is not there right now. The data shows us that one in three Americans is behind on their credit card bills right now. So we need them to trust us.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: An earlier version of this article stated that Verizon acquired Alley. It has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I write this, I have no fewer than five recently reviewed earbuds sitting on the desk in front of me. And you know what? They’re all pretty good. Some are better than others, of course — that’s why they invented gadget reviews. But as far as consumer electronics go, the category seemed to mature &#8212; and the products became ubiquitous &#8212; virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Nearly every hardware maker has entered the category — some several times over. You can get a truly great pair for over $200 and a pretty decent one for under $100. There’s a broad range in quality across that spectrum, of course. But features? A few things, here and there, but on the whole, earbuds settled into a similar sort of homogeneity as smartphones before them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172645" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172645" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172645" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172645" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Differentiation was certainly a big topic during today’s launch of Nothing’s Ear (1). It’s also been a core part of Nura’s DNA since the beginning. But where a company like Nothing views its earbuds as the first piece in a larger ecosystem, Nura is, simply put, a headphone company. And there’s a pretty simple reason behind that. Everything Nura does is built around its audio technology — something that’s held true since before I had the opportunity to try the original Nuraphones as a prototype with a big, unsightly circuit board attached.</p>
<p>Announced today, NuraTrue mark the company’s third entry into the headphone market, following the over-ear Nuraphones and the tethered Nuraloop. The “true,” one assumes, refers to the truly wireless design, abandoning the behind-the-neck design that gave last year’s Nuraloop their name.</p>
<p>The decision to launch earbuds with a wire seemed an odd one at the $199 price point four years after Apple released the first AirPods (the year Nura was founded). There were some practical technical concerns, and Nura made the most of them with a magnetic connector that lets them double as wired headphones/monitors (something I appreciated when I still took a couple plane rides a month).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172647" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172647" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172647" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9564.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172647" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>When I put the question of going fully wireless to Nura co-founder Dragan Petrovic, he answered,</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to release a fully wireless product only once we could ensure an outstanding user experience and (most importantly) outstanding sound quality. Fully wireless earbuds have been around for about 5 years now, but only recently has the underlying technology matured to the point of being able to do justice to the music. These improvements were delivered by the wireless chip providers, which is why many of the fully wireless products that have come out this year are considerably better than what was available before. For NuraTrue, we took the finally mature wireless technology provided by the chip makers and added Nura&#8217;s (or rather, the listener&#8217;s) personalized sound to deliver the best sound quality in the most convenient form factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s true that everyone and their uncle has offered their own take on the category, Nura’s entry wasn’t as simple as pulling together some off-the-shelf components. The company offers one of the more unique listening experiences, courtesy of on-board technology that beams sound into the wearer’s ear and reads back the faint transmissions that return.<br />
Per Nura,</p>
<blockquote><p>Encoded in the returning sound wave is information about how well you heard the sound that went in. The Nuraphone uses an extremely sensitive microphone to detect this returning sound wave, and a self-learning engine built into the Nuraphone to create your profile. No buttons or knobs. It all happens automatically and in about 60 seconds. It is a little bit magic.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2172649" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172649" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The experience is the same across the three devices, so we’ve written about it a few times. Essentially the system creates a sort of custom sonic fingerprint based on the reading it gets back and uses that to adjust the settings according. It does feel like a bit of wizardry the first time you try it, especially when you flip back and forth between the default and custom settings.</p>
<p>The original Nuraphones quickly became one of my most recommended headphones — a solid accomplishment for such a young hardware startup. Since the launch of the original over-ear headphones, however, I’ve been waiting to see what the company might be able to do in a fully wireless form factor. And on most accounts, I’d say the NuraTrue are a success.</p>
<p>The great sound is largely intact — a solid accomplishment. There are nuances you’ll hear in these headphones that you too often miss in comparably priced tech — subtle details that get lost in the mix with less balanced headphones. Of course, you’ll continue to lose other nuances depending on the source of the music you’re listening to. What Nura’s able to do is impressive, but not miraculous.</p>
<p>You do, obviously, lose something with the smaller size. The Nurphones’ big differentiator is the addition of a powerful, tactile bass, courtesy of the ear cups. This experience is accomplished to some extent by the immersion slider in the app, which is designed to adjust the experiential level provided by the buds. But again, there’s no replacing the cocooning effect of the over-ear cups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172646" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172646" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But listen, at this point I think we all implicitly understand that different form factors offer different compromises. Otherwise, we would only have one style of headphone. The NuraTrue are quite light — I was actually surprised, given their size. Each bud weighs 7.4 grams. They’re also extremely comfortable. As with other Nura products, the headphones will detect whether you have a tight seal when doing the initial testing. Of its three products, however, the NuraTrue gave me the least problems on that front.</p>
<p>As someone who frequently experiences ear pain from different buds, they’ve not given me an issue wearing them around effectively all day. The weight distribution and a design that you basically twist into your ear means they stay put quite well. I’ve had no issues with them falling out at the gym or on a few short runs.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling is decent. It’s not industry-leading by any stretch, but it gets the job done for sure. It’s a bit of an annoyance, however, that you have to go into the app to toggle it on and off — as well as the immersion feature. These things, coupled with the fundamental importance of sound profiles means the buds are tied to their app a lot more than other earbuds. It’s the price you pay for being different, I suppose.</p>
<p>The battery is rated at six hours on the buds and 24 with the case factored in. There’s no superfast charging here — it takes about 2.5 hours to get the case’s 500 mAh battery from zero to full. Likely that won’t be an issue unless you never remember to charge the thing or you’re planning to go on a couple of long-haul flights. The inclusion of four battery lights on the front of the case is a nice touch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172650" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172650" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>My biggest complaint here is a bit of a surprise to me. A majority of the headphones I’ve tested recently haven’t had any Bluetooth connectivity issues. Honestly, I’d thought we’d moved past that. While the NuraTrue isn’t using the latest version of Bluetooth (5.2), the 5.0 it does uses is the same version found in, say, the AirPods Pro (Apple, of course, has the decided advantage of making its own phone, operating system and chips). The connection is fine around the house, but I’ve experienced drops while walking around that I haven’t with other recent pairs.</p>
<p>It’s more annoying than end of the world, but it’s worth keeping in mind — and certainly something the company should consider addressing for gen 2. The built-in  microphone also left something to be desired, creating distortion when I took calls.</p>
<p>As from those, there’s really not a lot to complain about. The NuraTrue are well rounded (figuratively and literally), comfortable, and the company’s sound profiling technology is enough of a standout feature to set them apart from an army of similar buds. For my own specific needs, I’d say they also make the Nuraloop largely redundant, though Petrovic tells me, the company is keeping the product around as it, “complement[s] our product portfolio by offering things that no true wireless product has, most importantly 16+ hours of battery life, and the ability to connect to an analog audio jack.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172643" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172643" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Fair enough on those two points. Again, if any headphone did everything, there wouldn’t be much point in variety. On the whole, I do think NuraTrue carry the far broader appeal for a majority of users. The ability to hardwire has its appeal but is pretty limited for most of us at this point. And 16 hours of battery built-in is great, but most of the time six on the bud and 24 with the case should suffice.</p>
<p>Mostly, it’s just nice to see a legit hardware startup continue to make some waves in the consumer space by taking on the big names with differentiated technology. In the earliest days, I’d imagined Nura would get snapped up by a Samsung or Apple, but I’m glad the company opted to go its own way.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> Chris had prior Equity guest Phil Libin back for a chat. Libin was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/listen-to-us-talk-about-undercorns-ipos-and-what-going-public-is-really-about/">on our show a while back</a> to chat about his startup studio. But since then, he&#8217;s been a little busy.</p>
<p>You may recall that mmhmm, Libin&#8217;s project to build a better video communication service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">raised $100 million the other week</a>. And we here on the Equity pod made a little bit of fun at the number. It was just so very much money for a roughly one year old company. What was the company going to use it for?</p>
<p>Well, Libin&#8217;s folks got in touch and so we decided to just have him on to chat. And we wanted him back because he was one of the most memorable guests on the show, frankly, thanks to his candor the last time around.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into? A refresh on the mmhmm story, and notes from Libin about what&#8217;s ahead for his company. It certainly has the cash to pursue its vision. But as we learned, building software for a variety of platforms comes with challenges. Challenges that are ameliorated by having lots of smart staff. So, that&#8217;s where the money is going.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was good sporting of Libin to come back for another chat. Equity is back Friday morning with our news roundup. Make sure to follow the show on Twitter, as we&#8217;re doing the odd Twitter space that you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music rights giant ASCAP said today that a quartet of early-stage startups/university music projects will compete in its Immersive Music Studio Challenge. The 12-week project is a partnership between ASCAP Lab and NY Media Lab (NYCML) that offers the teams grants and access to development resources. They&#8217;ll also be showcasing at the upcoming <a href="http://www.ascapexperience.com">ASCAP Experience</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting little cohort, aiming to tackle some wide-ranging music industry issues. Some have already laid out commercialization plans, while others essentially came together for the program and really haven’t thought that far down the road.</p>
<p>We spoke to the founding teams to get a better sense of the projects.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s on your founding team? </strong></p>
<p>Boomy was founded by serial music entrepreneur Alex Jae Mitchell and music industry veteran Matthew Cohen Santorelli in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Music-making is a complex skill requiring time, equipment and resources that most people don’t have. Boomy is an AI-powered music automation platform where people create and release music instantly, effortlessly, and for free &#8212; even if they’ve never made music before. Over 200,000 people are already using Boomy to create and release music, 85% of whom are first-time music makers.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Through the Boomy platform, users release albums to 40+ streaming services and digital retailers worldwide, including Spotify, TikTok, YouTube, Apple Music and more &#8212; all for free. Users keep an 80% share of the associated royalties, with the remaining 20% used by Boomy to power the free service.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date? </strong></p>
<p>Boomy graduated from the Boost VC accelerator in 2019 and has raised follow-on funding from venture capital firms and music funds, but has not yet made a formal announcement regarding its fundraising.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2182064" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182064" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60b03b12cdfa239a0a8000d0_9bbb582773599b1ea69cac93bf416178.gif" alt="" width="686" height="420" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MiSynth</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s on your founding team? </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth began as a fictional business proposal created by Senaida Ng in her freshman year class, “Are Friends Electric?” taught by professor Errol Kolosine. After the class ended, Ng continued with the idea and worked closely with Kolosine to bring the idea to life. She recruited Ph.D. biomedical engineer Sinem Eriksen to lead the R&amp;D alongside the guidance of NYU Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) researchers Pablo Ripollés and Elena Georgieva.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth is a revolutionary music software plugin that will allow musicians, songwriters and producers to synthesize any sounds they hear in their heads. They will bridge the gap between your imagination and your music by taking data from brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and turning them into playable MIDI instruments. The team at MiSynth strongly believes that everyone can and should have the tools to be an artist. Rather than spending hours learning about sound design and trying to re-create the perfect synth, MiSynth is making music more accessible and efficient for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we plan on continuing to build our prototype and testing it after the ASCAP NYCML Challenge and we hope to launch our software by August 2024. MiSynth will be sold as a software plugin compatible with any digital audio workstation (DAW), including Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, Pro Tools, FL Studio, Cubase and Reason. Customers can buy the license to use the software by paying either a one-time fee or a monthly subscription fee until they pay off the full price of the license.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date?</strong></p>
<p>We are a relatively new company that began only in December 2020, but we plan on continuing to seek funding from investors, research grants and challenges like the ASCAP NYCML Challenge to continue our venture.</p>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s on your founding team? </strong></p>
<p>Kate Stevenson, Elizabeth Perez, Chris White and Jacques Foottit.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong></p>
<p>Social is a best-in-class online event platform where users can easily meet and chat with other people while exploring virtual spaces with games and live performances. We saw the need to bring serendipitous social moments and ways to spark real-life relationships into the remote, virtual experience, especially at events and live performances.</p>
<p>Every world comes with proximity-activated audio, live-streaming avatars, beautiful customizable visuals and unique brand opportunities. With options to showcase video content, host a social livestream, add entertaining challenges and game packages so attendees and audience members connect through playful exploration and leave wowed by the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Social is being used commercially for product launches, conferences, team-building events, art exhibitions and performances. Revenue streams include monetization through ticketing, donation widgets and sponsorship packages. Our commercial clients include fashion and beauty brands, media, tech and finance.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined how we think about virtual communication and experiences. We have seen a level of behavioral change that would typically take more than 10 years happen in just 12 months. There is now a viable market for virtual engagement and therefore an opportunity to consider a hybrid approach for how we can engage audiences as we move out of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date? </strong></p>
<p>We are currently funded through white-labeled development for event companies and brands. Social is growing organically based on user needs, through pilots with physical venues, artists and passionate communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice-based and other personal assistant apps &#8212; which use natural language and hefty AI engines in the backend to source information to address your various questions, do your e-commerce bidding, or control one electronic device or another in your home &#8212; have been around for years, but too often they have come up short when it comes to user experience, failing to nail the right solutions to your queries. Today a new app is launching from a startup that has largely been in stealth mode up to now to try to address that disparity. <a href="https://brain.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain Technologies</a> is today announcing $50 million in funding, and along with that is releasing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/natural-simply-get-anything/id1521375720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural</a>, an iOS app, in the US market.</p>
<p>The $50 million (which is actually described as &#8220;over $50 million&#8221; by the company, with an exact number undisclosed), meanwhile, is coming from a very interesting mix of investors &#8212; backers include Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; Emerson Collective, Goodwater Capital, Scott Cook and WTT Investment, a list that underscores some of the attention that Brain has been getting, even before having released a single product.</p>
<p>Prior to this round, Brain had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/meet-brain-the-ai-engine-that-wants-to-replace-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million back in 2016</a> from an unnamed investor while still in stealth mode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jerry Yue, the young founder and CEO of Brain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and robotics enthusiast whose last company, a grocery delivery service in China called Benlai, is <a href="https://www.benlai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still going strong</a> &#8212; said in an interview that he does not like to call Natural a &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; app, not because of the shortcomings of so many of these in the past, but because of the voice association many have with the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t position ourselves as a voice assistant because we don’t think the future is voice only,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It should be the right combination of voice and native app experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, he describes what Natural is as the world&#8217;s first &#8220;generative computer interface&#8221;, the logical progression in digital information search.</p>
<p>That progression, in his view, started with the web, progressed to search engines, and then apps, before landing where he sees it today. Natural brings all of these together in some degree. Currently, you speak or type any kind of question or command into the app, which then provides a solution that might be in the form of links to other apps you might have.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;I&#8217;d like sushi tonight,&#8221; will bring back options (in theory) for ordering sushi, and possibly your most favored dishes, from a selection of restaurants by way of food ordering apps that you use, or places to go eat it, as well as options for making that sushi yourself (and buying the ingredients online to do so, as well as a method).</p>
<p>Similarly, travel searches return results that dip into multiple silos from, say, airlines and airline aggregators that are easily editable and that you can buy directly from those results, if you already have payment details on your device. (While Google provides this to some degree, you eventually have to navigate to sites to buy tickets, which might end up significantly more expensive when you actually visit said sites.)</p>
<p>The more you use the app, the theory is that it will learn more about what you might want from your questions.</p>
<p>AI that anticipates what we are trying to say or do is something that has been attempted before, of course, but the difference here, Yue said, is in Brain&#8217;s approach, which is based on the concept of &#8220;one shot&#8221; learning, which he described as a kind of general purpose AI, &#8220;a tool that learns to use other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alternative is a more labor-intensive approach that AI-based systems are typically built on today, largely based around keywords. &#8220;AIs from Google or Amazon are based on thousands of people and human coding to connect services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This approach treats natural language processing as a classification problem.&#8221; In contrast, the breakthrough system he and his team have devised, he said, &#8220;has learned more than 4 million functions on its own.&#8221; Ironically, the end result of a successful AI like this is not to make us feel more technologically powerful, but to get us away from our devices, and spending time fussing on them, and into the world.</p>
<p>Given that this is a consumer app, it will be interesting to see how and if there is mass takeup of Natural, and whether the right combination of anticipatory AI with natural language and design come together to pique collective attention. The team and what they&#8217;ve built in any case will be a hot property, given that AI will continue to be a strong and growing presence in the tech landscape for years to come.</p>
<p>“What Jerry and his team are developing is incredibly special. I’m not aware of anyone doing more interesting work to demonstrate how fundamentally AI can enhance our everyday lives,” said investor Scott Cook, who was also the founder of financial software giant Intuit, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Many of us remember the first time we used an iPhone. The software felt magical, and every animation felt dynamic yet subtle,” said Tom Goodwin, a Natural beta customer. “Experiencing this app is the closest thing I’ve felt to that for a long time. I love the idea of one place to go for everything.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/">shared his aspirations</a> last year to turn the startup he co-founded in 2017 into one of the world’s major battery recycling companies. Now, the former Tesla co-founder and CTO has the money to accelerate those plans.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials said Wednesday it raised $700 million from high-profile institutional investors and venture firms, providing the capital needed to expand its existing operations well beyond its Carson City, Nevada, home base to locations throughout North America and even into Europe.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates and included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Fidelity. Previous investors &#8212; Capricorn&#8217;s Technology Impact Fund, Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund &#8212; returned to put more capital into Redwood. Valor Equity Partners, Emerson Collective and Franklin Templeton also participated, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood previously raised $40 million in a Series B and some seed money, which brings its total raise under $800 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round. Redwood declined to comment on the figure.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel said, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Redwood recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC&#8217;s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our view, the need for these materials will grow exponentially over time as we enter the era of de-carbonization,&#8221; Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, said in a statement, adding that &#8220;Redwood is well-positioned to be at the forefront of tackling this emerging and critically important problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straubel sees a bottleneck coming as the whole supply chain seeks to access critical materials. That will affect the growth rate and challenge automakers like Ford, GM and Volkswagen that have laid out ambitious plans to electrify their portfolios.</p>
<p>That problem is likely to compound as more automakers go down the electric path. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">Mercedes-Benz said</a> it will spend €40 billion ($47 billion) to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade. The German automaker determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt-hours. To meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</p>
<p>Straubel said it&#8217;s time for Redwood to scale more aggressively.</p>
<p>Those plans were already well underway even before it closed the $700 million round, Straubel noted. The company announced in June it had purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. Redwood now has some operations at the site.</p>
<p>Redwood is also in the process of nearly tripling the size of its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada. The new 400,000-square-foot addition onto the recycling facility is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To support the growth, Redwood started hiring more employees, with plans to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years. Redwood employs more than 130 people today.</p>
<p>The company has expanded in other ways as well, including the launch of a program that allows consumers to send in personal electronics such as smartphones to be recycled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This additional equity to some extent helps us finish all those things, but it&#8217;s not really the primary purpose for all of it,&#8221; Straubel said.</p>
<p>The company is examining additional sites in North America and actively looking at entering the European market, he added without providing a specific timeline. He did say that for now, Redwood is focused on the North American and European markets. Asia would be its third market.</p>
<p>Redwood is also investing money into some large-scale projects that seek further improve its recycling process, specifically around material purification and how to most effectively get these raw materials back into the battery supply chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Noetic Cyber, a cloud-based continuous cyber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/asset-management/">asset management</a> and controls platform, has launched from stealth with a Series A funding round of $15 million led by Energy Impact Partners.</p>
<p>The round was also backed by Noetic’s existing investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ten-eleven-ventures/">TenEleven Ventures</a> and GlassWing Ventures, and brings the total amount of funds raised by the startup to $20 million following a $5 million seed round. Shawn Cherian, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, will join the Noetic board, while Niloofar Razi Howe, a senior operating partner at the investment firm, will join Noetic&#8217;s advisory board.</p>
<p>“Noetic is a true market disruptor, offering an innovative way to fix the cyber asset visibility problem — a growing and persistent challenge in today’s threat landscape,” said Howe.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts-based startup claims to be taking a new approach to the cyber asset management problem. Unlike traditional solutions, Noetic is not agent-based, instead using<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>API aggregation and correlation to draw insights from multiple security and IT management tools.</p>
<p>“What makes us different is that we’re putting orchestration and automation at the heart of the solution, so we’re not just showing security leaders that they have problems, but we’re helping them to fix them,” Paul Ayers, CEO and co-founder of Noetic Cyber tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ayer was previously a top exec at PGP Corporation (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/symantec-shells-out-370-million-for-data-encryption-companies-pgp-and-guardianedge/">acquired by Symantec for $370 million</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vormetric/">Vormetric</a> (acquired by Thales for $400 million) and founded Noetic Cyber with Allen Roger and Allen Hadden, who have previously worked at cybersecurity vendors including Authentica, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/raptor/">Raptor</a> and Axent. All three were also integral to the development of Resilient Systems, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/29/ibm-adds-post-cyber-attack-planning-with-resilient-systems-acquisition/">which was acquired by IBM</a>.</p>
<p>“The founding team’s experience in the security, orchestration, automation and response market gives us unique experience and insights to make automation a key pillar of the solution,” Ayers said. “Our model gives you the certainty to make automation possible, the goal is to find and fix problems continuously, getting assets back to a secure state.”</p>
<p>“The development of the technology has been impacted by the current cyber landscape, and the pandemic, as some of the market drivers we’ve seen around the adoption of cloud services, and the increased use of unmanaged devices by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote workers</a>, are driving a great need for accurate cyber asset discovery and management.”</p>
<p>The company, which currently has 20 employees, says it plans to use the newly raised funds to double its headcount by the end of the year, as well as increase its go-to-market capability in the U.S. and the U.K. to grow its customer base and revenue growth.</p>
<p>“In terms of technology development, this investment allows us to continue to add development and product management talent to the team to build on our cyber asset management platform,” Ayers said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The beauty of our approach is that it allows us to easily add more applications and use cases on top of our core asset visibility and management model. We will continue to add more connectors to support customer use cases and will be bringing a comprehensive controls package to market later in 2021, as well as a community edition in 2022.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot is tackling affordable healthcare with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a compliment to traditional health insurance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Affordable healthcare continues to be a major problem in the U.S., with roughly 30 million people without comprehensive healthcare and high medical costs causing many to go into debt. <a href="https://www.getspot.com/">Spot</a> is tackling this issue with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a complement to traditional health insurance.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Austin, the company raised $15 million in equity and $2.5 million in debt in a round of seed funding led by GreatPoint Ventures, with participation from Montage Ventures, Mutual of Omaha, MS&amp;AD and Silverton Partners.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came from a conversation founder Maria Goy and Matt Randall had back in 2018. Randall is married to Goy’s best friend, and one night, they started talking about Goy’s job at the time, in insurance at New York Life, and how there needed to be a product that provided affordable insurance. That led to a discussion about how to also have healthcare that was accessible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every major market was disrupted by some change of distribution, like Netflix and Airbnb,” Goy told TechCrunch. “We are setting the foundation to drive change and the distribution of insurance.”</p>
<p>Spot’s business model takes a holistic approach by providing customized injury insurance policies through both direct-to-consumer and strategic partnerships with companies and organizations. For example, one of the company’s first partners was the Austin Marathon, selling one-time injury policies to the participants. Randall wasn‘t sure if people would buy them, but they ended up selling over 1,100 policies.</p>
<p>That led to applying the same idea across youth sports, ski resorts and cycling organizations. It now has over a dozen partners, including USA Cycling, Powder Mountain, USA BMX, National Ski Patrol and athleteReg, and covers tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>The policies start at $25 and work like a monthly subscription. Family plans are also available. Spot covers up to $20,000 each time the customer is injured. The company will also coordinate with any existing healthcare insurance. Customers can use any licensed physician, hospital or urgent care clinic.</p>
<p>Spot has grown 800% in policies from last year and 300% in partnerships, including bringing on Mutual of Omaha. Spot is the first startup the insurance giant has invested in, and “having them alongside Maria is beyond a powerhouse team to say the least,” Randall said.</p>
<p>The company’s policies are available in 42 states via the DTC model and nationwide on group coverage, Goy said. The new funding round will be used to triple Spot’s team of 25, go after new partnerships and develop a go-to-market strategy. Randall also plans to raise a Series A round in the next nine months.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on bringing additional products that fill in holes and gaps in insurance and provide more education to the market,” Goy added. “We are getting requests for alternative coverage. For example, people would rather have acupuncture instead of surgery, which is not easy for a typical policy. Ultimately, our big mission is how to create a community within our customers and drive engagement.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Mike McCormick, principal at GreatPoint Ventures, will join Spot’s board of directors. He said in an interview that his firm is on the lookout for things that make healthcare better, including companies rooted in rethinking how to keep people well.</p>
<p>Spending much of his time in both healthcare and insurtech, McCormick wanted to find an answer to the problem of how the U.S. is spending so much money, on a per capita basis, and getting what he called “meh results.”</p>
<p>There are also the issues of most care being fee-for-service, and insurance for most people being attached to employment, while high deductibles have become a big feature, he said. He likes Spot because it is offering a product, for example, to someone young who is unlikely to get diabetes or cancer soon, but could incur $10,000 in medical costs breaking a leg skiing.</p>
<p>“What Spot is doing for the underinsured and uninsured makes sense,” McCormick added. “Maria and Matt are incredible people building an incredible company with growth and product-market fit. In terms of the partnership and direct-to-consumer models, they could build either one into a $10 billion company and both will work.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A slew of launch startups have emerged in recent years to help meet growing demand from satellite providers, biotech companies and others looking to send payload to space. One such startup is Germany’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/">Isar Aerospace Technologies</a>, which is focused on building orbital launch vehicles designed to carry up to 1,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The startup made headlines last December – including here at TechCrunch – for scoring a $91 million Series B, the largest round to date in the European space launch scene. Now the company says it has raised an additional $75 million in a Series B extension, bringing the total round to over $165 million.</p>
<p>The extension round was led by HV Capital, Porsche SE and banking group Lombard Odier. Existing investors Earlybird Venture Capital, Lakestar, Vsquared Ventures, Apeiron Investment Group and UVC Partners also participated, with Earlybird subscribing the largest amount. Earlybird and Airbus Ventures led Isar’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/article.php?id=2019121001">$17 million Series A</a> in December 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Participation by Porsche SE – a major shareholder of Volkswagen – is particularly interesting as it signals growing interest from established mobility investors in connectivity and space-enabled technologies.</p>
<p>“As an investor focusing on mobility and industrial technology, we are convinced that cost-effective and flexible access to space will be a key enabler for innovations in traditional industries as well as for new and disruptive technologies and business models,” Porsche SE executive board member Lutz Meschke said in a statement. “Therefore, we are excited to back Isar Aerospace on its way to become the leading European small-launcher and to meet the increasing appetite for launch services.”</p>

<p>The funding will likely provide a significant boost for continued development and manufacturing as the company nears its planned first test flight in 2022.</p>
<p>Isar began production of its inaugural launch vehicle, the Spectrum rocket, this year. Spectrum is a two-stage vehicle that’s designed for lightweight delivery to low Earth orbit. The idea is to create a launcher that can move quickly and at a low cost to small satellite companies. Isar is aiming to conduct engine tests in Kiruna, Sweden, and launch operations in nearby Andøya, Norway, thanks to a 20-year agreement with Andøya Space for exclusive access to one of its launch pads. Notably, Isar has already secured its first paying customer, Airbus Defence and Space, and said in a statement that it plans on announcing more contracts soon.</p>
<p>The startup was spun out of Munich Technical University, where co-founders Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl were studying engineering. While many of the new wave of launch companies are based in the United States, Isar is leading a parallel wave in Germany.</p>
<p>“A competitive and diverse space ecosystem will be crucial for humanity in the decades to come,” Isar CEO Daniel Metzler said in a statement. “We are convinced that European cooperation, a level-playing field for all players, and a demand-driven approach will provide customers with access to different and internationally competitive launch capabilities for a broad spectrum of payloads. The US has shown that cornerstone contracts based on demand – instead of political parameters – are preparing the ground for innovation and growth in the space sector.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European customer engagement platform <a href="https://dixa.com/">Dixa</a> has raised a Series C funding round of $105 million, led by growth equity investor General Atlantic. Existing investors Notion Capital, Project A, and Seed Capital also participated. In February last year, it raised $36 million in Series B funding, led by Notion Capital, with support from existing investors Project A and Seed.</p>
<p>As well a product development, Dixa plans to use the cash injection as a war chest to roll-up other products. It already acquired Melbourne-based Elevio in January 2021.</p>
<p>Founded in Denmark in 2015 and launched in 2018, Dixa says it enables brands to stay connected with customers via messaging, live chat, email, or voice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mads Fosselius, founder and CEO of Dixa said: “For today’s customers, channels have ceased to matter. The way they engage now is holistically blended into what is called ‘multiexperience’. This is how we’re empowering brands to continuously stay true to their values.</p>
<p>Tom Hussey, Vice President in General Atlantic’s Technology sector focused on B2B software added: “Customer service software is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from disjointed, transactional approaches towards longitudinal, conversational engagement. Dixa has helped to define and lead this multiexperience approach.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's digital therapy platform works to measure and improve someone’s ability to walk after they have experienced a neurologic injury or disease.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.medrhythms.com/">MedRhythms</a> secured $25 million in Series B funding to advance its digital therapy platform aimed at measuring and improving someone’s ability to walk after they have experienced a neurologic injury or disease.</p>
<p>Morningside Ventures and Advantage Capital co-led the round, with participation from existing investor Werth Family Investment Associates, to give the Portland, Maine-based company $31 million in funding to date.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Brian Harris was a neurologic music fellow at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, treating people with stroke and brain deficits with music. He began getting questions from patients and families on how they could access similar care outside of the hospital. Not seeing a suitable alternative, he started MedRhythms with entrepreneur Owen McCarthy in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s platform uses sensors, music and software, along with an evidence-based intervention called “rhythmic auditory stimulation,” to target the neural circuitry that controls movement. The technology taps into “entrainment,” a neurologic process in which the auditory and motor systems of the brain are coupled in synchrony with an external rhythmic cue, which over time, can lead to improved walking functionalities.</p>
<p>“There is no other stimulus that engages the brain like music does,” Harris said. “When someone is engaging in music, it aids in neuroplasticity to create new connections and strengthen old ones. Neuroplasticity is how we can learn new things or why people with brain deficits can improve.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182726" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182726" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg 1386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182726" class="wp-caption-text">MedRhythms&#8217; product cycle. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MedRhythms</p></div></p>
<p>A year ago, MedRhythms’ digital therapeutic product received Breakthrough Device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat chronic walking deficits resulting from a stroke. It is the first in the company’s pipeline, which is also looking at using music to treat neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, acute stroke and multiple sclerosis. To that effect, it is participating in a neuroimaging study with Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>Harris intends to use the proceeds from the Series B funding to get the product to market, expand the team and the treatment pipeline. The company is preparing for submission to the FDA so it can do a commercial launch of the technology and begin clinical trials.</p>
<p>Stephen Bruso, investment partner at Morningside, said he has known the team at MedRhythms for a year. The firm is active in the digital health space and has followed the company closely since then.</p>
<p>COVID served to fundamentally shift healthcare in how to deliver care. The hospital and clinic models were robust, but resistant to change until the pandemic forced care to telemedicine visits at home, he said. It also forced innovation on the industry, and at-home therapy is an area where Bruso expects to see improvement in both patient compliance and recovery, and MedRhythms is capitalizing on that trend of shifting care to the home.</p>
<p>What intrigued the firm for the last couple of months was the idea of affecting the brain via non-pharmaceutical needs.</p>
<p>“MedRhythms using musical intervention to drive changes and improvements in neurologics is compelling,” Bruso added. “Emotional memory is tied to music. Its use provides a richer experience than taking a drug, and the company exists to tap into that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.algolia.com">Algolia</a> has raised a $150 million Series D funding round at a post-money valuation of $2.25 billion. Compared to the Series C round from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/algolia-finds-110m-from-accel-and-salesforce-for-its-search-as-a-service-used-by-slack-twitch-and-8k-others/">October 2019</a>, the company’s valuation has more than quadrupled. It means that Algolia is now a unicorn with a valuation above $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its search-as-a-service product. It lets you integrate real-time search in your app or website using a developer-friendly API. Using an Algolia-powered search feature feels like using Spotlight on a Mac. Results load with each keystroke and appear in just a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>The company now has over 10,000 customers, including some big names, such as Slack, Stripe, Medium, Zendesk and Lacoste. Right now, the company handles over 1.5 trillion search queries per year — that’s a 1,500,000,000,000 if you want to see all the zeros.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lone Pine Capital is leading today’s funding round. Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, STEADFAST Capital Ventures, Glynn Capital and Twilio also participated in the round. But that’s not all, some existing investors also put more money on the table, such as Accel, Salesforce Ventures, DAG, Owl Rock and World Innovation Lab.</p>
<p>While the company doesn’t share revenue numbers directly, Algolia says that its annual recurring revenue has increased by 180% year over year.</p>
<p>“The future is API-first – a reality underscored by the growth seen by Twilio, Stripe, Algolia and others in the API economy. A huge part of our success has, and will continue to be, our relentless focus on developers with our PLG strategy — enabling them to build search into their websites and apps, so they create the most relevant and dynamic digital experiences.” Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon said in a statement. “And we’re excited to continue to solve customers&#39; problems as we continue to expand beyond search with Algolia Recommend and Predict.”</p>
<p>In addition to its search API, Algolia has expanded to other real-time APIs. For instance, you can provide real-time product recommendations on your e-commerce website with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/products/recommendations/">Algolia Recommend</a>. This is part of a strategy to diversify the company’s product offering.</p>
<p>In particular, the company is now trying to analyze the visitor’s intent to predict whether they’re likely to purchase something on not. Companies can then leverage that info to refresh content dynamically, send a push notification, display a special offer, etc.</p>
<p>Originally founded in France, the company has grown tremendously over the past few years. Algolia is now a big enterprise-focused company with a solid business. Last year, its co-founder and CEO Nicolas Dessaigne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/algolia-gets-a-new-ceo-as-founder-steps-down/">decided</a> to transition to a non-operational role.</p>
<p>And the company has recruited quite a few senior executives over the past 18 months — Michelle Adams (chief revenue officer, formerly of Dropbox), Carlton Baab (chief financial officer, formerly of Alfresco), Piyush Patel (chief business development officer, formerly of Capgemini), Jim Schattin (chief customer officer, formerly of Alteryx), Jason McClelland (chief marketing officer, formerly of Salesforce and Adobe) and Bharat Guruprakash (chief product officer, formerly of Twilio).</p>
<p>As you can see, it’s a long list of talented people, which means that Algolia is focused on building a long-term company instead of building cool technology and optimizing for an acquisition. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn about an IPO down the road.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down over 3,000 available plans into a handful of best choices based on their care requirements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employers typically offer three options for healthcare insurance. When it&#8217;s time to switch to Medicare, particularly Medicare Advantage, there are over <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2021-spotlight-first-look/">3,500 plans available</a> nationwide, and an average of 30 plans someone can choose from in their particular area. Connie Health is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down those 3,000 plans into a handful of best choices based on care requirements.</p>
<p>The company’s three co-founders, Oded Eran, CEO, David Luna, chief revenue officer, and Michael Scopa, chief growth officer, saw this problem firsthand as executives at primary care company Iora Health, which is <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/one-medical-to-acquire-iora-health-2-1b-all-stock-deal">being acquired by OneMedical</a> for $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>They started their company in 2019 to develop a Medicare concierge service to assist seniors in easily navigating through those 30 plans to find the right one for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We were coming from the provider side and understood that though healthcare is local, people don’t know the difference in hospitals or the ins and outs of local networks,” Eran told TechCrunch. “Seniors need trust there, and when there are local advisers to meet over the phone or at home, you gain that trust.”</p>
<p>The Boston-based company announced Wednesday it raised $13 million in Series A funding led by Khosla Ventures and Pittango Healthtech to give it a total of $16 million in funding. The company raised $3 million in a seed round back in January 2020, also led by Khosla. The seed and Series A rounds also saw participation by AbstractVentures, Dynamic Loop Capital, Arkitekt Ventures, as well as a group of angel investors, including Hippo Insurance CEO Assaf Wand and Flatiron Health founders Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182660" style="width: 982px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182660" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png" alt="" width="972" height="608" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connie-health-medicare-consumer-platform.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182660" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Connie Health</p></div></p>
<p>With 55 million Medicare consumers benefiting from major innovation in Medicare Advantage and value-based care, Kaul saw a large market that was being disrupted by Connie Health. He was especially impressed with the team Eran built and how the company was able to launch during the pandemic and stay nimble.</p>
<p>“The Medicare Advantage space is rich and will continue to grow,” Kaul added. “Technology has not played a big role here, and Oded is going to bring technology in to make the market more efficient.”</p>
<p>Medicare Advantage is the private market part of the insurance program. Eran said the government is trying to drive competition and innovation, so there are a lot of new players coming in to create more plan options, more nuances and to help manage costs better. On the consumer level, this creates a lot of confusion, he added. Potential customers have a hard time making decisions on the latest and greatest options, so they tend to stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>That’s where Connie Health comes in. The company’s technology takes into account the providers someone sees, the medications they are on and the benefits they would like to have, feed those into its model, and based on that, sifts through the thousands of plans available and recommends the best fits.</p>
<p>Four months ago, Connie Health kicked off its consumer platform in Arizona, and with the new investment, also began operating in Texas. Over the next year, Eran expects to move into Illinois, where he is seeing big demographic changes as a lot of people are moving into Medicare and other states. The new funding will also enable the company to branch off to other insurance products.</p>
<p>Within those states, the company’s footprint grew to seven markets, and its local agent base grew 15 times.</p>
<p>“We are going to democratize access to the local agents to help people make these often tough decisions and find healthcare that they deserve and have paid for all of their working life,” Eran said. “We are taking this market-by-market approach because healthcare is in the community.”</p>
