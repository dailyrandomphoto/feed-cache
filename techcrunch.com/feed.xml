										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/07/the-content-you-care-about-simplified-and-reinvented-introducing-microsoft-start/">introducing</a> its own personalized news reading experience called Microsoft Start, available as both a website and mobile app, in addition to being integrated with other Microsoft products, including Windows 10 and 11 and its Microsoft Edge web browser. The feed will combine content from news publishers, but in a way that&#8217;s tailored to users&#8217; individual interests, the company says &#8212; a customization system that could help Microsoft to better compete with the news reading experiences offered by rivals like Apple or Google, as well as popular third-party apps like Flipboard or SmartNews.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the product builds on the company&#8217;s legacy with online and mobile consumer services like MSN and Microsoft News. However, it won&#8217;t replace MSN. That service will remain available, despite the launch of this new, in-house competitor.</p>
<p>To use Microsoft Start, consumers can visit the standalone website <a href="https://www.microsoftstart.com/">MicrosoftStart.com</a>, which works on both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (but not Safari), or they can download the Microsoft Start mobile app for iOS or Android.</p>
<p>The service will also power the News and Interests experience on the Windows 10 taskbar and the Widgets experience on Windows 11. In Microsoft Edge, it will be available from the New Tab page, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198883" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198883" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198883" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MobileAppPlusIcon_800x600.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198883" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>At first glance, the Microsoft Start website it very much like any other online portal offering a collection of news from a variety of publishers, alongside widgets for things like weather, stocks, sports scores and traffic. When you click to read an article, you&#8217;re taken to a syndicated version hosted on Microsoft&#8217;s domain, which includes the Microsoft Start top navigation bar at the top and emoji reaction buttons below the headline.</p>
<p>Users can also <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">react to stories with emojis while browsing the home page itself. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This emoji set is similar to the one being offered today by Facebook, except that Microsoft has replaced Facebook&#8217;s controversial laughing face emoji with a thinking face. (It&#8217;s worth noting that the Facebook laughing face has been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvezb/laughing-crying-emoji-divisive-gen-z-mums">increasingly</a> <a href="https://projectauthenticity.org/2020/08/06/the-laughing-reaction-has-made-facebook-even-more-toxic/">criticized</a> for being used to openly ridicule posts and mock people  &#8212; even on stories depicting tragic events, like Covid deaths, for instance.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Microsoft has made another change with its emoji, as well: after you react to a story with an emoji, you only see your emoji instead of the top three and total reaction count. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198884" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198884" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198884" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Managing-Interests.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The feed will adjust to users&#8217; interests in several different ways.</p>
<p>Users can click a &#8220;Personalize&#8221; button to be taken to a page where they can manually add and remove interests from across a number of high-level categories like news, entertainment, sports, technology, money, finance, travel, health, shopping, and more. Or they can search for categories and interests that could be more specific or more niche. (Instead of &#8220;parenting,&#8221; for instance, &#8220;parenting teenagers.&#8221;)  This recalls the recent update <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/flipboard-rolls-out-newsfeed-personalization-tools-to-save-you-from-doomscrolling/">Flipboard made to its own main page, the For You feed</a>, which lets users make similar choices.</p>
<p>As users then begin to browse their Microsoft Start feed, they can also click a button to thumbs up or thumbs down an article to better adjust the feed to their preferences. Over time, the more the user engages with the content, the better refined the feed becomes, says Microsoft. This customization will leverage A.I. and machine learning, as well as human moderation, the company notes.</p>
<p>The feed, like other online portals, is supported by advertising. As you scroll down, you&#8217;ll notice every few rows will feature one ad unit, where the URL is flagged with a green &#8220;Ad&#8221; badge. Initially, these mostly appear to be product ads, making them distinct from the news content. Since Microsoft isn&#8217;t shutting down MSN and is integrating this news service into a number of other products, it&#8217;s expanding the available advertising real estate it can offer with this launch.</p>
<p>The website, app and integrations are rolling out starting today. (If you aren&#8217;t able to find the app yet, you can try scanning the QR code from your mobile device.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just like the automotive industry, aerospace has its sights set on going electric — but flying with battery-powered engines is a tougher proposition than rolling. <a href="https://www.weflywright.com/">Wright</a> is among the startups looking to change the math and make electrified flight possible at scales beyond small aircraft — and its 2-megawatt engine could power the first generation of large-scale electric passenger planes.</p>
<p>Electric cars have proven to be a huge success, but they have an advantage over planes in that they don&#8217;t need to produce enough lift to keep their own mass in the air. Electric planes have been held back by this fundamental conundrum, that the weight of the batteries needed to fly any distance with passengers aboard means the plane is too heavy to fly in the first place.</p>
<p>In order to escape this conundrum, the main thing to improve is efficiency: how much thrust can be produced per watt of power. Since reducing the mass of batteries is a long, slow process, it&#8217;s better to innovate in other ways: materials, airframe, and of course the engine, which in traditional jets is a huge, immensely heavy and complex internal combustion one.</p>
<p>Electric engines are generally lighter, simpler, and more reliable than fuel-powered ones, but in order to achieve flight you need to reach a certain level of efficiency. After all, if a jet burned a thousand gallons of fuel per second, the plane couldn&#8217;t hold the amount needed to take off. So it falls to companies like Wright and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/h3x-rethinks-the-electric-motor-to-power-the-next-phase-of-mobility/">H3x</a> to build electric engines that can produce more thrust from the same amount of stored energy.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;H3X rethinks the electric motor to power the next phase of mobility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/h3x-rethinks-the-electric-motor-to-power-the-next-phase-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=EFSfEL7Eb1" data-secret="EFSfEL7Eb1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While H3x is focused on small aircraft that will probably be taking flight sooner, Wright founder Jeff Engler explained that if you want to take on aerospace&#8217;s carbon footprint, you really have to start looking at commercial passenger jets — and Wright is planning to make one. Fortunately, despite the company&#8217;s name, they don&#8217;t need to build it <em>entirely</em> from scratch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not reinventing the concept of the wing, or the fuselage, or anything like that. What changes is what propels the aircraft forward,&#8221; said Engler. He likened it to electric vehicles in that much of the car doesn&#8217;t change when you go electric, mainly the parts that have operated the same way in principle for a century. All the same, integrating a new propulsion system into a plane isn&#8217;t trivial.</p>
<p>Wright&#8217;s engine is a 2 megawatt motor that produces the equivalent of 2,700 horsepower, at an efficiency of around 10 kilowatts per kilogram. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most powerful motor designed for the electric aerospace industry by a factor of 2, and it&#8217;s substantially lighter than anything out there,&#8221; said Engler.</p>
<p>The lightness comes from a ground-up redesign using a permanent magnet approach with &#8220;an aggressive thermal strategy,&#8221; he explained. A higher voltage than is normally employed for aerospace purposes and an insulation system to match enable an engine that hits the power and efficiency levels required to put a large plane in flight.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198878" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2198878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png" alt="CG render of a plane using Wright's engines" width="1024" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=300,109 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=768,280 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=680,248 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=1536,559 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wright-concept.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2198878" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wright</p></div></p>
<p>Wright is making sure its engines can be used by retrofitted aircraft, but it&#8217;s also working on a plane of its own with established airframe makers. This first craft would be a hybrid electric, combining the lightweight, efficient propulsion stack with the range of a liquid fuel engine. Relying on hydrogen complicates things but it makes for a much faster transition to electric flight and a huge reduction in emissions and fuel use.</p>
<p>Several of Wright&#8217;s motors would be attached to each wing of the proposed aircraft, providing at least two benefits. First, redundancy. Planes with two huge engines are designed to be capable of flying even if one fails. If you have six or eight engines, one failing isn&#8217;t nearly so catastrophic, and as a consequence the plane doesn&#8217;t need to carry twice as much engine as you need. Second is the stability and noise reduction that comes from having multiple engines that can be adjusted individually or in concert to reduce vibration and counteract turbulence.</p>
<p>Right now the motor is in lab testing at sea level, and once it passes those tests (some time next year is the plan) it will be run in an altitude simulation chamber and then up at 40,000 feet for real. This is a long term project, but an entire industry doesn&#8217;t change overnight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Engler was emphatic about the enthusiasm and support the company has received from the likes of NASA and the military, both of which have provided considerable cash, material and expertise. When I brought up the idea that the company&#8217;s engine might end up in a new bombing drone, he said he was sensitive to that possibility, but that what he&#8217;s seen (and is aiming for) is much more in line with the defense department&#8217;s endless cargo and personnel flights. The military is a huge polluter, it turns out, and they want to change that — and cut down on how much money they spend on fuel every year as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of how things changed when we went from propellers to jets,&#8221; said Engler. &#8220;It redefined how an airplane operates. This new propulsion tech allows for reshaping the entire industry.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A jury will soon decide whether former <a href="http://www.apple.com">Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes is guilty of a federal crime</a>. But the deeper public policy questions that Theranos raised remain unanswered. How did a startup built on a technology that never worked grow to a valuation of $9 billion? How was the company able to conceal its fraud for so long? And what, if anything, can be done to prevent the next Theranos before it grows large enough to cause real harm—and burns capital that could have been invested in genuine innovations? I explore these questions in a forthcoming paper in the Indiana Law Journal titled <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3801131">Taming Unicorns</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">Theranos was publicly exposed in October 2015</a> by Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou, insiders knew that it was committing fraud many years earlier. For example, in 2006, Holmes gave a demo of an early prototype blood test to Novartis executives and faked the results when the device malfunctioned. When Theranos’ CFO confronted Holmes about the incident, she fired him. In 2008—roughly seven years before Carreyrou’s exposé—Theranos board members learned that Holmes had misled them about the company’s finances and the state of its technology.</p>
<p>Over time, a remarkable number of people, both inside and outside the company, began to suspect that Theranos was a fraud. An employee at Walgreens tasked with vetting Theranos for a potential partnership wrote in a report that the company was overselling its technology. Physicians in Arizona grew skeptical of the results their patients were receiving, and a pathologist in Missouri wrote a <a href="https://archive.is/BGtRJ">blog post</a> questioning Theranos’ claims about how accurate its devices were. Stanford Professor John Ioannidis published an <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2110977">article</a> in <i>JAMA </i>raising more doubts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rumors had spread in the VC community. Bill Maris of Google Ventures (since rebranded as GV) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-maris-explains-why-gv-didnt-invest-in-theranos-2015-10">claimed</a> that his fund passed on investing in Theranos in 2013. According to Maris, the firm had sent an employee to take a Theranos blood test at Walgreens. The employee was asked to give more than the single drop of blood that Theranos claimed its devices needed. After he refused a conventional venous blood draw, he was told to come back to give more blood.</p>
<p>So why did none of these doubts slow Theranos’ fundraising? Part of the answer is that it was a private company, and it’s nearly impossible to bet against private<i> </i>companies.</p>
<p>Until the last decade, most startups that grew to become valuable businesses chose to become public companies. Late-stage startups with reported valuations over $1 billion used to be so rare that VC Aileen Lee dubbed them “unicorns” in a 2013 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/">article</a> in TechCrunch. Back then, there were only 39 startups claiming billion-dollar valuations. By 2021, despite the surge in companies going public through SPACs, the number of unicorns had passed <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">800</a>.</p>
<p>The rise of unicorns has been accompanied by corporate misconduct scandals. Of course, public companies commit misconduct too. Research hasn’t yet established whether unicorns are systematically more prone to commit misconduct than comparable public companies. However, we do know that the opportunity to profit from information about a company by trading its securities creates incentives to uncover misconduct. Since the securities of private companies aren’t widely traded, it’s easier for private company executives to conceal misconduct.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Consider the electric truck company Nikola, formerly a unicorn. In 2020, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nikola-corp-vectoiq/nikola-corp-to-go-public-at-over-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN20Q1J5">Nikola went public through a SPAC</a>. Once it was public, short seller Nathan Anderson decided to investigate and ultimately issued a <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/">report</a> alleging a pattern of corporate misconduct. He showed that a video Nikola had produced with its prototype truck traveling at high speed was staged—Nikola had towed the truck to the top of a hill and filmed it rolling downhill in neutral. After Anderson released his report, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">the SEC and federal prosecutors launched investigations into whether the Nikola misled investors</a>. Its stock price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">lost more than half of its value</a>. In 2021, Nikola’s CEO Trevor Milton was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-141">charged</a> by the SEC and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-nikola-corporation-ceo-trevor-milton-charged-securities-fraud-scheme">indicted</a> by a federal grand jury. Nikola wouldn’t have been exposed so soon if it had stayed private.</p>
<p>Securities regulation restricts both the sale and resale of private company stock in the name of investor protection. Startups usually attach a contractual right of first refusal to their shares, which effectively requires employees to get the company’s permission to sell. Many late-stage startups practice “selective liquidity”: allowing key employees to cash out in private placements, while preventing a robust market from emerging. Consequently, those who have information about private company misconduct have little incentive to publicize it—even though the Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/82-276">held</a> that an investor who trades on information shared for the purpose of exposing fraud can’t be convicted of insider trading.</p>
<p>VCs might seem well-positioned to police unicorn misconduct. But their asymmetric risk preferences undermine their incentive to expose wrongdoing. VCs invest their funds in a portfolio of startups and expect that most bets will generate modest or negative returns, and only a <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/06/08/performance-data-and-the-babe-ruth-effect-in-venture-capital/">small number</a> will grow exponentially. The outsize growth of the few successful startups will offset the losses of the balance of the portfolio. For VCs, the difference between a startup that implodes in scandal and the many startups that fail to develop a product or find a market is insignificant.</p>
<p>Venture investing is an auction with a winner’s curse problem. Startups pitch to many VC firms in each fundraising round, but they only need to accept funding from one bidder. In public capital markets, if most investors decide that a company is fraudulent or excessively risky, its stock price will decline. In VC markets however, if most investors decide that a startup is fraudulent, the startup can still raise funds from a credulous contrarian. VCs who pass won’t share their negative assessment with the public because they want to maintain a founder-friendly reputation. Maris only told the press that GV had passed on Theranos <i>after </i>Carreyrou’s article.</p>
<p>Congress and the SEC could strengthen deterrence of unicorn misconduct by creating a market for trading private company securities, in three steps.</p>
<p>First, the regulations constraining the secondary trading of private company securities should be liberalized. The SEC should eliminate Rule 144’s holding period for resales as to accredited investors—the individual and institutional investors that the SEC deems sophisticated and most able to bear risk. Congress should eliminate section 12(g)’s requirement that effectively forces companies to go public if they acquire 2,000 record shareholders who are accredited investors—a rule that leads private companies to limit trading.</p>
<p>Second, the SEC should attach a regulatory most favored nation (MFN) clause to all securities sold through the safe harbors commonly used for private placements. An MFN clause would require that, if a company allows any of its securities to be resold, it must allow <i>all</i> its securities to be resold, as long as the resale is otherwise legal. A regulatory MFN clause would ban the practice of selective liquidity and nudge companies to allow their shares to be traded.</p>
<p>Third, the SEC should require that all private companies that let their securities be widely traded make limited public disclosures about their operations and finances. A limited disclosure mandate would protect investors by ensuring they had basic information about the companies in which they could invest, without saddling unicorns with the costly disclosure obligations placed on public companies.</p>
<p>The net effect of these reforms would be to create a robust market for trading unicorn stock among accredited investors. Most large, private companies would likely decide to allow their shares to be traded. Short sellers, analysts, and financial journalists would be attracted to the markets. Their investigations would strengthen deterrence of unicorn misconduct. The limited disclosure mandate, combined with the requirement that investors be accredited, would protect investors.</p>
<p>When large, private companies commit misconduct, the natural response is to increase the penalty for the underlying misconduct, not to interfere with the tradability of the company’s securities. But the problem isn’t lax penalties. Holmes is facing 20 years in prison—a punishment more brutal than anyone deserves. The problem is that penalties only work when wrongdoers expect to be caught. Trading creates incentives to expose misconduct faster.</p>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Margery Mayer served for 25 years as president of education at Scholastic. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Speech recognition technology is finally working for kids.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the case back in 1999, when my colleagues at Scholastic Education and I launched a reading intervention program called READ 180. We’d hoped to incorporate voice-enabled capabilities: Children would read to a computer program, which would provide real-time feedback on their fluency and literacy. Teachers, in turn, would receive information about their students’ progress.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our idea was 20 years ahead of the technology, and we moved ahead with READ 180 without speech-recognition capabilities. Even at the height of the dot-com bubble, speech recognition for classrooms was still largely the stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning hadn’t enabled us to map the terabytes of data required to block out ambient noise in busy classrooms. Nor had it evolved to grasp the complexity of children’s voices, which have different pitches and speech patterns than those of adults, much less recognize a variety of dialects and accents, and — last but not least — manage children’s less-than-predictable behaviors when engaging with technology.</p>
<p>At Scholastic, we didn’t want to tell kids they were mastering something when they weren’t, and we understood the profound implications of telling a young student they got something wrong when they were actually right.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Speech recognition has advanced to the point where it can recognize and process children’s speech and account for differences in accents or dialects. Companies like Dublin-based SoapBox Labs have developed speech-recognition technology that is modeled on the diversity of children’s voices you’d find in a busy playground or classroom. Thanks to the high accuracy and performance of this technology, elementary school educators can now rely on it to help them gauge students’ progress with more regularity and offer more personalized approaches to their instruction.</p>
<p>Such advances could not have come at a more crucial moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even before the pandemic, <a href="https://gradelevelreading.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/EarlyWarningConfirmed.pdf">more than 80%</a> of children from economically disadvantaged families failed to reach reading proficiency by fourth grade. After a year of separation from skilled educators, fumbling with technology designed for adults and vast gaps in digital equity, students had learned just 87% of the reading that they would have in a typical year, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-learning-loss-disparities-grow-and-students-need-help">report</a> from McKinsey &amp; Co. They lost an average of three months of learning during spring school closures.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, reading losses were especially acute in schools that serve mostly students of color, where reading scores were just 77% of the historical average.</p>
<p>As students return to classrooms, speech recognition can revolutionize education — not to mention remote learning and entertainment in the home — by transforming the way children interact with technology. Voice-enabled literacy, as well as math and language programs, can further professionalize the field by taking the administrative work out of measuring a child’s learning rate and acquisition of foundational skills.</p>
<p>For example, speech recognition can generate regular and valuable insights into a student’s reading progress, pick up on patterns or isolate areas where improvement is needed. Teachers can review the progress and assessment data generated by voice-enabled tools, adapt the learning paths for each child’s needs, screen for challenges such as dyslexia and schedule timely interventions when necessary.</p>
<p>Voice-enabled reading tools allow every child to spend time reading aloud and receiving feedback during the school day, something that simply isn’t practical for one teacher to offer. To put the challenge in perspective: 15 minutes of individual time per child in a class of 25 would eat up more than six hours of a teacher’s day, every day. That sort of individualized observation and assessment was a persistent challenge for teachers <em>before</em> COVID-19. It becomes even more challenging with the emergence of remote learning and as students return to school with unprecedented educational and emotional issues.</p>
<p>Speech recognition technology also has the potential to increase equity in the classroom. Human reading assessment is, after all, highly subjective, and recent studies have shown variances of up to 18% caused by assessor bias. The child-centered high-accuracy speech recognition available today overcomes inevitable human bias by ensuring that every child’s voice is understood regardless of accent or dialect.</p>
<p>In a few years, this technology will be part of every classroom instruction, accelerating the reading — and math and language — skills of young students. Educators will find it enables them to be more strategic in their instruction. And it holds tremendous promise for something desperately needed in the era of COVID-19: technology that can significantly improve reading outcomes and tackle the global literacy crisis in a real and profound way.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We interviewed MuteSix CRO Greg Gillman to discuss how the LA-based performance marketing agency bets on content and data to work with its direct-to-consumer e-commerce clients.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Warby Parker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">filing to IPO last week</a> was one more sign that direct-to-consumer (DTC) is an extremely powerful e-commerce trend. But LA-based performance marketing agency <a href="https://mutesix.com/">MuteSix</a> didn&#8217;t wait that long to build its business around scaling DTC brands.</p>
<p>Created in 2014 and acquired by Dentsu in 2019, <a href="https://mutesix.com/">MuteSix</a> was recommended to TechCrunch by Rhoda Ullmann, VP Consumer at Sense, a Boston-based startup building a home energy monitor. &#8220;They demonstrate best-in-class expertise with Facebook and Google paid ad platforms. They also have a very smart and efficient approach to creative development that was critical to helping us scale,&#8221; she wrote. (If you have growth marketing agencies or freelancers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out our survey</a>!)</p>
<p>Besides Sense, MuteSix&#8217;s former and current clients include companies such as Adidas, Petco, Ring and Theragun, to whom it provides a full range of marketing services, including top-notch direct response videos. But regardless of whether you can afford this, we think you&#8217;ll learn interesting lessons from our conversation with their CRO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greggillman/">Greg Gillman</a>. The key takeaway? In today&#8217;s highly competitive ad environment, both content and data are kings.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>What can you tell us about MuteSix as an agency?</b></p>

<p><b>Greg Gillman:</b> We&#8217;ve been around for about nine years. We started out as a Facebook ad agency — as opposed to a lot of agencies that start out by saying they do everything, we decided to focus on what we were really good at. At the time, it was doing Facebook media buying for e-commerce companies. Primarily here in LA, which is kind of the hub of these companies, but also all over. And then bit by bit, we grew the organization.</p>
<p>At this point, we&#8217;re a little over 400 people, and we manage upward of $500 million in spend on Facebook and Google, including Instagram and YouTube. What we&#8217;ve grown into is a one-stop shop for DTC e-commerce companies: We manage all the channels that a DTC brand needs. And we&#8217;re a performance agency; everything we do is based on results. People come to us to drive revenue into their e-commerce businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Why do you think that performance marketing is the right fit for DTC?</b></p>
<p>DTC entrepreneurs are more focused on immediate impact, because if they&#8217;re not selling product, there&#8217;s no large brand propping them up. So I think that doing DTC marketing requires you to be more performance focused. For agencies that work with large brands, usually it&#8217;s more about impression buying versus performance buying. They can say: I did a reach campaign today to hit 10 million eyeballs, and whatever happens happens, because at the end of the day, you just told us to do 10 million impressions. It&#8217;s different than working with a group like us that&#8217;s trying to optimize every small piece of the funnel, and being accountable for the entire funnel to drive as much sales or revenue.</p>
<p><b>What type of clients do you work with?</b></p>
<p>The majority of the companies we work with are digitally native DTC companies. We&#8217;ve mostly stayed in that lane, because we&#8217;re really good at it. That being said, we work with companies of all sizes — startups, companies that are already established, and very large companies that need to rework both their creative and their media buying strategy.</p>
<p>I oversee sales, marketing and partnerships, and my role is really trying to figure out which brands make most sense to partner with MuteSix. We&#8217;re looking for high-growth brands that we can scale, and we&#8217;ve learned through the years that what works well are demonstrable products that have cool user value props.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve worked with lots of startups at different points in the funnel, starting from the ground up and working with them through various rounds of funding, all the way through acquisitions, including two by unicorns. But these days, ground up is tougher. I like them to have some proof of concept — putting through $10,000-$15,000 per month on Facebook or $5,000-10,000 on Google usually shows me that there&#8217;s some life to it. But I don&#8217;t want to limit us if it&#8217;s a cool idea. I talk to a lot of people who come back once they&#8217;ve proven it out a little bit.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>What kind of clients are definitely not a good fit?</b></p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be a fit if there&#8217;s no real unique value prop for the product. If it&#8217;s just another run-of-the-mill company, a consultant can charge them a lower amount of money and set up Facebook ads, but what we are looking for are high-growth businesses.</p>
<p>The compensation for our campaign managers is actually tied to the performance of the campaigns, so if I bring a bunch of campaigns that we can&#8217;t scale, we&#8217;re gonna have a lot of unhappy media buyers who ask: &#8220;Greg, why would we take on this brand?&#8221; It&#8217;s a business model that has helped us attract top talent, but we need to make sure that we&#8217;re bringing brands that we think we can scale.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s easier than ever to start a company, but it&#8217;s tougher now to scale it and take it past the $2 million-$3 million run rate. So I always revert back to asking founders: What are five reasons why people want to buy your product? What are the five reasons that they don&#8217;t? If the entrepreneur has trouble answering this, it&#8217;s not going to work. If they can&#8217;t tell somebody why their business is good, then we&#8217;re not going to be good at selling it.</p>
<p><b>How is MuteSix different from other agencies?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the main difference is that we have a 70-person in-house video creative team; and what we&#8217;re really good at doing is shooting and coming up with performance content. Not just content that looks and feels great, but video that is reverse-engineered to sell product.</p>
<p>Another key component is that we have a whole data science team that is also integrated with our media buying team, and that helps companies navigate things like attribution and signal loss due to the iOS 14 update. Right now, that means focusing on looking at the whole picture rather than by channel and working on mix-modeling attribution.</p>
<p><b>What are some of the things your data team focuses on?</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest things that brands struggle with is figuring out attribution, and how you continue to spend money even though you may have lost some signal into the platform. If Facebook skews too heavily, and Google is on last click, then sometimes it looks like things are never working. To help companies make informed business decisions, we are building statistical models that show information at higher-than-the-platform level.</p>
<p>We are also building better segments of customer profiles that help the clients understand who their core audience is, but also helps us build predictive audiences for finding new people.</p>
<p>Another big thing we&#8217;re trying to solve is incrementality. We work with large brands that have a strong organic following on social media; and their question is: &#8220;Hey, Greg, why should I spend more money if I would have acquired those users anyway?&#8221; So we&#8217;ve done incrementality testing with brands that spend a lot in other channels than Facebook and Google. We helped them build out different ways to look at the data so that we continue to spend in those channels and they actually know the incremental lift that they&#8217;re getting<i>.</i></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one other piece that I think is super important and usually overlooked: first-party data. We work with brands to try and acquire as much of that first-party data as possible, segment it and use it, because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;d be left with if Facebook shut off tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>How do you prepare and adapt for changes in the marketing ecosystem?</b></p>
<p>Because we work with so many brands, we have a lot of senior leadership on each channel level. We routinely meet across departments and share insights. The data science team also builds pretty robust reporting. We try to stay ahead of our brands and to be forward-thinking about anything that is ultimately going to impact the agency. We&#8217;re constantly trying to hack our way through things like the types of content that work and things that we know will help us scale.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how we have always approached it. Every major shift in our business was done to answer the needs of the brands that we were working with. For instance, there&#8217;s a data side to our business because it&#8217;s more important than ever to use that. Facebook used to be a platform where you could throw anything at the wall, and you would get a 4x or 5x return. No one&#8217;s asking about data when you&#8217;re literally printing money out of Facebook, right? It only happens when the margins get tight. But then Facebook became a more crowded platform, and the same happened with Google: more advertisers, higher CPM and a more competitive environment. We needed to be smarter about what we were doing, so we built out our data team.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s two levers that we can pull: the data side and the creative side of the business. Again, we are a performance marketing agency, focusing on all the levers. Because platforms like Facebook are only going to be more competitive, they&#8217;re only going to get more expensive, and we are only going to lose more traffic. So the more agile agencies have to think much farther outside of what we are doing on these platforms; because we&#8217;re going to make up the incremental revenue on things like SMS, influencer marketing and organic content, to continue to drive money into the top of the funnel.</p>
<p><b>Why is your content arm so important as a lever?</b></p>
<p>We have an integrated solution where our media buyers are paired directly with our video editors and producers to allow us to be agile and quick; because as everyone knows, content is king. What we try to do is optimize around things like what we call the thumbs-up rate on Facebook — three-second video views. If I held someone for that long in their newsfeed, I can potentially get them into our flow. We do the same on YouTube, and we do things like this on programmatic, because the name of the game is to get people into the funnel and work them through it. And we&#8217;re using both our data science team and our creative team to build out and optimize on the front end around these quick metrics to get things moving.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there&#8217;s no close second to an SMB agency that has a content arm like we do. Leveraging our content team to build performance content is one of the biggest levers that we have. Three and a half years ago, Facebook was telling us: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t build video content, and if you don&#8217;t prioritize video in the newsfeed, it&#8217;s not going to work.&#8221; At the time, we leaned in very hard — and the pain of growing a creative team of 70 people is real, especially in LA. But it&#8217;s allowed us to scale our agency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following <a href="https://accomplice.ai">last year&#8217;s price hike</a> on its Live TV service, Hulu is now preparing to raise prices again. Starting on October 8, 2021, Hulu will raise the price for both its on-demand plans, Hulu and Hulu with No Ads. However, unlike the earlier price hike which had clocked in at $10 more per month for each of its two Live TV plans, the new price increase will be just $1.00.</p>
<p>That means the ad-supported version of Hulu will increase from $5.99 to $6.99 per month, while Hulu with No Ads will increase from $11.99 to $12.99 per month. This will apply to both existing and new subscribers. Hulu says none of the October increases will impact its Live TV service or any plan where Hulu is <a href="https://www.hulu.com/hulu-disney-espn-bundle-offer">bundled</a> with Disney+. (Disney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/media/disney-hulu-comcast.html">took full control</a> of Hulu after buying Comcast&#8217;s stake in 2019).</p>
<p>Today, Hulu is offered with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $13.99 per month. This subtle shift in pricing for Hulu&#8217;s standalone service may make that bundle look attractive to those not in the market for Hulu&#8217;s live TV.</p>
<p>Hulu&#8217;s on-demand service accounts for the majority of its subscriber base today. In Disney&#8217;s fiscal third quarter earnings, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/disney-beats-expectations-to-reach-116-million-subscribers-in-q3/">announced</a> last month, Hulu&#8217;s subscription video on-demand business had grown 22% year-over-year to reach 39.1 million subscribers, while its Live TV service (which also include the on-demand offerings), had grown just 9% to reach 3.7 million subscribers. Combined, Hulu had 42.8 million total subscribers, up 21% compared to the same period from the prior year.</p>
<p>This is slower growth, however, than Disney+ &#8212; that service saw more than 100% year-over-year growth, jumping from 57.7 million subscribers as of Disney&#8217;s Q3 2020 to 116 million in Disney&#8217;s Q3 2021.</p>
<p>Including Disney&#8217;s EPSN+, the company&#8217;s direct-to-consumer business had a total of nearly 174 million subscribers by the end of the quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>However, although Hulu trails Disney+ in subscriber count, it&#8217;s ahead on average monthly revenue per user (ARPU).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Q3, ARPU declined from $4.62 to $4.16 due to a higher mix of Disney+ Hotstar subscribers compared with the prior-year quarter, Disney said. Hulu&#8217;s on-demand service, meanwhile, saw ARPU climb from $11.39 to $13.15 year-over-year and its Live TV service (+SVOD) grew from $68.11 to $84.09.</p>
<p>Hulu&#8217;s on-demand business includes a combination of licensed content and original programming, like newer arrivals &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers,&#8221; &#8220;Only Murders in the Building,&#8221; and &#8220;Vacation Friends.&#8221; The company also just added thousands of <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/08/31/vivo-indian-premier-league-icc-mens-t20-world-cup-and-bcci-cricket-coming-soon-to-espn-hotstar-specials-available-on-hulu-beginning-sept-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/08/31/vivo-indian-premier-league-icc-mens-t20-world-cup-and-bcci-cricket-coming-soon-to-espn-hotstar-specials-available-on-hulu-beginning-sept-1/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631026013131000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvo1Zg1PN2mykbCaF6DA3KU6E3EA">Hotstar Specials and Bollywood hits,</a> as of September 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Invites just went for Apple’s next big event, scheduled for <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET on September 14</strong>. The invite doesn&#8217;t offer a lot in the way of what&#8217;s to come &#8212; it&#8217;s a neon logo set against a lovely sierras backdrop and an apparent The Mamas &amp; the Papas reference in the form of &#8220;California Streaming.&#8221; Beats CaliforniPhoneication, I suppose. As the name implies, the event will &#8212; once again &#8212; be all virtual, no doubt owing to various variants.</p>
<p>The company’s reportedly got a lot of hardware waiting in the wings ahead of the holidays, but the timing in certainly right on this one for the iPhone 13. Last year marked a rare delay for the company, owing to larger issues with the supply chain that hamstrung most of the industry.</p>
<p>Per usual, there’s been a lot of speculation around the upcoming handset’s release. Last year’s long-awaited arrival of 5G marked a big windfall for the company, as the overall industry was flagging. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/iphone-sales-fuel-apples-wall-street-beating-q3/">a massive few quarters for the iPhone</a>, as those holding off on upcoming finally pulled the trigger.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re California Streaming on September 14th. See you real soon. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3de.png" alt="🏞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AppleEvent</a> <a href="https://t.co/OjOvJFXlHd">pic.twitter.com/OjOvJFXlHd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So, what surprises does Apple have up its sleeve for the next version of the handset? Recent leaks point to a feature called Emergency Message via Satellite, which offers short satellite calls for phones temporarily unable to access their cellular networks. Honestly, though, the information around this is currently murky, at best.</p>
<p>Other expected updates include a 120Hz display – many expected the update to arrive on iPhone 12, but all versions of the handset still sported a 60Hz refresh rate. It’s expected to pack the new A15 chip, improved sensors and a larger battery. And for good measure, a new MagSafe charger also<a href="https://twitter.com/davezatz/status/1434920116551131147"> just made its way through the FCC.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Apple Watch 7 and AirPods 3 are also set for release sooner, than later. Though Apple certainly hasn’t been above splitting things up a bit in the virtual event era.</p>
<p>As ever, we&#8217;ll be there (virtually) to bring it to you, live.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Vowel's meeting operating system has the goal of making meetings more useful before, during and after.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings are an inevitable part of the work day, but as workplaces became more distributed over the past 18 months, <a href="https://www.vowel.com/">Vowel</a> CEO Andy Berman says we are steadily moving toward “death by meeting.”</p>
<p>His virtual meeting platform is the latest to receive venture capital funding — $13.5 million — with the goal of making meetings more useful before, during and after.</p>
<p>Vowel is launching a meeting operating system with tools like real-time transcription; integrated agendas, notes and action items; meeting analytics; and searchable, on-demand recordings of meetings. The company has a freemium business model and will also be rolling out a business plan this fall for $16 per user per month. Extra features will include advanced integrations, security and admin controls.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Otter.ai&#8217;s newest feature offers live, interactive transcripts of your Zoom meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/embed/#?secret=iy6YfVkUKA" data-secret="iy6YfVkUKA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Series A was led by David Hornik of Lobby Capital, who was joined by existing investors Amity Ventures and Box Group and a group of individual investors, including Calendly CEO Tope Awotona, Intercom co-founder Des Traynor, Slack VP Ethan Eismann, former Yammer executive Viviana Faga, former InVision president David Fraga and Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Vowel, Berman was one of the founders of baby monitor company Nanit. The company had teams spread out around the world, and communication was tough as a result. In 2018, the company went looking for a tool that would work for synchronous and asynchronous meetings, but there were still a lot of time zones to manage, he said.</p>
<p>Taking a cue from Nanit’s own baby monitors that were streaming video over 17 hours a day, the idea for Vowel was born, and the company began to focus on the hypothesis that distributed work would be prevalent.</p>
<p>“People initially thought we were crazy, but then the pandemic hit, and everyone was learning how to work remotely,” Berman told TechCrunch. “As we now go back to hybrid work, we see this as an opportunity.”</p>
<p>In 2017, Harvard Business Review reported that <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness">executives spent 23 hours in meetings each week</a>. Berman now estimates that the average worker spends half of their time each week in meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vowel is out to bring Slack, Figma and GitHub components to meetings by recording audio and video that can be paused at any time. Users can add notes and see where those notes fall within a real-time transcription that enables people who arrive late or could not make the meeting to catch up easily. After meetings are over, they can be shared, and Vowel has a search function so that users can go back and see where a particular person or topic was discussed.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow its team in product, design and engineering. Vowel plans to hire up to 30 new people over the next year. The company recently closed its beta test and has amassed a 10,000-person waitlist. The public launch will happen in the fall, Berman said.</p>
<p>Workplace productivity and office communication tools are not new concepts, but as Berman explained, became increasingly important when homes became offices over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>Competitors took different approaches to solving these problems: focusing on video conferencing or audio or meeting management with plugins. Berman says an area where many have not succeeded yet is integrating meetings into the typical workflow. That’s where Vowel comes in with its “meeting OS,” he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SvfkoCnSwk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/">3 views on the future of meetings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 views on the future of meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/embed/#?secret=SvfkoCnSwk" data-secret="SvfkoCnSwk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Our goal is to make meetings more inclusive and worthwhile, which includes the prep, the meeting and the follow-up,” Berman said. “We see the future will be about knowledge management, so the difference between what we are doing is ensuring you can catch up quickly and keep that knowledge base. A Garner report said that <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/75-of-work-conversations-could-be-recorded-and-assessed-by-2025-according-to-gartner/">75% of workplace meetings will be recorded by 2025</a>, and that is a trend we are reinventing from the ground up.”</p>
<p>David Hornick, founding partner at Lobby Capital, said he became acquainted with Vowel from its existing investor Amity Ventures. Hornick, who sits on the GitLab board, said GitLab was one of the largest distributed companies in the tech space, prior to the pandemic, and saw first-hand the challenge of making distributed teams functionable.</p>
<p>When Hornick heard about Vowel, he said he “jumped quickly” on the opportunity. His firm typically invests in platform businesses that have the capacity to transform business spaces. Many are pure software, like Splunk or GitLab, while others are akin to Bill.com, which transformed how small businesses manage financial operations, he added.</p>
<p>All of those combine into a company, like Vowel, especially given the company’s vision for a meeting OS to transform a meeting space that hadn’t moved forward in decades, he said.</p>
<p>“This was quickly obvious to me because my day is meetings — an eight-Zoom day is a normal day — I just wish I could remember everything,” Hornick said. “Speaking with early customers using the product, when I asked them what they would do if this ever went away, the first thing they said was ‘cry,’ and, because there was no alternative, would return to Zoom or other tools, but it would be a big setback.”</p>

<p>Initially, much of the livestream economy was based on one-off purchases like sticker packs, but today, consumers are gifting content creators directly during their live streams. Some of these donations can be incredibly high, at times. Twitch streamer ExoticChaotic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qk70a0zeic&amp;t=1s">was gifted</a> $75,000 during a live session on Fortnite, which was one of the largest ever donations on the game streaming social network. Meanwhile, App Annie notes another platform, Bigo Live, is enabling broadcasters to <a href="https://nyweekly.com/entertainment/beau-gevonne-strawder-moves-out-of-his-mothers-house-to-achieve-success-in-hollywood/">earn</a> up to $24,000 per month through their live streams.</p>
<p>Apps that offer live streaming as a prominent feature are also those that are driving the majority of today&#8217;s social app spending, the report says. In the first half of this year, $3 out every $4 spend in the top 25 social apps came from apps that offered live streams, for example.</p>

<p>During the first half of 2021, the U.S. become the top market for consumer spending inside social apps with 1.7x the spend of the next largest market, Japan, and representing 30% of the market by spend. China, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea followed to round out the top 5.</p>

<p>While both creators and the platforms are financially benefitting from the live streaming economy, the platforms are benefitting in other ways beyond their commissions on in-app purchases. Live streams are helping to drive demand for these social apps and they help to boost other key engagement metrics, like time spent in app.</p>
<p>One top app that&#8217;s significantly gaining here is TikTok.</p>
<p>Last year, TikTok surpassed YouTube in the U.S. and the U.K. in terms of the average monthly time spent per user. It often continues to lead in the former market, and more decisively leads in the latter.</p>

<p>In other markets, like South Korea and Japan, TikTok is making strides, but YouTube still leads by a wide margin. (In South Korea, YouTube leads by 2.5x, in fact.)</p>

<p>Beyond just TikTok, consumers spent 740 billion hours in social apps in the first half of the year, which is equal to 44% of the time spent on mobile globally. Time spent in these apps has continued to trend upwards over the years, with growth that&#8217;s up 30% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>Today, the apps that enable live streaming are outpacing those that focus on chat, photo or video. This is why companies like Instagram are now announcing dramatic shifts in focus, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus">how they&#8217;re &#8220;no longer a photo sharing app.</a>&#8221; They know they need to more fully shift to video or they will be left behind.</p>
<p>The total time spent in the top five social apps that have an emphasis on live streaming are now set to surpass half a trillion hours on Android phones alone this year, not including China. That&#8217;s a three-year CAGR of 25% versus just 15% for apps in the Chat and Photo &amp; Video categories, App Annie noted.</p>

<p>Thanks to growth in India, the Asia-Pacific region now accounts for 60% of the time spent in social apps. As India&#8217;s growth in this area increased over the past 3.5 years, it shrunk the gap between itself and China from 115% in 2018 to just 7% in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Social app downloads are also continuing to grow, due to the growth in live streaming.</p>
<p>To date, consumers have downloaded social apps 74 billion times and that demand remains strong, with 4.7 billion downloads in the first half of 2021 alone &#8212; up 50% year-over-year. In the first half of the year, Asia was the largest region region for social app downloads, accounting for 60% of the market.</p>
<p>This is largely due to India, the top market by a factor of 5x, which surpassed the U.S. back in 2018. India is followed by the U.S., Indonesia, Brazil and China, in terms of downloads.</p>

<p>The shift towards live streaming and video has also impacted what sort of apps consumers are interested in downloading, not just the number of downloads.</p>
<p>A chart that show the top global apps from 2012 to the present highlights Facebook&#8217;s slipping grip. While its apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook) have dominated the top spots over the years in various positions, TikTok popped into the number one position last year, and continues to maintain that ranking in 2021.</p>
<p>Further down the chart, other apps that aid in video editing have also overtaken others that had been more focused on photos or chat.</p>

<p>Video apps like YouTube (#1), TikTok (#2) Tencent Video (#4), Bigo Live (#5), Twitch (#6), and others also now rank at the top of the global charts by consumer spending in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>But YouTube (#1) still dominates in time spent compared with TikTok (#5), and others from Facebook &#8212; the company holds the next three spots for Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, respectively.</p>
<p>This could explain why TikTok is now exploring the idea of allowing users to upload even longer videos, by increasing the limit from 3 minutes to 5, for instance.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TikTok is testing a longer 5 minute video upload limit <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f57a.png" alt="🕺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f933-1f3fb.png" alt="🤳🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/qiRbJmHkma">pic.twitter.com/qiRbJmHkma</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In addition, because of live streaming&#8217;s ability to drive growth in terms of time spent, it&#8217;s also likely the reason why TikTok has been heavily investing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tiktok-expands-live-platform-with-new-features-for-creators-and-fans/">new features for its TikTok LIVE platform</a>, including things like events, support for co-hosts, Q&amp;As and more, and why it made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tiktok-expands-live-platform-with-new-features-for-creators-and-fans/">the &#8220;LIVE&#8221; button</a> a more prominent feature in its app and user experience.</p>
<p>App Annie&#8217;s report also digs into the impact live streaming has had on specific platforms, like Twitch and Bigo Live, the former which doubled its monthly active user base from the pre-pandemic era, and the latter which saw $314.2 million in consumer spend during H1 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability of social media users to communicate with each other using live video – or watch others&#8217; live broadcasts – has not only maintained the growth of a social media app market, but contributed to its exponential growth in engagement metrics like time spent, that might otherwise have saturated some time ago,&#8221; wrote App Annie&#8217;s Head of Insights, Lexi Sydow, <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/evolution-of-social-media-report/">when announcing</a> the new report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Washington D.C’s Howard University has canceled classes after becoming the latest educational institution to be hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack.</p>
<p>The incident was discovered on September 3, just weeks after students returned to campus, when the University&#8217;s Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) detected “unusual activity” on the University&#8217;s network and intentionally shut it down in order to investigate.</p>
<p>“Based on the investigation and the information we have to date, we know the University has experienced a ransomware cyberattack,&#8221; the university <a href="https://newsroom.howard.edu/newsroom/article/14946/ransomware-cyberattack-update">said in a statement</a>. While some details remain unclear — it’s unknown who is behind the attack or how much of a ransom was demanded — Howard University said that there is no evidence so far to suggest that personal data of its 9,500 undergraduate and graduate students been accessed or exfiltrated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“However, our investigation remains ongoing, and we continue to work toward clarifying the facts surrounding what happened and what information has been accessed,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In order to enable its IT team to fully assess the impact of the ransomware attack, Howard University has canceled Tuesday’s classes, opening its campus to essential employees only. Campus Wi-Fi will also be down while the investigation is underway, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-computing/">cloud-based software</a> will remain available to students and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“This is a highly dynamic situation, and it is our priority to protect all sensitive personal, research and clinical data,” the university said. “We are in contact with the FBI and the D.C. city government, and we are installing additional safety measures to further protect the University’s and your personal data from any criminal ciphering.”</p>
<p>But the university warned that that remediation will be &#8220;a long haul — not an overnight solution.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Howard University is the latest in a long line of educational institutions to be hit by ransomware since the start of the pandemic, with the FBI’s Cyber Division recently warning that cybercriminals using this type of attack are focusing heavily on schools and universities due to the widespread shift to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-learning/">remote learning</a>. Last year, the University of California paid $1.14 million to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">NetWalker</a> hackers after they encrypted data within its School of Medicine’s servers, and the University of Utah paid hackers $457,000 to prevent them from releasing data stolen during an attack on its network. </span></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1420430442071691265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow last month,</a> ransomware attacks have disrupted 58 U.S. education organizations and school districts, including 830 individual schools, so far in 2021. Emsisoft estimates that in 2020, 84 incidents disrupted learning at 1,681 individual schools, colleges, and universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll likely see a significant increase in ed sector incidents in the coming weeks,&#8221; Callow <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1435258570186973193">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye and rental car giant Sixt SE plan to launch a robotaxi service in Munich next year, the CEOs of the two companies announced Tuesday during the IAA Mobility show in Germany.</p>
<p>The robotaxi service is leveraging all of Intel&#8217;s, and more specifically Mobileye&#8217;s, assets that have been in development or purchased in recent years, including the $900 million acquisition in 2020 of Moovit, an Israeli startup that analyzes urban traffic patterns and provides transportation recommendations with a focus on public transit.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, riders will be able to access the robotaxi service via the Moovit app. The service will also be offered through Sixt&#8217;s mobility ONE app, which gives customers the ability hail a ride, rent, share or subscribe to vehicles.</p>
<p>This will not be a large-scale commercial service in the beginning. The Mobileye robotaxis are expected to begin with an early-rider test program on Munich streets in 2022. If that mimics other early rider programs, the service will likely invite and then approve small groups of riders and then scale from there. The fleet will then move from test to commercial operations upon regulatory approval, the companies said.</p>
<p>Intel and Mobileye plan to scale the service across Germany and into other European countries later this decade. The companies chose Germany, a country where Mobileye is already testing its autonomous vehicle technology, because of a recently enacted law that permits driverless vehicles on public roads,.</p>
<p>&#8220;Germany has shown global leadership toward a future of autonomous mobility by expediting crucial AV legislation,&#8221; Intel CEO Gelsinger said Tuesday at IAA.  “Our ability to begin robotaxi operations in Munich next year would not be possible without this new law.”</p>
<p>During the IAA keynote, Mobileye also unveiled the vehicles branded with MoovitAV and SIXT. These vehicles, which are equipped with Mobileye&#8217;s self-driving system, will be produced in volume and used for the robotaxi service in Germany, the companies said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Mobileye is perhaps best known for supplying automakers with computer vision technology that powers advanced driver assistance systems — a business that generated nearly $967 million in sales last year — the company has also been developing automated vehicle technology.</p>
<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobileye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute, redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. Mobileye has agreements with six OEMs, including BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip, which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators.</p>
<p>The strategy, Mobileye President and CEO Amnon Shashua has told TechCrunch in the past, will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://meethoneybee.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aims to help companies provide access to financial support to their employees, announced today it has raised $5.7 million in equity in a round led by FFVC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolute Ventures, Afore Capital, Rebalance Capital, K50 and Financial Venture Studio also participated in the financing, along with two-time NBA all-star Baron Davis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBee has also secured a $100 million debt facility from CIM, an institutional impact investment manager that provides debt capital for innovation that lends to underserved communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles-based <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps#:~:text=Certified%20B%20Corporations%20are%20businesses%20that%20meet%20the,and%20build%20a%20more%20inclusive%20and%20sustainable%20economy.">Certified B Corp</a> describes itself as a B2B financial technology company that is on a mission to give employees &#8212; and their families &#8212; free access to financial support in the workplace as a benefit. That support could come in the form of employer-sponsored “no-cost rainy day funds” and on-demand financial therapy with the goal of “creating a healthier workforce environment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or put even more simply, HoneyBee aims to give HR and DEI leaders that say they are committed to creating an equitable and inclusive culture a way to provide access to financial tools and education to help improve their employees’ financial health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and co-founder Ennie Lim said she was inspired to start HoneyBee after suffering financial setbacks after her own divorce several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My credit was negatively impacted to the point where I found myself unable to get access to any affordable credit,” she recalls. “I wish I had done a lot of things differently, but I didn’t know what I didn’t know, and I was embarrassed to ask for help.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience helped Lim realize the importance of feeling in control of your financial life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It affects your self-esteem, happiness and personal relationships and it made me want to help others take control of theirs,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lim teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benny Yiu and Max Zschoch in 2017 to build HoneyBee with that goal in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are solving a massive economic disparity and we&#8217;re leveling the playing field in the workplace by reducing the financial literacy gap and providing access to credit to people that need it most,” Lim said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to acknowledge that people come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The varying levels of financial illiteracy is an issue we can no longer ignore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198137" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198137" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2198137 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?w=266" alt="" width="283" height="319" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=768,867 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=602,680 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=1360,1536 1360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198137" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HoneyBee</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study conducted by Washington University in St. Louis found that 89% of HoneyBee users are people of color, women, or both. During the pandemic, when the need for its offering was even greater, HoneyBee signed over 60 mid-markets companies as customers and is launching with Fortune 500 companies later this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup&#8217;s user growth grew by 225% during the pandemic and the company says it delivered over $2 million in rainy day funds. Meanwhile, its on-demand financial therapy usage increased by 172% over the prior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amidst this pandemic, when employers were cutting budgets, furloughing, laying off, reducing hours and salaries, we started to see a shift in their buying behavior to address financial health,” Lim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honeybee’s customers include Alameda County Community Food Bank, DC Central Kitchen, Kate Somerville, Community Catalyst of California, Southwest Water Company, Straus Family Creamery, Asian Art Museum, Pasadena Humane Society and Peachtree Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA star Baron Davis grew up in South Central Los Angeles with his grandmother and says he believes strongly in the startup’s desire to provide access to affordable credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial literacy is a barbed wire for people like me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential for companies to provide equitable access to financial support for their employees,” he wrote via email. “Financial access alleviates stress in the workplace especially when they are working hard to make ends meet to support their family. Providing easy access to money and education will result in a happier, healthier, productive workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FFVC Partner AJ Plotkin said his firm likes that the structure of the product “solves a serious access problem for customers who need a bridge for short-term, emergency needs, in a way that is not burdensome for the employee or the employer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part to grow its sales, engineering, and customer success team. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.jetty.com">Jetty,</a> a fintech company which aims to give renters flexibility when paying rent, has raised $23 million in a funding round co-led by Citi and Flourish Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings Jetty’s total raised since its 2016 inception to $78 million. Other investors participating in the latest growth round include Credit Ease and K5. Previous backers include Farmers Insurance Group, Khosla and Ribbit Capital, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-person New York City-based startup has come up with a way to help renters make rent on time with an offering that resembles the &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; (BNPL) model that is increasingly used by consumers at the point of sale, online and in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, renters can pay their rent when it’s due and then have up until the 24th of the month to pay the money back to Jetty &#8212; either in a lump sum or via installments. They don’t pay interest charges or late fees, but rather a monthly subscription fee ranging from $15 to $25, depending on the renter&#8217;s risk profile. If the renter fails to pay back the money during the agreed upon time, they will not be able to borrow more for the following month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monthly fee is “far lower” than any potential late fee if the rent is not paid on time, said co-founder and CEO Mike Rudoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Around 50% of the average renter&#8217;s paycheck is going to rent. So this is the largest expense of any renter, on a given month,” he said. “And so you would expect that there would be some type of financial services product that would give them the flexibility that they need to come up with the money on time in such a way that they weren&#8217;t penalized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offering is more of a cousin to traditional BNPL, he said, than actual BNPL.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will pay the rent on behalf of the renter in full on the first of the month, giving property managers the money they need when they need it,” Rudoy explained. “Renters get 24 days to pay it back on a schedule that suits their needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To launch Jetty Rent, the company partnered with Cortland, a large real estate investment, development and management company, to roll out the offering in beta to residents across a portfolio of properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the startup is launching the offering to the public. Jetty Rent is the newest product on the startup’s platform, which also offers “low cost” renters insurance as well as security deposit replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mission of the company is to make renting more affordable and flexible,” Rudoy said. “And we are a financial services platform whereby every product that we have launched is meant to both provide value to both property managers as well as renters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the move, Jetty is evolving from being an insurtech to also a lender, said Rudoy. The company is providing the loans through Cross River Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working to bring some additional credit and lending prowess to the business given the fact it has historically been considered an insurtech company,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the company offers all three products to property managers gives it a competitive edge, according to Rudoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This makes us different from other financial services companies attacking the same space and problem set,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re the only one that has both a security deposit alternative and flexible rent product under the same roof. It makes the choice to work with us much easier if you’re a property manager, from an integration and onboarding perspective. It means fewer different brands in front of renters as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renters pay for all the products and the property managers are partners in the distribution of the products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the company has agreements with property owners and managers that operate more than 2.2 million rental units across the country. Since starting to build its property partner network in 2017, Jetty has seen 193% average year over year growth in contracted units, according to Alex Vlasto, the company&#8217;s VP of marketing. Besides Cortland, it also works with AMLI Residential, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmalyn Shaw, managing partner of Flourish Ventures, notes that over 70% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stable housing is a critical component in helping them achieve financial security,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jetty, Shaw added, is the only company “that extends beyond a single solution to embed a rich and differentiated set of financial offerings,” including rental insurance, security deposit alternatives and now rent flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through its unique consumer insights, differentiated pricing, increased consumer loyalty, Jetty has achieved a significant competitive advantage,” she wrote via email. “Moreover, their consumer reach through top property management entities like Cortland is unparalleled.”</span></p>
<p>As of late, other startups that have come up with new technology to make the lives of renters easier have also raised money. <a href="https://www.sugarliving.com/">Sugar</a>, a startup that aims to turn apartment buildings into “interactive communities,” recently closed on $2.5 million in seed funding.  And, <a href="https://www.getrentcheck.com/">RentCheck</a>, a startup that has built out an automated property inspection platform, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/rentcheck-raises-millions/">raised $2.6 million in seed money</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulate Inc., a biotech company focused on developing “organ-on-a-chip” technology, closed an $82 million Series E round on Tuesday. This latest round is intended to formulate a massive investment in a “roadmap” for developing model organ systems created to fit drug makers&#8217; needs and bring the idea of an organ-on-a-chip into use in the lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An organ-on-a-chip is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: It’s a recreation of a human organ (or system of human organs) scaled down into a tiny piece of hardware about the size of a AA battery. That hardware, the so-called “chip,” contains chambers where human cells (like brain cells, the kidney, lung, brain intestine, etc.), can be grown. Then the chip can be manipulated to simulate breathing, blood flow through an organ or other mechanical forces that might happen in a human body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the chip is supposed to mimic the conditions within a human body, and allow drug makers to better predict what might happen when a new candidate is introduced. It’s a new model for experiments that could prove critical in the pre-clinical study process. Right now that area of research is dominated by traditional cell- or animal-based models &#8212; though Emulate, and other similar companies are hoping to change that paradigm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulate was founded in 2013 and has, so far, raised about $255 million in funding. This most recent Series E round, led by Northpond Ventures and Perceptive Advisors, is part of Emulate’s plan to invest more heavily in R&amp;D, and create specific organ-on-a-chip applications that they’ve homed in on through conversations with drug companies. So far, Emulate counts 21 major drug companies, including Roche, Genentech, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gilead Sciences, as customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We researched what pharma is spending their R&amp;D dollars on &#8212; particular types of molecules, biologics and so-forth &#8212; then we created a roadmap, a series of applications aligned to where big pharma is spending their money,” Jim </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO of Emulate tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Emulate announced several new products and services that are part of this roadmap. They include the Emulate brain chip, designed to aid with research into central nervous system disorders (like Alzheimer&#8217;s), an immune cell recruitment application that will investigate how the immune system interacts across the lungs, liver and intestine (using lung-chips, liver-chips, and intestine chips), and a microbiome model integrated into the liver chip. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett says the company will look to roll out 14 applications over the next two years, seven of which will roll out next year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organs on chips have been around for about a decade. The NIH has </span><a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/projects/space"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched them into space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to study the effects of spaceflight, and has been developing tissue chip testing and validation programs </span><a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2010</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/7/3/112/htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioengineering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes the organ-on-a-chip industry was recently valued around $21 million, but could grow to about $220 million by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of that growth will depend on the potential for an organ-on-a-chip to disrupt the preclinical side of the drug testing process. And that itself depends a lot on how the FDA views data collected on that platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific organ-on-a-chip technology itself doesn’t need to be FDA approved (it’s not a  therapeutic or device), but drug companies will almost certainly seek assurance that the agency is receptive to experiments using organs-on-chips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Corbett’s perspective, he says the FDA has proved “very receptive” to data collected on these platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence the company has worked closely with the FDA in the past. </span><a href="https://emulatebio.com/press/fda-organ-chip-crada-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, Emulate entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the FDA. A CRADA agreement allows a non-federal collaborator to provide funding and equipment for a research project conducted at an FDA laboratory. The FDA provides no funding, but does allow for the collaborator to license intellectual property developed during such projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this program, Emulate’s lung chips were used in COVID-19 research. The brain chip, liver and intestine chips were also used for individual research projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA collaboration aside, there’s also been regulatory movement that could favor companies pursuing organ chips. For instance, the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2565/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+1%22%5D%7D&amp;r=33&amp;s=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA Modernization Act of 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced in Congress in April, would allow the FDA to use “alternative testing methods to animal testing” to evaluate safety and efficacy of drugs. The bill specifically includes organs on chips in its definition of a non-clinical test or study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the Modernization Act goes through, it&#8217;s clearly spelled out,” says Corbett. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the field of organ-on-a-chip research is relatively new. Whether or not it will eventually help more drug candidates materialize is still theory. Though, with a new round of funding and a changing regulatory environment, we could have solid answers sooner rather than later. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Managers are occasionally evaluated by their team&#8217;s occupational wellness — the sometimes-hazy calculation that rates employees’ professional and personal contentment. What may not be as commonly tested is the connected concept of <a href="https://blog.smarp.com/employee-engagement-8-statistics-you-need-to-know">employee engagement</a>, which measures how committed employees are to helping their company succeed. While 71% of executives <a href="https://fasttrack.com.au/blog/employee-engagement-leads-to-greater-productivity/">cite employee engagement as essential</a> to their success, a mere 15% of U.S. employees <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx">consider</a> themselves engaged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for employers, when we look through either the contentment or engagement lens, we see a workforce in crisis — <a href="https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/Mind%20the%20Workplace%20-%20MHA%20Workplace%20Health%20Survey%202017%20FINAL.PDF">upward of 70% of U.S. workers</a> are so unhappy in their roles that they are thinking about and/or actively looking for a new job.</p>
<p>What’s behind all this? Developmental stagnation at work and the opportunity for a better role elsewhere, often defined not merely as one with more pay, but as one presenting a pathway toward <a href="https://turningpointexecsearch.com/blog/employers/good-employees-quit/">personal and professional growth</a> and upward mobility.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Rather than list out the litany of errors, let’s gauge your company’s employee development and engagement efforts.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pandemic has only exacerbated the dissatisfaction of many employees — at varied levels — who feel stuck in unfulfilling jobs, with little guidance on how to advance or pivot in their careers and achieve the dignity of meaningful, impactful work.</p>
<p>This piece aims to deliver a simple action plan for assessing your employees’ engagement level and taking targeted steps to build the kind of committed and reliable workforce necessary to survive and thrive in today’s marketplace.</p>
<h2>Common failures in corporate career development efforts</h2>
<p>While researching employee retention when building our startup, we identified a number of common and recurring shortcomings in career-development practices — ones that are likely to be familiar to most Fortune 500 companies, as well as scaling, high-growth startups.</p>
<p>We focused on the <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/">activities</a> and <a href="https://worldmanagementsurvey.org/">strategies</a> companies use to align their skills needs with workers&#8217; capabilities and aspirations — specifically, their approach to advancing staff toward jobs deemed both desirable to employees and essential to employers.</p>
<p>We found significant behavioral-design failure points across three main areas: Their strategic framework for employee engagement and advancement; implementation process and templates; and goal setting and rewards.</p>
<p>To understand the companies&#8217; strategic framework, we examined upskilling and tuition reimbursement policies and spend; individualized employee future-fit assessments; tools for employee career pathway modeling and advancement; and early-in-career and diverse-hire career-progression programs.</p>
<p>For implementation processes and templates, we examined onboarding; employee performance and development cycle; manager feedback; and succession planning.</p>
<p>For goal setting and rewards, we examined manager and VP-level goals and rewards connected directly to their activities and performance in developing and advancing employee careers.</p>
<h2>Take this employee development survey</h2>
<p>Let’s gauge your company’s employee development and engagement efforts. How many of the following can you answer with a “yes”?</p>
<ol>
<li>Has your company run a process to define skills or talent-gaps across organizations in the past two years?</li>
<li>As part of such a process, did your company define a role taxonomy for essential roles?</li>
<li>Do you have a process and the tools for mapping existing personnel to that taxonomy, whether from within or outside the relevant organization?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life exposed the personal information of hundreds of job applicants after a website bug allowed anyone to access their resumes, which were stored in an unprotected directory on its website.</p>
<p>A security researcher told TechCrunch that the group&#8217;s main website, built largely in WordPress, was not properly protecting the file storage on its website, which it used to store resumes of more than 300 job applicants, as well as other files uploaded to the website. The resumes contained names, phone numbers, addresses and details of a person&#8217;s employment history.</p>
<p>The website bug was fixed over the weekend, a short time after details of the leak were posted on Twitter. The group&#8217;s website no longer lists any of the exposed files.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking action to protect the concerned individuals,&#8221; said Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokesperson for Texas Right to Life, told TechCrunch, referring to those who &#8220;sought and circulated the information.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked, Schwartz would not say if the organization planned on informing those whose personal information was exposed by its security lapse.</p>
<p>Texas Right to Life sparked anger when last week it publicized a &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website that encouraged Texas residents to report when someone might be seeking an abortion in violation of the state&#8217;s restrictive new abortion law. The law allows anyone to sue someone seeking an abortion, or anyone &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; an abortion after six weeks. That provision has been widely interpreted as targeting doctors who perform these procedures, but also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293">potentially anyone</a> who gets involved, such as contributing money or driving a friend to a clinic.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website to be flooded with fake tips, memes and Shrek porn in protest. The site briefly fell offline Thursday, which coincided with an activist <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut">releasing an iOS shortcut</a> to help anyone pre-fill the website&#8217;s form with fake information.</p>
<p>But by the weekend, GoDaddy, the company hosting the website, told Texas Right to Life that the site <a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293">violated its terms</a> of service and gave the group 24 hours to find another host. It did — briefly — by way of Epik, a web host that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/the-far-rights-favorite-registrar-is-building-censorship-resistant-servers/">helped other controversial sites</a> like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/far-right-social-network-gab-goes-offline-after-godaddy-tells-it-to-find-another-domain-registrar/">far-right social networks Gab</a> get back online. But that didn&#8217;t last long either.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website pointed to Texas Right to Life&#8217;s main website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, a social networking app for women, initially found traction connecting women in the earlier stages of their motherhood journey. But over the years, the network expanded to support women through other life stages. Now, that will include menopause, as well &#8212; a life stage that will impact nearly half the world&#8217;s population at some point. But there are few online communities where women can connect and learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about this life stage for a long time, in terms of how it is so underserved,&#8221; explains Peanut founder and CEO Michelle Kennedy. &#8220;By 2025, there are going to be a billion women who are in menopause at that moment&#8230;and yet, when you think about what is there and accessible in terms of community, social [networking], and support &#8212; there&#8217;s literally nothing,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The company saw the opportunity in this market by observing what women were already discussing on the app, Kennedy says.</p>
<p>Although the app had historically skewed toward younger women just getting started with marriages and family, there were a number of women who had undergone surgical or chemically induced menopause because of something like breast cancer or some other medical condition. This had put them into early or premature menopause, and they began to discuss how that was impacting their life &#8212; particularly as younger parents. There were also women who felt like they may have begun to experience menopause but were having their concerns dismissed by their doctors because they were too young. They wanted to talk about their symptoms with others who were going through the same thing. Others, meanwhile, were older and entering menopause, and were in search of community.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198691" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198691" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Groups.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peanut</p></div></p>
<p>To address this market, Peanut is expanding with the launch of Peanut Menopause, a dedicated space in the app where women can meet others who are at a similar life stage &#8212; whether that&#8217;s other premenopausal, menopausal or postmenopausal women.</p>
<p>Women can join groups, ask questions and get advice, or even join live audio conversations hosted by experts, through Peanut&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">newer live audio rooms feature, Peanut Pods</a>.  And they can use the app&#8217;s matchmaking feature to discover other women who are also in their same demographic, where they can chat using messaging or video.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kennedy notes that the topic of menopause is something women have historically kept quiet about, often suffering in silence due to the lack of resources available to them when it comes on online networking and support groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are never going to build this for us, so we have to build it for ourselves,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have to build what we want and what we need.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peanut</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion may bring a broader group of women to Peanut. Today, the average age of the Peanut user is around 32, but the menopause-focused communities may attract women in the 49-plus age demographic, in addition to those who are going through the experience at a younger age, for other reasons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Peanut, not all investors see the opportunity in addressing the needs of menopausal women. In fact, on a recent phone call, Kennedy said one investor seemed dismayed about the expansion, noting they had really loved &#8220;the younger age demo.&#8221; Kennedy said this comment blew her away.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ln3LbmmzGL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">Social networking app for women, Peanut, adds live audio rooms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Social networking app for women, Peanut, adds live audio rooms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/embed/#?secret=Ln3LbmmzGL" data-secret="Ln3LbmmzGL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;They are women who are at a stage in their life where they probably have more disposable income,&#8221; she said of the new demographic Peanut is now including. &#8220;They are more considered users, in many respects. They&#8217;re not as flighty. They don&#8217;t have 30 apps on their phone, and the ones they have on their phone they&#8217;re really invested in. It&#8217;s just astonishing to me that someone in the investment community would make a comment like that,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Peanut is not yet monetizing its users and doesn&#8217;t intend to do so using ads. Instead, the company&#8217;s plan is to eventually introduce the freemium model where women will pay to unlock a set of premium features &#8212; a model that worked well in the dating app industry, where Kennedy has roots as the former deputy CEO at dating app Badoo and an inaugural board member at Bumble.</p>
<p>The feature is the latest in a long line of expansions over the years &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/peanut-the-matchmaking-app-for-moms-launches-a-community-feature-called-peanut-pages/">Q&amp;A forums, Peanut Pages,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/social-network-for-motherhood-peanut-raises-5m-expands-to-include-women-trying-to-conceive/">Peanut Groups</a> and, recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">Peanut Pods</a> &#8212; that have helped Peanut evolve into an online community that serves over 2 million users. The Peanut app is available as a free download across both iOS and Android, while a preview of its communities are <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/posts">available on the web</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI is everywhere in tech, and you can bet it will be a vital topic at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. It’s the driving force behind just about everything from rockets, robotics and customer service to deep science and autonomous vehicles. It’s even changing the game for dystopian fiction writers.</p>
