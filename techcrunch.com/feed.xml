		Williesha Morris has been a journalist and freelancer off-and-on for over a decade. When she’s not writing, she’s reading, playing video games or chatting about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, a product developer named Fred Davison </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43365521"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about inventor Ken Yankelevitz and his QuadControl video game controller for quadriplegics. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Yankelevitz was on the verge of retirement. Davison wasn’t a gamer, but he said his mother, who had the progressive neurodegenerative disease ALS, inspired him to pick up where Yankelevitz was about to leave off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2014, Davison’s <a href="https://www.quadstick.com/">QuadStick</a> represents the latest iteration of the Yankelevitz controller &#8212; one that has garnered interest across a broad range of industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The QuadStick&#8217;s been the most rewarding thing I&#8217;ve ever been involved in,&#8221; Davison told TechCrunch. &#8220;And I get a lot of feedback as to what it means for [disabled gamers] to be able to be involved in these games.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Laying the groundwork</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Muston-Firsch, an occupational therapist at Craig Hospital in Denver, says adaptive gaming tools like the QuadStick have revolutionized the hospital’s therapy team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years ago, she devised a rehabilitation solution for a college student who came in with a spinal cord injury. She says he liked playing video games, but as a result of his injury could no longer use his hands. So the rehab regimen incorporated Davison’s invention, which enabled the patient to play World of Warcraft and Destiny. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150099" style="width: 1048px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150099" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2150099 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg 1038w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quadstick1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1038px) 100vw, 1038px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150099" class="wp-caption-text">QuadStick</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pitbullreece/">Jackson &#8220;Pitbull&#8221; Reece</a> is a successful Facebook streamer who uses his mouth to operate the QuadStick, as well as the XAC, (the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>), a controller designed by Microsoft for use by people with disabilities to make user input for video games more accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reece lost the use of his legs in a motorcycle accident in 2007 and later, due to an infection, lost the use of his upper body. He says he remembers able-bodied life as one filled with mostly sports video games. He says being a part of the gaming community is an important part of his mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately there is an atmosphere of collaboration, not competition, around the creation of hardware for gamers within the assistive technology community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while not every major tech company has been proactive about accessibility, after-market devices are available to create customized gaming experiences for disabled gamers.</span></p>
<h2>Enter Microsoft</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its Hackathon in 2015, Microsoft&#8217;s Inclusive Lead Bryce Johnson met with disabled veterans&#8217; advocacy group </span><a href="https://warfighterengaged.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warfighter Engaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were at the same time developing our views on inclusive design,&#8221; Johnson said. Indeed, <a href="https://ultimatepopculture.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">e</a></span><a href="https://ultimatepopculture.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">ight generations</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ultimatepopculture.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles"> of gaming consoles</a> created barriers for disabled gamers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Controllers have been optimized around a primary use case that made assumptions,&#8221; Johnson said. Indeed, the buttons and triggers of a traditional controller are for able-bodied people with the endurance to operate them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Warfighter Engaged, Microsoft worked with <a href="https://ablegamers.org/">AbleGamers</a> (the most recognized charity for gamers with disabilities), <a href="https://craighospital.org/">Craig Hospital</a>, the <a href="https://www.yourcpf.org/">Cerebral Palsy Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/">Special Effect</a>, a U.K.-based charity for disabled young gamers. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150096" style="width: 1048px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150096" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2150096 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg 1038w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/XBOXPressTour-0754-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1038px) 100vw, 1038px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150096" class="wp-caption-text">Xbox Adaptive Controller</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finished XAC, released in 2018, is intended for a gamer with limited mobility to seamlessly play with other gamers. One of the details gamers commented on was that the XAC looks like a consumer device, not a medical device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew that we couldn&#8217;t design this product </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this community,&#8221; Johnson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We had to design this product </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this community. We believe in ‘nothing about us without us.’ Our principles of inclusive design urge us to include communities from the very beginning.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Taking on the giants</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were others getting involved. Like many inventions, the creation of the Freedom Wing was a bit of serendipity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At his booth at an assistive technology (AT) conference, <a href="http://atmakers.org/">ATMakers</a>&#8216; Bill Binko showcased a doll named &#8220;Ella&#8221; using the ATMakers Joystick, a power-chair device. Also in attendance was Steven Spohn, who is part of the brain trust behind AbleGamers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spohn saw the Joystick and told Binko he wanted a similar device to work with the XAC. The Freedom Wing was ready within six weeks. It was a matter of manipulating the sensors to control a game controller instead of a chair. This device didn&#8217;t require months of R&amp;D and testing because it had already been road tested as a power-chair device. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150094" style="width: 1048px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150094" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2150094 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg 1038w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AT-Makers-Freedom-Wing2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1038px) 100vw, 1038px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150094" class="wp-caption-text">ATMakers Freedom Wing 2</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binko said mom-and-pop companies are leading the way in changing the face of accessible gaming technology. Companies like Microsoft and Logitech have only recently found their footing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATMakers, QuadStick and other smaller creators, meanwhile, have been busy disrupting the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everybody gets [gaming] and it opens up the ability for people to engage with their community,&#8221; Binko said. &#8220;Gaming is something that people can wrap their heads around and they can join in.&#8221; </span></p>
<h2>Barriers of entry</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the technology evolves, so do the obstacles to accessibility. These challenges include lack of support teams, security, licensing and VR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binko said managing support teams for these devices with the increase in demand is a new hurdle. More people with the technological skills are needed to join the AT industry to assist with the creation, installation and maintenance of devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security and licensing is out of the hands of small creators like Davison because of financial and other resources needed to work with different hardware companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Sony&#8217;s licensing enforcement technology has become increasingly complex with each new console generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Davison&#8217;s background in tech, he understands the restrictions to protect proprietary information. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They spend huge amounts of money developing a product and they want to control every aspect of it,&#8221; Davison said. &#8220;Just makes it tough for the little guy to work with.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while PlayStation led the way in button mapping, according to Davison, the security process is stringent. He doesn&#8217;t understand how it benefits the console company to prevent people from using whichever controller they want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The cryptography for the PS5 and DualSense controller is uncrackable so far, so adapter devices like the ConsoleTuner Titan Two have to find other weaknesses, like the informal &#8216;man in the middle&#8217; attack,&#8221; Davison said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technique allows devices to utilize older-gen PlayStation controllers as a go-between from the QuadStick to the latest-gen console, so disabled gamers can play the PS5. TechCrunch reached out to Sony&#8217;s accessibility division, whose representative said there are no immediate plans for an adaptable PlayStation or controller. However, they stated their department works with advocates and gaming devs to consider accessibility from day one.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Microsoft&#8217;s licensing system is more forgiving, especially with the XAC and the ability to use older-generation controllers with newer systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Compare the PC industry to the Mac,&#8221; Davison said. &#8220;You can put together a PC system from a dozen different manufacturers, but not for the Mac. One is an open standard and the other is closed.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>A more accessible future</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Japanese controller company HORI released an officially licensed accessibility controller for the Nintendo Switch. It&#8217;s not available for sale in the United States currently, but there are no region restrictions to purchase one online. This latest development points toward a more accessibility-friendly Nintendo, though the company has yet to fully embrace the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo&#8217;s accessibility department declined a full interview but sent a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Nintendo endeavors to provide products and services that can be enjoyed by everyone. Our products offer a range of accessibility features, such as button-mapping, motion controls, a zoom feature, grayscale and inverted colors, haptic and audio feedback, and other innovative gameplay options. In addition, Nintendo’s software and hardware developers continue to evaluate different technologies to expand this accessibility in current and future products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push for more accessible hardware for disabled gamers hasn&#8217;t been smooth. Many of these devices were created by small business owners with little capital. In a few cases corporations with a determination for inclusivity at the earliest stages of development became involved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly but surely, however, assistive technology is moving forward in ways that can make the experience much more accessible for gamers with disabilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re diving into how Apple is defending its App Store fees amid the Epic lawsuit and how it responded to the other complaints raised by Spotify, Match and Tile in the Senate antitrust hearing. We&#8217;re also looking at new data that implies Facebook&#8217;s grip on social is starting to loosen, TikTok&#8217;s new features, tests and plans for e-commerce, security issues with Twitter&#8217;s Tip Jar and more.</p>
<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will soon be a newsletter! Sign up here: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/newsletters">techcrunch.com/newsletters</a></strong></em></p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Apple talks App Store fraud</h3>
<p><strong>Apple wants developers to know what they&#8217;re paying for with those App Store commissions</strong>. The company this week announced<a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fdf4z73i"> it stopped more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in 2020</a>, preventing theft of customers&#8217; &#8220;money, information and time,&#8221; it said. And it kept nearly a million &#8220;risky and vulnerable&#8221; apps out of customers&#8217; hands &#8212; meaning it rejected them from the App Store following their review. It also terminated 470,000 developer accounts in 2020 and rejected an additional 205,000 developer enrollments over fraud concerns. On the customer side, Apple deactivated 244 million customer accounts due to fraudulent and abusive activity, it said, and rejected 424 million attempted account creations because they &#8220;displayed patterns consistent with fraudulent and abusive activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, of course, didn&#8217;t just randomly decide to post these figures. Its App Store fees and their legality, of sorts, are on trial as part of Epic Games&#8217; lawsuit. The Fortnite maker alleges Apple is behaving as a monopolist by forcing app developers to use only Apple&#8217;s own payment mechanism &#8212; and by not even allowing developers to tell their customers where else they can make purchases, such as on the developer&#8217;s website, where App Store fees wouldn&#8217;t apply.</p>
<p>By publishing this data, Apple is attempting to position all the stories of fraudulent apps on the App Store as those that fell through the cracks of its much larger anti-fraud operation. That is, for all the mistakenly published fraudulent apps that Apple either <a href="https://www.imore.com/hilarious-phil-schiller-email-reveals-despair-temple-run-rip-2012">internally</a> fretted over, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta">those</a> that have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">now come to light</a> in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">press</a> (often now thanks to developer <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou">Kosta Eleftheriou</a>&#8216;s ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">efforts</a>), there were much, much larger numbers that Apple had stopped from making it through app review.</p>

<p>Where Apple&#8217;s case falls apart, however, is when Eleftheriou exposes how easy it is to find those scam apps after they mistakenly get approved. On his own, he&#8217;s building a tool that finds scams across the entire App Store. The question is, why can&#8217;t a multibillion-dollar company do the same &#8212; or even do more? A system that&#8217;s able to retroactively review apps that have both high revenues and a suspicious number of five-star reviews (amid a sizable amount of one-star reviews calling the app a scam), would give Apple&#8217;s app review team a good place to start a cleanup. The company has done widespread App Store sweeps in years past to get rid of junk, after all &#8212; maybe it needs another?</p>

<h3>Facebook&#8217;s dominance is slipping</h3>
<p>There are some signs that Facebook&#8217;s hold on the social app ecosystem is slipping. Already getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">beat by TikTok</a> and others as the most-downloaded apps of 2020, <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/most-downloaded-apps-april-2021">new data from Appfigures indicates</a> Facebook&#8217;s app has been seeing an increasingly smaller number of monthly downloads over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The Facebook app and Facebook Lite saw 15 million installs per week in May 2020, which dropped to 13 million in June 2020. As of April 2021, the number is now under 11 million &#8212; a loss of 23% of downloads in around 12 months. Meanwhile, a social app gaining downloads during this time has been TikTok, which saw 52 million downloads in April 2021.</p>

This year, TikTok will have 37.3 million monthly active Gen Z users compared with 33.3 million Gen Z MAUs on Instagram. Snapchat is still leading, however, with 42.0 million MAUs this year. However, TikTok is on pace to surpass Snapchat as well, with 89.7 million total MAUs by 2023, compared with Snapchat&#8217;s 98.5 million.</p>

<p><strong>The NHS contact-tracing app <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57102664">had a significant impact on lowering the spread </a>of the coronavirus in the U.K.</strong>, a peer-reviewed report states. The app was &#8220;used regularly&#8221; by 16.5 million people, or roughly 28% of the U.K. population.</p>
<p><strong>Apple is <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-again-seeks-dismissal-800-million-covid-app-lawsuit">again seeking to dismiss </a>an $800 million COVID app lawsuit.</strong> Apple rejected the app last year on the grounds that it didn&#8217;t come from a recognized health authority or institution.</p>
<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/14/apple-responds-app-store-anticompetitive/">responded to complaints made</a> by Spotify, Match and Tile </strong>during the hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/05/Senate-Subcommittee-Letter.pdf">In a letter</a>, Andeer reiterates Apple&#8217;s arguments, including that its commission structure is fair (e.g. it drops to 15% in year two for subscription apps; a 70/30 split is an industry standard); that the commission pays for far more than processing payments; that it doesn&#8217;t prohibit developers from communicating with customers &#8212; it only asks them to not do so inside their iOS app; and that it will provide access to UWB for Tile and others in its space, among other things.</p>
<p>Apple dealt some notable blows in the letter, too: it said Match had tried to implement shady pricing in Tinder that would have made an upfront six-month payment look like a subscription at one point, which is why it rejected its app update. And it refuted the idea that it used data from Tile&#8217;s retail sales inside stores to inform AirTag pricing, noting Tile &#8220;did not sell well&#8221; at Apple Stores.</p>

<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>

Later this month, Pok Pok will debut its first title, <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok Playroom,</a> aimed at inspiring creative thinking through play for the preschool crowd. The app will feature a range of creative &#8220;digital toys&#8221; grounded in the real world &#8212; no unicorns or fairies or talking animals here. Rather it will feature a diverse range of characters that represent the real world as it is. The subscription-based app will have no ads or in-app purchases, so kids are encouraged to play, not pressured to buy things. The company has pre-announced its May 20th launch, but users can <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">sign up on the website now</a> to get an email when the app arrives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab flew its 20th Electron mission on Saturday morning, but the launch ran into a significant issue just after its second stage engine ignited. The engine appeared to shut down just after the ignition, which is not what it&#8217;s supposed to do, and which is likely the result of an automated emergency shutdown process that would trigger in case of a system failure. Rocket Lab confirmed that the issue happened shortly after the ignition of the second stage and resulted in the loss of the vehicle and its payload.</p>
<p>The company last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/04/rocket-lab-launch-fails-during-rockets-second-stage-burn-causing-a-loss-of-vehicle-and-payloads/">encountered a mission failure in July 2020, when the vehicle and its payloads on Rocket Lab&#8217;s 13th Electron flight were lost</a> after an engine failure that occurred during the second stage burn. That issue similarly resulted from a triggered safety shutdown, meaning that while the rocket and its cargo didn&#8217;t explode, the spacecraft simply stopped operating, but didn&#8217;t reach its target orbit or release its payload.</p>

<p>This flight, called &#8220;Running Out of Toes,&#8221; was Rocket Lab&#8217;s third this year, and a paid, dedicated launch for customer BlackSky, meant to deliver an Earth observation satellite for that company to help power its global monitoring and intelligence platform. This mission profile also included a key test of Rocket Lab&#8217;s rocket reusability program, with a planned recovery of the first-stage booster used in the Electron vehicle that carried the satellite to space.</p>
<p>This was also the second time that Rocket Lab performed a rocket recovery, after picking one up post-launch back in November. The company implemented a lot of improvements for this second try, including upgrades to Electron itself, with a better thermal protection system and upgraded heat shield to protect the Rutherford engines that power the booster, which are designed to help the final reusable design keep those in good shape for future reuse post-recovery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rocket Lab issued <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/rocket-lab-experiences-anomaly-during-launch">a statement later on Saturday</a> noting that the second stage &#8220;remained within the predicted launch corridor&#8221; after its safety shutdown, and won&#8217;t pose any risk to the public or its teams. The company also noted that the first stage splashdown did occur as planned, and that the recovery team is on site in the Pacific Ocean to retrieve the booster, so that secondary aim of the mission appears to be on track for success, at least.</p>
<p>This anomaly will now result in an investigation in to the cause, which will be required before Rocket Lab returns to flight in order to ensure future missions don&#8217;t fall prey to the same issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has long maintained that its video streaming service, Prime Video, helps drive more sales on the shopping app. Now the e-commerce giant is testing what happens when it brings a video streaming service directly to the shopping app.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant on Saturday launched MiniTV, an ad-supported video streaming service that is &#8220;completely free&#8221; within the Amazon India app. MiniTV is currently available only to users in India, Amazon said.</p>
<p>MiniTV features web-series, comedy shows, and content around tech news, food, beauty, fashion &#8220;to begin with,&#8221; Amazon said. Some of the titles currently available have been produced by TVF and Pocket Aces &#8212; two of the largest web studios in India &#8212; or supplied by comedians such as Ashish Chanchlani, Amit Bhadana, Round2Hell, Harsh Beniwal, Shruti Arjun Anand, Elvish Yadav, Prajakta Koli, Swagger Sharma, Aakash Gupta and Nishant Tanwar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of MiniTV&#8217;s catalog is old-content, some of which content partners originally developed for other platforms or published on their own YouTube channels, a review found. Aspirants, for instance, is a show that TVF produced in collaboration with online learning education startup Unacademy.</p>
<p>“Viewers will be informed on latest products and trends by tech expert Trakin Tech, fashion and beauty experts such as Sejal Kumar, Malvika Sitlani, Jovita George, Prerna Chhabra and ShivShakti. Food lovers can enjoy content from Kabita’s Kitchen, Cook with Nisha, and Gobble. In the coming months, MiniTV will add many more new and exclusive videos,” the company added, without sharing its future roadmap plans. (Amazon quietly began integrating reviews and other web clippings &#8212; from media houses &#8212; on its shopping service in India more than two years ago.)</p>
<p>MiniTV is currently available on Amazon’s Android app, and will arrive on the iOS counterpart and mobile web over the coming months, Amazon said.</p>
<p>Amazon’s move follows a similar step by Walmart’s Flipkart, the company’s marquee rival in India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/flipkart-hindi-free-video-streaming/">rolled out video streaming service within its app in 2019</a>. In recent years, scores of firms in India including Zomato and Paytm have explored adding a video offering to their own apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152549" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152549" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2152549 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/N2B-markets-video-streaming-.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152549" class="wp-caption-text">The video streaming landscape in &#8220;N2B&#8221; countries &#8212; the nations with potential to help firms find their next two billion users. (UBS)</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon has also aggressively pushed to expand its Prime Video offerings in India in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; which recently partnered with Indian telecom network Airtel to launch a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/amazon-launches-mobile-only-prime-video-subscription-in-india/">new monthly mobile-only</a>, single-user, standard definition (SD) tier (for $1.22) &#8212; has secured rights to stream some cricket matches in the country. Amazon also offers Prime Video as part of its Amazon Prime subscription in India. The service is priced at 999 Indian rupees ($13.6) for a year and also includes access to Amazon Music and faster-delivery.</p>
<p>Prime Video had over 60 million monthly active users in India in April, ahead of Netflix&#8217;s 40 million users, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch). Netflix, which spent about $420 million on locally produced Indian content in 2019 and 2020, said in March that it will invest &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-to-release-41-original-indian-shows-and-movies-this-year/">significantly more this year</a>&#8221; in India. In the company&#8217;s recent earnings call, founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings said investment in India was more &#8220;speculative&#8221; than those in other markets.</p>
<p>Times Internet&#8217;s MX Player, which also operates an ad-supported streaming service, had over 180 million users during the same period, and DIsney+ Hotstar had about 120 million users. Their biggest competition in India remains YouTube, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">amassed over 450 million monthly active users</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But other than competition, video streaming services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">face another challenge in India</a>. In late March, Amazon issued a rare apology to users in the South Asian nation for an original political drama series over allegations that a few scenes in the nine-part mini series had hurt religious sentiments of some people.</p>
<p>Amazon’s apology came days after New Delhi announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules for on-demand video streaming services and social media firms</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The EU Commission recently proposed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/artificial-intelligence-regulation.html">new set of stringent rules to regulate AI</a>, citing an urgent need. With the global race to regulate AI officially on, the EU published a detailed proposal on how AI should be regulated, explicitly banning some uses and defining those it considers “high-risk,” planning to ban the use of AI that threatens people&#8217;s rights and safety.</p>
<p>We can all agree with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1682">sentiment of Margrethe Vestager</a>, the European Commission executive vice president, when she said that when it comes to “artificial intelligence, trust is a must, not a nice to have,” but is regulation the most effective and efficient way to secure this reality?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_1682">takeaways from the commission</a> are incredibly in-depth, but the ones that make the most sense to me are those that stress regulated AI should aim to increase human well-being. However, regulation should not overly constrain experimentation and development of AI systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>High-risk AI systems should always have unalterable built-in human oversight and control mechanisms. AI systems intended to interact with people or to generate content, whether high-risk or not, should be subject to specific transparency obligations. In addition, AI-based remote biometric systems in publicly accessible places shall be only authorized by EU or member state law and serve the objective of preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime and terrorism.</p>
<h2>Partnership between AI and humanity</h2>
<p>The set of laws and legal framework enacted in Europe will have a profound impact on AI regulation around the world, similar to the effects the GDPR regulations created over the past decade. But will these laws assist us in moving away from the EU-wide haphazard regulatory approach toward a singularity of common classification?</p>
<p>In my opinion, this will cripple AI development in the EU while China and the United States leap forward. It would limit the use cases and innovation of artificial intelligence and put the EU in a technologically inferior position globally. In the U.S, AI is being optimized to maximize corporate profitability and efficiency. In China, AI is being optimized to maximize the government&#8217;s grip on the population with the preservation of power. The overly regulated environment in the EU will lead to complete chaos when regulations in various EU bodies start contradicting.</p>
<h2>Negative effects on EU entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>A lack of investment in AI in the EU is a major factor why the EU is <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf">losing the AI race to the U.S. and China</a>. There are currently about 446 million people living in the EU and 331 million people living in the U.S. But in the EU, $2 billion was <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226538/ai-private-investments-by-area/">invested</a> in AI in 2020, while in the U.S., $23.6 billion was invested.</p>
<p>If the EU continues pushing with aggressive regulations and lack of funding, it will enjoy global leadership in AI regulations, but I won’t be surprised if many European entrepreneurs decide to launch their startups in more AI-friendly countries.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			To create an EU that is friendly to innovation and entrepreneurs, we must create a collaborative network of AI pioneers to lead the way.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In turn, other nations will take advantage of the EU’s push toward strict regulations by fostering innovation and generating a stronger hold on the future of global technology. A recent World Bank report showed the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europe-wants-to-set-the-rules-for-ai-not-everyone-thinks-its-going-to-work/">EU launched 38% of investigations into data compliance in 2019, compared to only 12% in North America.</a> With policies this stringent and burdensome to companies, it should be no surprise if innovators and entrepreneurs begin to move to more business-friendly parts of the globe.</p>
<h2>Regulation leads to relegation</h2>
<p>The regulation proposal suggests fines of up to <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/draft-eu-regulation-for-artificial-7284484/">€20 million, or up to 4% of total annual turnover </a>of the AI provider for noncompliance. If we consider prior EU legislation and subsequent lack of digital innovation, these proposed regulations will cause chronic stagnation of digital innovation and adoption in the EU bloc.</p>
<p>In short, if these regulations become law, the EU will not become a pioneer but a laggard. The “real” use cases of AI are yet to emerge, uncovering the true potential of AI. The massive bureaucracy for high-risk use cases will undercut any entrepreneurship or bottom-up innovation efforts. With historical markers trending to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e7152f72-2494-43fa-86fa-4a8236a4db12">EU heading to a recession</a>, now is not the time to stifle innovation.</p>
<h2>Put a human face on global AI … and show its value</h2>
<p>If AI is to be broadly accepted, we need a human face showing AI helping people solve their problems and challenges. We must highlight engaging stories that are true and showcase the real people behind them. For the population at large to accept the potential of AI, they must see people like themselves benefiting from the goodness of AI.</p>
<p>AI funding means, above all, startup funding. Startups form the bridge between the discovery and development of disruptive technologies to their everyday use by the general public. Europe is already doing a significant amount of planning, but must accelerate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2021/01/18/how-the-eu-is-leading-the-way-in-ai-powered-social-innovation/?sh=30675c956bb7">European venture capital is lagging behind the U.S. model</a>. Fast-growing startups are mostly dependent on American and Asian investors. This requires a rethinking of the investment culture and sensible promotion of a dynamic investment environment; for example, through the targeted relaxation of investment restrictions on the part of institutional investors.</p>
<p>We’re living during the age of “moonshots,” a time when entrepreneurs and scientists are able to go further than ever before. Competing in the next economy requires playing a new innovation game, one whose goal is to boost innovation tenfold.</p>
<p>In order to reach this level, incremental optimizations do not help. The focus needs to pivot to big innovations &#8212; moonshots. Taking risk is acceptable and implementation of a large and risky idea should become normal.</p>
<p>To create an EU that is friendly to innovation and entrepreneurs, we must create a collaborative network of AI pioneers to lead the way. Entrepreneurs and data science leaders must use their energies to focus on AI for good to improve the world in the longer term and advocate for deregulation. To accomplish this, we need to set up a global AI pioneers council on AI for good, consisting of participants from leading research institutions, businesses, the public sector and civil society to develop a shared understanding of best practices.</p>
<p>AI is no longer just a tool for optimizing corporate systems and societal infrastructures; its potential reaches much further into solving the various crises facing mankind, from climate change to uncontrolled pandemics. Responsible AI and AI for good application across all the world’s superpowers can address these crises.</p>
<p>The EU cannot afford to be the region of the globe disincentivizing innovation and discouraging entrepreneurship. The EU must move not toward super regulation, but toward strategic leadership of AI based on AI for good. The path of overregulation leads to the depths of stagnation. It is up to the EU to decide what it wants its future to look like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> isn&#8217;t widely known yet outside of the crypto community. But insiders think the blockchain platform is interesting for a wide variety of reasons, beginning with its amiable founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, who spent more than a dozen years as an engineer working on wireless protocols at Qualcomm and who says he had a lightbulb moment at a San Francisco cafe several years ago following two coffees and a beer.</p>
<p>His big idea centered on creating an historical record to speed along &#8220;consensus,&#8221; which is how decisions are made on blockchains, which are themselves peer-to-peer systems.</p>
<p>Right now, consensus is reached on various blockchains when members solve a mathematical puzzle, a mechanism that&#8217;s called &#8220;proof of work.&#8221; These miners are rewarded for their efforts with cryptocurrency, but the process takes an hour in Bitcoin&#8217;s case and a minute in the case of Ethereum, and it&#8217;s insanely energy intensive, which is why neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has proved very scalable. (Bitcoin&#8217;s heavy reliance on fossil fuel is the reason Elon Musk cited earlier this week to explain why Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin as payment for the company&#8217;s electric cars.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uHmttIQVKX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/embed/#?secret=uHmttIQVKX" data-secret="uHmttIQVKX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But there is another way. Indeed, crypto watchers and developers are excited about Ethereum and <a href="https://decrypt.co/70883/proof-of-stake-coins-surge-as-elon-musk-trashes-power-hungry-bitcoin">other currencies</a> that are transitioning to a new system called &#8220;proof of stake,&#8221; wherein people who agree to lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency are invited to activate so-called validator software that enables them to store data, process transactions, and add new blocks to the blockchain. Like miners, &#8220;validators&#8221; take on the role to earn more cryptocurrency, but they need far less sophisticated equipment, which opens up the opportunity to more people. Meanwhile, because more validators can participate in a network, consensus can be reached faster.</p>
<p>Yakovenko is enthusiastic about the shift.  We talked with him yesterday, and he&#8217;s certainly not rooting against Ethereum, saying it would be &#8220;devastating for the entire industry&#8221; if Ethereum weren&#8217;t able to pull off its transition to proof of stake given its mindshare and its roughly $500 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Still, he argues that not even proof of stake is good enough. The reason, he says, is that even with proof of stake, miners &#8212; and bots &#8212; have advance access to transaction information that allows them to exploit users, or front run transactions, because they can control transaction ordering.</p>
<p>Enter Yakovenko&#8217;s big idea, which he calls &#8220;proof of history,&#8221; wherein the Solana blockchain has developed a kind of synchronized clock that, in essence, assigns a timestamp for each transaction and disables the ability for miners and bots to decide the order of which transactions get recorded onto the blockchain. Yakovenko says doing so allows for greater security and &#8220;censorship resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps">explainer</a> of Solana in the outlet Decrypt, Solana has innovated other ways, too, including by forwarding transactions to validators even before the previous batch of transactions is finalized, which reportedly helps to &#8220;maximize confirmation speed and boost the number of transactions that can be handled both concurrently and in parallel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the speed of light is how fast we can make this network go,&#8221; says Yakovenko.</p>
<p>Certainly, Solana &#8212; which has sold tokens to investors but never equity in the company &#8212; has many excited about its prospects. In recent interviews with both investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/early-coinbase-backer-garry-tan-is-keeping-the-vast-majority-of-his-shares-because-of-this-deal/">Garry Tan</a> of Initialized Capital and CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/a-conversation-with-bison-trails-the-aws-like-service-inside-of-coinbase/">Joe Lallouz</a> of the blockchain infrastructure company Bison Trails, both mentioned Solana as among the projects they find most interesting right now. (We assume both hold its tokens.)</p>

<p>Others say on background that while they understand the developer benefits and need for more scaleable blockchains than Ethereum, Solana still needs more developer mindshare to prove its long-term worth and it&#8217;s not there yet. According to Solana itself, there are currently 608 validators helping secure the Solana Network and 47 decentralized applications (or &#8220;dapps&#8221;) powered by Solana. Meanwhile, there were reportedly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/valid-points-unlocking-ethereum-2-0-staking-explained">33,700 active validators</a> helping to secure &#8220;Eth 2.0&#8221; as of late December and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/which-crypto-dapps-are-on-ethereum">3,000</a> dapps running on the Ethereum blockchain as of February.</p>
<p>In fairness, the Ethereum network went live in 2015, so it has a three-year head start on Solana. In the meantime, Solana has a lead of its own, says Yakovenko, who is based in San Francisco and has assembled a distributed team of 50 employees, including numerous former Qualcomm colleagues. Asked about other projects that have embraced a proof-of-history approach, he says that while it&#8217;s &#8220;all open source&#8221; and &#8220;anybody can go do it,&#8221; there &#8220;isn&#8217;t a set of our biggest competitors saying they&#8217;re going to rework their system and use this.&#8221;</p>
<p>One likely reason is that it&#8217;s almost comically complicated. &#8220;It just takes a lot of work to build these systems,&#8221; Yakovenko says. &#8220;It takes two to three years to build a new layer one, and you can&#8217;t really take an idea for one and stuff it in the other one. If you try to do that, you&#8217;re going to set yourself back by six to nine months at the least and potentially introduce bugs and vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, Solana, which itself has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOL1-USD/">$12 billion</a> market cap, isn&#8217;t interested in competing with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies on every front, suggests Yakovenko. All it really wants is to completely disrupt Wall Street and the rest of the global markets.</p>
<p>He knows it sounds crazy. But the way he sees it, what Solana is building is &#8220;an open, fair, censorship-resistant global marketplace&#8221; that&#8217;s better than anything inside of the New York Stock Exchange or any other means of settling trades. It&#8217;s certainly a much bigger opportunity than he imagined backed at that cafe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything that we do to make this thing faster and faster results in this better censorship resistance and therefore better markets,&#8221; he said yesterday. &#8220;And price discovery is what I imagine is the killer use case for decentralized public networks. Can we be the world&#8217;s price discovery engine? That&#8217;s an interesting question to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He&#8217;s far from alone in pondering the growing possibilities. Pointing to the wild swings in cryptocurrency prices right now, he says he suspects that &#8220;part of that is just developers and folks discovering the network and building cool applications on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting when people can &#8220;self serve and build stuff that they want to go to market,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;It&#8217;s the secret weapon of decentralized networks versus any incumbents like Bank of America or Visa or whatever. Those big companies can&#8217;t iterate and move as fast as a global set of engineers who can just come together and code whenever they want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw very similar dynamics play at Qualcomm, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working in a big company, it seems like there&#8217;s a ton of resources and they can accomplish anything. But you saw us working on proprietary operating systems while the Linux guys were just working first for fun, right? And it seemed like it was just a weird hobby that people had; they were coding operating systems at night; they were coding over the weekend. Then all of a sudden, Linux is the de facto mobile iOS of Android.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Twilio had a market cap approaching $56 billion and more than 200,000 customers, the cloud-communications platform developed a secret sauce to fuel its growth: a developer-focused model that dispensed with traditional marketing rules.</p>
<p>Software companies that sell directly to end users share a simple framework for managing growth that leverages discoverability, desirability and do-ability — the “aha!” moment where a consumer is able to incorporate a new product into their workflow.</p>
<p>Data show that traditional marketing doesn’t work on developers, and it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re impervious to a sales pitch. Builders just want reliable tools that are easy to use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, companies that are looking to create and sell software to developers at scale must toss their B2B playbooks and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/saas-companies-can-grow-to-20m-arr-by-selling-exclusively-to-developers/">meet their customers where they are</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Attorney Sophie Alcorn, our in-house immigration law expert, submitted two columns: On Monday, she analyzed a decision by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security <strong>not</strong> to cancel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">the International Entrepreneur Parole program</a>, which potentially allows founders from other countries to stay in the U.S. for as long as 60 months.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, she responded to a question from an entrepreneur who asked whether it made sense to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dear-sophie-does-it-make-sense-to-sponsor-immigrant-talent-to-work-remotely/">sponsor visas for workers who are working remotely</a> inside the U.S.</p>

<p>Can you imagine making 13 attempts at something before attaining a successful outcome?</p>
<p>Alex Circei, CEO and co-founder of Git analytics tool Waydev, applied 13 times to Y Combinator before his team was accepted. Each year, the accelerator admits only about 5% of the startups that seek to join.</p>
<p>“Competition may be fierce, but it’s not impossible,” says Circei. “Jumping through some hoops is not only worth the potential payoff but is ultimately a valuable learning curve for any startup.”</p>
<p>In an exclusive exposé for TechCrunch, he shares four key lessons he learned while steering his startup through YC’s stringent selection process.</p>
<p>The first? “Put your business value before your personal vanity.”</p>

<p>In March, TechCrunch Daily Reporter Anna Heim was interviewing executives at Expensify to learn more about the company&#8217;s history and operations when they unexpectedly made themselves less available.</p>
<p>Our suspicions about their change of heart were confirmed on May 3 when the expense report management company confidentially filed to go public.</p>
<p>With a founding team comprised mainly of P2P hackers, it&#8217;s perhaps inevitable that Expensify doesn&#8217;t look and feel like something an MBA might envision.</p>
<p>“We hire in a super different way. We have a very unusual internal management structure,&#8221; said founder and CEO David Barrett. &#8220;Our business model itself is very unusual. We don’t have any salespeople, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar to the way companies must file a Form S-1 that describes their operations and how they plan to spend capital, TechCrunch EC-1s are part origin story, part X-ray. We published the first article in a series on Expensify on Monday:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant</a>” (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Explores the founders’ days with a P2P content distribution startup called Red Swoosh (Travis Kalanick’s venture before Uber) and how that experience influenced Expensify&#8217;s development.</li>

<p>Construction tech unicorn Procore Technologies this week set a price range for its impending public offering. The news comes after the company initially filed to go public in February of 2020, a move delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Procore filed again for a public offering, but its second shot ran into a cooling IPO market. The company filed another S-1/A in April, and then another in early May. This week&#8217;s filing is the first that sets a price for the Carpinteria, California-based software upstart.</p>
<p>But Procore is not the only company that filed and later put on hold an IPO to get back to work on floating. Kaltura, a software company focused on video distribution, also recently got its IPO back on track. Are we seeing a reacceleration of the IPO market? Perhaps.</p>

<p>If you have heard of Better.com but really had no idea what it does before this moment, welcome to the club. Mortgage tech is like pre-kindergarten applications — it applies to a very specific set of folks at a very particular moment. And they care a lot about it. But the rest of us aren’t really aware of its existence.</p>
<p>Better.com, a venture-backed digital mortgage lender, announced this week that it will combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021. The unicorn’s news comes as the American IPO market is showing signs of fresh life after a modest April.</p>

<p>The pandemic forced many employees to begin working from home, and, in doing so, may have changed the way we think about work. While some businesses have slowly returned to the office, depending on where you live and what you do, many information workers remain at home.</p>
<p>That could change in the coming months as more people get vaccinated and the infection rate begins to drop in the U.S.</p>
<p>Many companies have discovered that their employees work just fine at home. And some workers don’t want to waste time stuck on congested highways or public transportation now that they’ve learned to work remotely. But other employees suffered in small spaces or with constant interruptions from family. Those folks may long to go back to the office.</p>
<p>On balance, it seems clear that whatever happens, for many companies, we probably aren’t going back whole-cloth to the prior model of commuting into the office five days a week.</p>

<p>On a recent episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm invited Yext CFO Steve Cakebread and Latch CFO Garth Mitchell on to discuss when companies should go public, the costs and benefits of the process and when a SPAC can make sense. Yext pursued a traditional IPO a few years back; Latch is now going public via a blank-check company combination.</p>
<p>The chat was more than illustrative, as we got to hear two CFOs share their views on delayed public offerings and when different types of debuts can make the most sense. While the TechCrunch crew has, at times, made light of certain SPAC-led deals, the pair argued that the transactions can make good sense.</p>
<p>Undergirding the conversation was Cakebread’s recent IPO-focused book, which not only posited that companies going public earlier rather than later is good for their internal operations but also because it can provide the public with a chance to participate in a company’s success.</p>
<p>In today’s hypercharged private markets and frothy public domain, his argument is worth considering.</p>

<p>Ken Harlan, the founder and CEO of Mobile Fuse, writes about the perks and pitfalls of software development kits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The digital media industry often talks about how much influence, dominance and power entities like Google and Facebook have,&#8221; Harlan writes. &#8220;Generally, the focus is on the vast troves of data and audience reach these companies tout. However, there’s more beneath the surface that strengthens the grip these companies have on both app developers and publishers alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality, SDK integrations are a critical component of why these monolith companies have such a prominent presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Exchange caught up with Appian CEO Matt Calkins after his enterprise app software company reported its first-quarter performance to discuss the low-code market and what he’s hearing in customer meetings. To round out our general thesis — and shore up our somewhat bratty headline — we’ve compiled a list of recent low-code and no-code venture capital rounds, of which there are many.</p>
<p>As we’ll show, the pace at which venture capitalists are putting funds into companies that fall into our two categories is pretty damn rapid, which implies that they are doing well as a cohort. We can infer as much because it has become clear in recent quarters that while today’s private capital market is stupendous for some startups, it’s harder than you’d think for others.</p>

<p>Historically — and based on what we’re seeing in this fantastical filing — Bird proved to be a simply awful business. Its results from 2019 and 2020 describe a company with a huge cost structure and unprofitable revenue, per filings. After posting negative gross profit in both of the most recent full-year periods, Bird’s initial model appears to have been defeated by the market.</p>
<p>What drove the company’s hugely unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses? Unit economics that were nearly comically destructive.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Today, we live in a world of product-led growth, where engineers (and the software they have built) are the biggest differentiator,&#8221; says Coatue Management general partner Caryn Marooney and investor David Cahn. &#8220;If your customers love what you’re building, you’re headed in the right direction. If they don’t, you’re not.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, even the most successful product-led growth companies will reach a tipping point, because no matter how good their product is, they’ll need to figure out how to expand their customer base and grow from a startup into a $1 billion+ revenue enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer is the hamburger model. Why call it that? Because the best go-to-market (GTM) strategies for startups are like hamburgers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The bottom bun:</strong> Bottom-up GTM.</li>
<li><strong>The burger:</strong> Your product.</li>
<li><strong>The top bun:</strong> Enterprise sales.&#8221;</li>

<p>Scott Lenet, the president of Touchdown Ventures, asks how deal-makers should think about how to handle themselves when counter-parties attempt to change an agreement. &#8220;When is it OK to modify terms, and when should deal-makers stand firm?&#8221; he asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs and investors should recognize that contracts are worth very little without the ongoing relationship management that keeps all parties aligned. Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path. In my experience, good communication is the only reliable remedy. <em>This</em> is the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search engine optimization, PR, paid marketing, emails, social — marketing and communications is crowded with techniques, channels, solutions and acronyms,&#8221; writes Dominik Angerer, CEO and co-founder of Storyblok, which provides best practice guidance for startups on how to build a sustainable approach to marketing their content. &#8220;It’s little wonder that many startups strapped for time and money find defining and executing a sustainable marketing campaign a daunting prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheer number of options makes it difficult to determine an effective approach, and my view is that this complexity often obscures the obvious answer: A startup’s best marketing asset is its story.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Wrapping the week here at Daily Crunch with a big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pickavet">Henry</a> for taking over yesterday and a fist bump to everyone who has written in with notes on its format. We’re still tinkering, so your notes are read and (mostly) appreciated, even if we can’t respond to everyone.</p>
<p>Stick with us as we get this fully figured out. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/"><strong>Coding school drama</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The market for coding schools and bootcamps is not going to go away so long as there is an outsized market demand for developers that current educational methods can’t fulfill. But not every player in the market is doing well. Lambda School, for example, is in even more hot water this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/edtech-stocks-are-getting-hammered-but-vcs-keep-writing-checks/"><strong>VCs love edtech</strong></a><strong>: </strong>While private investors are happily pouring capital into the edtech startup market, the share prices of many public edtech companies are under fire. That’s a sentiment gap that TechCrunch is keeping close tabs on. More <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">here</a> on the edtech venture market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/deadline-extended-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/"><strong>Apply to Startup Battlefield</strong></a><strong>: </strong>There’s not a lot of time left to apply to the upcoming Disrupt Startup Battlefield. And we want to hear from you. Really. Many startups that have taken part in our free and fun and very public pitch-off have gone on to raise lots of capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">or even go public</a>. So hang out with us; we think you’re great!</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool/"><strong>Stripe buys Bouncer</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The progress of the yet-private Stripe as an online finance behemoth continued today with its purchase of Bouncer, a startup based in Brooklyn that TechCrunch reports has “built a platform to automatically run card authentications and detect fraud in card-based online transactions.” Fraud detection is a point of product differentiation among online payment companies, so this is a deal to watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/why-spacs-arent-targeting-african-startups/"><strong>Why aren’t more African startups going public?</strong></a> The SPAC boom is taking a host of American startups public, but not upstart tech companies from Africa. The real issue could simply be one of scale, it turns out. TechCrunch investigates.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/hundreds-of-spacs-waiting-in-the-woods/"><strong>SoftBank makes piles of money</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some of the bets that SoftBank has made on its own, and via its Vision Fund 1 and 2, have been clunkers. WeWork remains a byword for embarrassment. But the teleco and investing powerhouse has been on a heater lately, as TechCrunch’s Equity Podcast explored. How good were its results? Very, very well. More on its investing performance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/echelon-leaky-api-riders-account-data/"><strong>Don’t leak customer account data</strong></a><strong>: </strong>An exercise startup that competes with Peloton didn’t have its cybersecurity house in order. Echelon, TechCrunch reports, “had a leaky API that let virtually anyone access riders’ account information.” That’s all kinds of not good. And the news item explains why cybersecurity has been so hot lately. More tech everywhere means more potential vulnerabilities everywhere, as well.</p>
<h2>5 ways to raise your startup’s PR game</h2>
<p>By now, it&#8217;s widely understood that storytelling is the foundation for successful startup PR.</p>
<p>Tech journalists receive more pitches than we can count each day from very early-stage companies seeking to make a name for themselves, and, to be honest, most of them sound like they were written with language-prediction technology.</p>
<p>What most companies fail to grasp is that storytelling is everyone&#8217;s job, like product managers who write blog posts that give users real insights into the latest release. The same holds true for founders who take part in Reddit AMAs and engineers who join product Slack chats.</p>
<p>To make a splash and stay relevant, here are five actionable suggestions that won’t cost a dime to implement.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Wrapping up news from the biggest tech companies this week, a short digest of earnings results from companies that you care about is in order.</p>
<p>Coinbase met its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">pre-released Q1 2020 earnings expectations</a>, posting both huge revenue and profit gains. In short, the first quarter was a huge win for the crypto trading house. It had the same sort of quarter that likely led to Robinhood filing to go public.</p>
<p>DoorDash blew the, er, doors off <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Releases-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">its own quarter</a>, leading to its shares spiking by around 25% in today’s trading. That’s one hell of a result. Sure, DoorDash is worth a lot less than it was at its peak, but the company had a great day all the same.</p>
<p>Airbnb managed a roughly 2.5% gain today after reporting <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-first-quarter-2021-financial-results/">its own earnings</a> yesterday. It also got an analyst upgrade to boot. In short, the company managed year-over-year revenue growth, but also detailed larger-than-anticipated losses thanks to some one-time items. Worth around $85 billion, Airbnb remains richly valued.</p>
<p>And then there was Alibaba, which has lost <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/alibaba-earnings-q4-net-loss-after-2point8-billion-antitrust-fine.html">around a quarter-trillion in value</a> since it got into a scrap with its local administration and <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210513.pdf">swung to a loss</a> after it was served with a multibillion dollar fine by the Chinese government. But the e-commerce giant’s $28.6 billion in total revenue was up 64% compared to its year-ago result. Hot <em>dang</em>.</p>
<p>Now you are all caught up! Have a lovely weekend, and we’ll see you again Monday afternoon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve seen a good Easter egg out of Google. Not too long ago it felt like someone would discover a new hidden gag in Google&#8217;s products every few weeks. The company cranked them out like it was their job.</p>
<p>While we haven&#8217;t seen as many new ones pop up lately, it looks like they&#8217;re still finding their way in. The latest: with the right search terms, you can make the Google search page act like an early aughts media player thats been left idling too long.</p>
<p><strong>How to activate it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Be on Google on a desktop browser. It doesn&#8217;t seem to work on mobile.</li>
<li>Search for &#8220;DVD screensaver&#8221;. &#8220;DVD bouncing logo&#8221; appears to work, as well.</li>
<li>Wait about five seconds and the logo should start a-bouncin&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#8217;s the point? Like most good easter eggs, the only answer to that is &#8220;I dunno, it&#8217;s fun!&#8221; Kill time by seeing if it ever hits the corner. Tell your co-workers about it so they know <em>for a fact</em> you&#8217;re reading dumb stuff on the Internet instead of working. Happy Friday!</p>
<p><em>[As far as I can tell, this egg was first pointed out on Twitter by Google engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/_zouhir/status/1392608904178135042">Zouhir Chahoud</a>. Thanks Zouhir!]</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[We decided to dig into the company's financials to see just what challenges Bill Staples might face as he moves into the corner office.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Bill Staples, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/new-relic-is-bringing-in-a-new-ceo-as-founder-lew-cirne-moves-to-executive-chairman-role/">the freshly appointed CEO</a> at New Relic, who takes over on July 1, yesterday was a good day. After more than 20 years in the industry, he was given his own company to run. It&#8217;s quite an accomplishment, but now the hard work begins.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			On the positive side of the equation, New Relic is one of the market leaders in the application performance monitoring space.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Lew Cirne, New Relic’s founder and CEO, who is stepping into the executive chairman role, spent the last several years rebuilding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/new-relic-shifts-with-changing-monitoring-landscape/">the company&#8217;s platform</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/">changing its revenue model</a>, aiming for what he hopes is long-term success.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the work we did in re-platforming our data tier and our user interface and the migration to consumption business model, that&#8217;s not so we can be a $1 billion New Relic &#8212; it&#8217;s so we can be a multibillion-dollar New Relic. And we are willing to forgo some short-term opportunity and take some short-term pain in order to set us up for long-term success,&#8221; Cirne told TechCrunch after yesterday&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>On the positive side of the equation, New Relic is one of the market leaders in the application performance monitoring space. <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-performance-monitoring/">Gartner has the company</a> in third place behind Dynatrace and Cisco AppDynamics, and ahead of DataDog. While the Magic Quadrant might not be gospel, it does give you a sense of the relative market positions of each company in a given space.</p>
<p>New Relic competes in the application performance monitoring business, or APM for short. APM enables companies to keep tabs on the health of their applications. That allows them to cut off problems before they happen, or at least figure out why something is broken more quickly. In a world where users can grow frustrated quickly, APM is an important part of the customer experience infrastructure. If your application isn&#8217;t working well, customers won&#8217;t be happy with the experience and quickly find a rival service to use.</p>
<p>In addition to yesterday&#8217;s CEO announcement, New Relic reported earnings. TechCrunch decided to dig into the company&#8217;s financials to see just what challenges Staples may face as he moves into the corner office. The resulting picture is one that shows a company doing hard work for a more future-aligned product map and business model, albeit one that may not generate the sort of near-term growth that gives Staples ample breathing room with public investors.</p>
<h2>Near-term growth, long-term hopes</h2>
<p>Making long-term bets on a company’s product and business model future can be difficult for Wall Street to swallow in the near term. But such work can garner an incredibly lucrative result; Adobe is a good example of a company that went from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/adobes-complex-journey-from-boxes-to-the-cloud/">license sales to subscription incomes</a>. There are others in the midst of similar transitions, and they often take growth penalties as older revenues are recycled in favor of a new top line.</p>
<p>So when we observe New Relic’s recent result and guidance for the rest of the year, we’re more looking for future signs of life than quick gains.</p>
<p>Starting with the basics, New Relic had a better-than-anticipated quarter. An <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3696166-new-relic-eps-beats-0_19-beats-on-revenue">analysis</a> showed the company’s profit and adjusted profit per share both beat expectations. And the company announced $173 million in total revenue, around $6 million more than the market expected.</p>
<p>So, did its shares rise? Yes, but just 5%, leaving them far under their 52-week high. Why such a modest bump after so strong a report? The company’s guidance, we reckon. Per New Relic, it expects its current quarter to bring 6% to 7% growth compared to the year-ago period. And it anticipates roughly 6% growth for its current fiscal year (its fiscal 2022, which will conclude at the end of calendar Q1 2022).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Governor Gavin Newsom, a vocal proponent of electric vehicles, on Friday debuted a new proposal that would earmark $3.2 billion to boost EV infrastructure and adoption in the state.</p>
<p>“This is a big deal,” Newsom said at a press conference Friday. &#8220;The Biden administration&#8217;s been talking a lot about this, they’re hoping to do something with the Senate, but we’re doing it. We’re not waiting around.”</p>
<p>Over half of the $3.2 billion budget would go toward replacing 1,150 trucks, 1,000 transit buses and 1,000 school buses with electric models. Another $800 million would be put toward the state’s Clean Cars 4 All program, which aims to help lower-income drivers upgrade to a zero- or near-zero car, as well as further rebates or clean vehicles. The proposal earmarks $500 million toward infrastructure and $250 million would go toward manufacturing grants. Newsom did not specify what type of infrastructure programs would qualify; it&#8217;s likely those funds would go toward charging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Hyundai, we hope you are listening,” Newsom said, referring to the automaker’s announcement Thursday that it would <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-to-invest-7-4-billion-in-the-us-by-2025--301291011.html">invest $7.4 billion</a> in the United States to manufacture EVs through 2025.</p>

<p>“Let’s start to wake up to the opportunities not to be reliant on foreign adversaries or interventions from those looking to extract resources through cyberattacks and/or other foreign governments that can abuse their privileges and rights as it relates to security and availability of fossil fuels,” he said. His comments were likely in reference to the recent cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which has led to gas shortages in swathes of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The funds are a small sliver of his proposed $100 billion economic recovery package, dubbed “California Roars Back.” If it’s approved by the state legislature, it would be the largest recovery plan in the state&#8217;s history. Other proposals included in the package are nearly $1 billion to improve the state electric grid and invest in energy storage, green hydrogen and offshore wind development.</p>
<p>Last September, Newsom signed an executive order to phase out internal combustion engine passenger vehicles from being sold in the state by 2035. Transportation accounts for over half of all carbon emissions in the state.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic has changed the way we work, including how and where we work. For those involved in the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) industry, a notoriously relationship-driven business, this has meant in-person boardroom handshakes have been replaced by <a href="https://www.themiddlemarket.com/news-analysis/virtual-dealmaking-is-here-to-say-according-to-dealmakers">video conference calls, remote collaboration</a> and potentially less travel in the future.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Research shows that AI will transform the M&amp;A process by decreasing the time it takes to perform due diligence to less than a month in 2025 from three to six months in 2020.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pandemic has also accelerated digital transformation, and deal-makers have embraced digital tools, sometimes even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/coronavirus-goldman-sachs-bankers-using-flying-drones-on-ma-deals.html">drones</a>, to help them execute effectively. Even legal M&amp;A professionals, often among the major holdouts to embrace remote work and technologies, are increasingly using technology to automate common time-consuming tasks, such as redaction and contract analysis. And with a <a href="https://www.datasite.com/us/en/insights/reports/legal-dealmakers-market-report--capitalizing-on-momentum.html">vast majority</a> of them reporting permanent remote or hybrid work arrangements, further technology adoption is expected.</p>
<p>The quickening pace of digital transformation is no longer about ensuring a competitive edge. Today, it’s also about business resilience. But what’s on the horizon, and how else will technology evolve to meet the needs of companies and deal-makers?</p>
<p>There are still many inefficiencies in managing M&amp;A, but technologies such as artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, are helping to make the process faster and easier.</p>
<h2>AI helping sell-side prepare deals and conduct diligence</h2>
<p>Typical deals require the analysis of huge amounts of data in a relatively short period of time. So, when time is money, tools that speed up the M&amp;A process are critical. That’s why AI-powered tools that help deal-makers automate tasks, reduce human error and ensure greater regulatory compliance are gaining interest.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to selling a business or asset, one of the most challenging parts of the M&amp;A process is organizing and preparing the files needed for review by potential investors or purchasers. Investment banking analysts often spend weeks reviewing thousands of files to figure out how to organize them and prepare them for a transaction.</p>
<p>Using statistical methods that allow a system to learn from data, and then make decisions, AI and machine learning leverage an algorithm to sift through those large volumes of data and content. Such <a href="https://www.datasite.com/us/en/company/news/media-coverage/m-atech--datasite-to-launch-new-categorization-tool-powered-by-a.html">a tool</a> can then enable the upload of hundreds or thousands of files and their review by an AI engine, which reads the files and suggests categories, as well as appropriate folder locations, for the files. AI and machine learning streamline the process in a matter of minutes, not weeks, freeing up deal-makers to focus on higher-value activities.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Whether you&#8217;re building a company or thinking about investing, it&#8217;s important to understand your strategic advantage. In order to determine one, you should ask fundamental questions like: What&#8217;s the long-term, sustainable reason that the company will stay in business?</p>
<p>The most important elements for founders to consider when figuring out their strategic advantage(s) include <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects">one-sided or &#8220;direct&#8221; network effects</a> (e.g., with social media sites like Facebook), <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeghaffary/2019/05/14/how-a-venture-capitalist-would-look-at-ubers-value-today-its-all-about-the-marketplace/?sh=996467732fbc">marketplace network effects</a> (e.g., with two-sided marketplaces like Uber), <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/business-moats-competitive-advantage/">data moats</a>, first mover and switching costs.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at an example of one-sided <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects">network effects</a>. At the very earliest stages of Facebook&#8217;s existence, it was just Mark Zuckerberg, a few friends and their basic profiles. The nascent social media platform wasn&#8217;t useful beyond a few dorm rooms. They needed a strategic advantage or the company would not make it beyond the edge of campus.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A successful startup without a strategic advantage is just a validated business model vulnerable to copycat companies looking for a market entry point.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In fact, Facebook only truly became a useful platform — and accelerated as a business — when more users came into the fold and more types of email addresses were accepted. Add to that the introduction of an ad marketplace revenue model and you have a clear strategic advantage — based on one-sided network effects — that gave Facebook a strategic edge over other early social media sites like MySpace.</p>
<p>These one-sided network effects are different from two-sided network effects.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152092" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152092" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?w=680" alt="A strategic advantage is paramount to maintaining market share" width="680" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=768,370 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=680,327 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=1536,739 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canvas Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>Two-sided network effects are most common in marketplace business models. In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets ">two-sided network</a>, supply and demand are matched, like Uber riders (demand) being matched with Uber drivers (supply). The Uber product is not necessarily more valuable just because more users (riders) join, the way Facebook is more valuable when more users join.</p>
<p>In fact, when more users (riders) join the demand side of the Uber network, it might actually be <em>worse </em>for the user experience — it&#8217;s harder to find a driver and wait times get longer. The demand side (riders) gets value from more supply (drivers) joining the platform and vice-versa. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a two-sided network, or a marketplace.</p>
<p>Regardless of industry, a successful startup without a strategic advantage is just a validated business model vulnerable to copycat companies looking for a market entry point. Copycats can range in size from startups with similar grit to large companies like Facebook or Google that have limitless resources to drive competition into the market, and potentially run the startup with the original idea out of business. This vulnerability can prove fatal unless a startup&#8217;s founding team explores and embraces one or more strategic advantages.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Apple, Microsoft and the like were scrambling to bring their respective developer conferences online, Google made the executive design to just scrap I/O outright last year. It was a bit of an odd one, but the show went on through news-related blog posts.</p>
<p>While we’re going to have to wait another year to darken the doors of Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheater, the company has opted to go virtual for the 2021 version of the show. Understandably so. Google apparently has a lot up its sleeves this time.</p>
<p>Last month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai teased some big news on the tech giant’s investor call, noting, “Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. Particularly excited that our developer event &#8212; Google I/O &#8212; is back this year, all virtual, and free for everyone on May 18th-20th. We’ll have significant product updates and announcements, and I invite you all to tune in.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the sound of it, next week’s event will find Google returning to form following what was a rough year for just about everyone. So, what can we expect from the developer-focused event?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141775" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg 2171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=2048,1303 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141775" class="wp-caption-text">Forest Row, East Sussex, UK &#8211; July 30th 2013: Android figure shot in home studio on white. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> juniorbeep / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Android 12 is the biggie, of course. From a software development standpoint, it’s a lynchpin to Google’s ecosystem, and for good reason has pretty much always taken centerstage at the event.</p>
<p>The developer version of Google’s mobile operating system has been kicking for a while now, but it has offered surprisingly little insight into what features might be coming. That’s either because it’s going to be a relatively minor upgrade as far as these things go or because the company it choosing to leave something to the imagination ahead of an official unveiling.</p>

<p>What we do know so far is that the operating system is getting a design upgrade. Beyond that, however, there are still a lot of question marks.</p>
<p>Google Assistant is likely to get some serious stage time, as well, coupled with some updates to the company’s ever-growing Home/Nest offerings. Whether that will mean, say, new smart displays on Nest speakers is uncertain. Keep in mind, hardware is anything but a given. The big Pixel event, after all, generally comes in the fall. That said, June is an ideal mid-marker during the year to refresh some other lines.</p>

<p>The likeliest candidate for new hardware (if there is any) is a new version of the company’s fully wireless earbuds &#8212; which the company has <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/">accidentally leaked out once or twice</a>. The Pixel Buds A are said to sport faster pairing, and if their name is any indication, will be a budget entry.</p>

<p>Speaking of which&#8230; earlier this year, Google made the rather unorthodox announcement confirming that the Pixel 5a 5G is on the way. Denying rumors that have been swirling around the Pixel line generally, the company told TechCrunch in a statement, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.” Given that the 4a arrived in August, we could well be jumping the gun here. Taken as a broader summer time frame, however, it’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility here.</p>

<p>Wear OS has felt like an also-ran basically for forever. Rebrands, revamps and endless hardware partners have done little to change that fact. But keep in mind, this is going to be Google’s first major event since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">closing the Fitbit acquisition</a>, so it seems like a no-brainer that the company’s going to want to come on strong with its wearable/fitness play. And hey, just this week, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/12/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-expansion-report/">rumor broke</a> that Samsung might be embracing the operating system after years of customizing Tizen.</p>
<p>Things kick off Tuesday morning <strong>May 18 at 10 a.m. PT, 1 p.m. ET</strong> with a big keynote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 million fundraise earlier this year</a>, payments giant <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> has been on an acquisition march to continue building out its business. In the latest development, the company has acquired <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, a startup based in Oakland that has built a platform to automatically run card authentications and detect fraud in card-based online transactions. Its technology is tailored for mobile transactions and includes a flow to help users authenticate themselves if they are mistakenly flagged, to come back into an app legitimately (hence the name).</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but Stripe is acquiring both Bouncer&#8217;s technology and the team, which will be integrated into Stripe Radar. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/stripe-debuts-radar-anti-fraud-ai-tools-for-big-businesses-says-it-has-halted-4b-in-fraud-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Started in 2018</a>, Radar is Stripe&#8217;s AI-based anti-fraud technology toolset, and most of the tech &#8212; which is focused around preventing fraudulent transactions on the Stripe platform &#8212; has been built in-house up to now. Stripe says that Radar already prevents &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud for businesses&#8221; each year.</p>
<p>“Bouncer is a great tool for modern internet businesses. It allows them to quickly identify stolen cards, while also ensuring legitimate customers can transact without being blocked,” said Simon Arscott, business lead for Stripe Radar, in a statement. “We’re thrilled to welcome the Bouncer team, and their years of experience building payment authentication software for businesses, to Stripe and to enable their technology for Radar users. With the addition of advanced card scanning capabilities, Stripe Radar will be able block more fraud and further increase revenue for millions of businesses around the world who rely on Stripe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal comes a couple of weeks after Stripe announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of TaxJar</a> to bring cloud-based sales tax calculating tools into its payments platform.</p>

<p>Like Stripe itself, Bouncer was incubated at Y Combinator, in its case as part of its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bouncer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer 2019 cohort</a>. In addition to YC, it had raised funding from Commerce Ventures and the Pioneer Fund, but had never disclosed how much it had raised in total.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Polish marketing technology startup <a href="https://www.usebouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, which provides bulk email verification, Oakland Bouncer was co-founded by Will Megson (CEO) and Sam King (chief scientist), who between them have an interesting pedigree when it comes to identity verification, from academia to working at fast-scaling companies in categories that have been some of the biggest adopters of verification technology.</p>
<p>Both previously worked for years at on-demand transportation service Lyft in fraud, identity and payment management. Before that, Megson was at Groupon; and King, in addition to holding a position as an associate professor of computer science at UC Davis, worked at Twitter on account security, founding the fake accounts team.</p>
<p>Groupon is among the customers that Bouncer currently works with, alongside OfferUp, ibotta and Dealerware. Bouncer will keep its current service and customers up post-deal.</p>
<p>Radar is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/pricing#radar-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently sold in a number of tiers</a>, ranging from free to 6p per screened transaction, depending on how it is being used (there is a more basic machine learning tier, and an enhanced tier for fraud teams, and the price varies also depending on whether customers are using Stripe&#8217;s standard pricing fees or something else). Stripe also offers a chargeback protection service priced at 0.4% per transaction, as well as analytics tools for Radar customers to get an overview of what is going on.</p>
<p>Stripe says that Radar has blocked more than $1 billion in fraudulent transactions since it was launched.</p>
<p>Bouncer is also <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently priced at different tiers</a>, ranging from free to $.15/scan for its basic solution, or a custom price for its more tailored services.</p>
<p>Integrating Bouncer&#8217;s card scanning and risk technology into the Radar stack will both sweeten the deal for people to buy those services from Stripe, but also make the tools more effective.</p>
<p>As Stripe describes it, when Radar flags a transaction, Bouncer&#8217;s card screening and verification technology will kick in as a &#8220;dynamic intervention&#8221; to confirm whether or not a customer had a legitimate card at the time of the transaction. This is done to help reduce false positives, which are more frequent in high-risk transactions (such as those for big-ticket items, or if a person has been making several transactions in quick succession, or other payment activity that just comes up as unusual in systems).</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been in a wave of new authentication technology that includes things like biometrics and other innovations, but Bouncer takes an approach that is less high-tech at the point of ingestion &#8212; needing only a phone&#8217;s camera and the card that the customer is using. When a transaction is flagged up and sent to Bouncer for verification, Bouncer works by requesting a picture of the payment card (which can be based on any payment card type and can be a low-light picture).</p>
<p>It then runs that through its PCI- and GDPR-compliant system to see if it&#8217;s stolen or real. If it&#8217;s real, the transaction continues; stolen and the transaction is cancelled. The whole process can take less than a second (not including the time it takes you to take a picture, of course).</p>
<p>For Bouncer, the idea is that Stripe&#8217;s machine learning engine will in turn help Bouncer become more effective.</p>
<p>“I’m excited that we’ll be able to scale our advanced card-verification technology across the Stripe network to help businesses grow their revenue while further reducing fraud behind the scenes,” said Will Megson, CEO of Bouncer, in a statement. “The same signals that Radar learns from will make Bouncer more effective, and Bouncer will, in turn, make Radar more effective. We couldn’t be more excited to join the Radar team.”</p>
<p>Stripe has made a number of acquisitions over the years to bring in key pieces of technology, and in one case &#8212; when it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayStack in Lagos</a> (another YC alum) &#8212; to help Stripe enter and serve merchants in Africa and more emerging markets overall.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stripe acquires Nigeria&#8217;s Paystack for $200M+ to expand into the African continent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/embed/#?secret=oYGf6wqZjp" data-secret="oYGf6wqZjp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At least two of these have been made in aid of bringing on technologists and technology to build out its compliance and authentication tools. In <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/stripe-acquires-teapot--3c1237bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Stripe quietly acquired Teapot</a>, a Silicon Valley startup that had been working on APIs for identity verification, trust, credit and other tools needed in financial transactions. Its co-founders spent some years at the company before moving on to other things.</p>
<p>In 2019, Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/stripe-acquires-touchtech-updates-apis-to-prep-for-strong-customer-authentication-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a startup out of Ireland called Touchtech</a> to bring in technology to prepare for Strong Customer Authentication regulations in Europe.</p>
<p>The need for better, more sophisticated tools to ensure online transactions are legit is not going anywhere fast. Malicious hacking &#8212; and the consequences that has for obtaining personal data that can be used in consumer fraud &#8212; continues to be a persistent threat. And in the meantime, e-commerce continues to become an ever-more mainstream activity, widening the pool of consumers and the chances of things going wrong.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of noise out there. The ability to effectively communicate can make or break your launch. It will play a role in determining who wins a new space &#8212; you or a competitor.</p>
<p>Most people get that. I get emails every week from companies coming out of stealth mode, wanting to make a splash. Or from a Series B company that’s been around for a while and hopes to improve their branding/messaging/positioning so that a new upstart doesn&#8217;t eat their lunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You have to stop thinking that what you are up to is interesting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>How do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?</p>
<p>Worth noting is that my area of expertise is in the DevOps space and that slant may crop up occasionally. But these five specific tips should be applicable to virtually any startup.</p>
<h2>Leverage your founders</h2>
<p>This is especially important if you are a small startup that not many people know about. Journalists don’t want to hear opinions from your head of marketing or product &#8212; they want to hear from the founders. What problems are they solving? What unique opinions do they have about the market? These are insights that mean the most coming from the people that started the company. So if you don’t have at least one founder that can dedicate time to being the face, then PR is going to be an uphill battle.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do to support these efforts. Create a list of all the journalists that have written about your competitors. Read those articles. How can your founder add value to these conversations? Where should you be contributing thought leadership? What are the most interesting perspectives you can offer to those audiences?</p>
<p>This is legwork and research you can do before looping founders into the conversation. Getting your PR going can be like trying to push a broken-down car up the road: If the founders see you exerting effort to get things moving on your own, they&#8217;re more likely to get beside you and help.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: It may be unreasonable to ask a founder to sit down and write a 1,000-word thought leadership piece by the end of the week, but they very likely have 20 minutes to chat, especially if you make it clear that the contents of the conversation will make for great thought leadership pieces, social media posts, etc.</p>
<p>The flow looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You</em> come up with topic ideas based on research.</li>
<li>The founder picks their favorite.</li>
<li>You and the founder schedule a 20-minute chat to get their thoughts on paper.</li>
<li><em>You</em> write up the content based on those thoughts.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has failed in its bid to prevent its lead EU data protection regulator from pushing ahead with a decision on whether to order suspension of its EU-U.S. data flows.</p>
<p>The Irish High Court has just issued a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/High%20Court%20Judgement%202021-05-14.pdf">ruling</a> dismissing the company&#8217;s challenge to the Irish Data Protection Commission&#8217;s (DPC) procedures.</p>
<p>The case has huge potential operational significance for Facebook, which may be forced to store European users&#8217; data locally if it&#8217;s ordered to stop taking their information to the U.S. for processing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">September </a>the Irish data watchdog made a preliminary order warning Facebook it may have to suspend EU-U.S. data flows. Facebook responded by filing for a judicial review and obtaining a stay on the DPC&#8217;s procedure. That block is now being unblocked.</p>
<p>We understand the involved parties have been given a few days to read the High Court judgement ahead of another hearing on Thursday &#8212; when the court is expected to formally lift Facebook&#8217;s stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation (and settle the matter of case costs).</p>
<p>The DPC declined to comment on today&#8217;s ruling in any detail &#8212; or on the timeline for making a decision on Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows &#8212; but deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us it &#8220;welcomes today’s judgment&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pMTvicyeM3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/embed/#?secret=pMTvicyeM3" data-secret="pMTvicyeM3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its preliminary suspension order last fall followed a landmark judgement by Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">in the summer</a> &#8212; when the CJEU struck down a flagship transatlantic agreement on data flows, on the grounds that U.S. mass surveillance is incompatible with the EU&#8217;s data protection regime.</p>
<p>The fall-out from the CJEU&#8217;s invalidation of Privacy Shield (as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">an earlier ruling striking down its predecessor Safe Harbor</a>) has been ongoing for years &#8212; as companies that rely on shifting EU users&#8217; data to the U.S. for processing have had to scramble to find valid legal alternatives.</p>
<p>While the CJEU did not outright ban data transfers out of the EU, it made it crystal clear that data protection agencies must step in and suspend international data flows if they suspect EU data is at risk. And EU to U.S. data flows were signalled as at clear risk given the court simultaneously struck down Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The problem for some businesses is therefore that there may <em>simply</em> <em>not be</em> a valid legal alternative. And that&#8217;s where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">things look particularly sticky for Facebook</a>, since its service falls under NSA surveillance via Section 702 of the FISA (which is used to authorize mass surveillance programs like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/07/ecj-ag-prism-opinion/">Prism</a>).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So what happens now for Facebook, following the Irish High Court ruling?</p>
<p>As ever in this complex legal saga &#8212; which has been going on in various forms since an original 2013 complaint made by European privacy campaigner Max Schrems &#8212; there&#8217;s still some track left to run.</p>
<p>After this unblocking the DPC will have two enquiries in train: Both the original one, related to Schrems&#8217; complaint, and an own volition enquiry it decided to open last year &#8212; when it said it was pausing investigation of Schrems&#8217; original complaint.</p>
<p>Schrems, via his privacy not-for-profit noyb, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-eu-us-data-transfer-complaint-schrems-gets-a-judicial-review-of-the-irish-dpcs-procedure/">filed for his own judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s proceedings</a>. And the DPC quickly agreed to <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/Settelement%20-%20DPC%20-%20Schrems.pdf">settle</a> &#8212; agreeing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">January</a> that it would &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize Schrems&#8217; original complaint. So things were already moving.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of all that is this: The last of the bungs which have been used to delay regulatory action in Ireland over Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows are finally being extracted &#8212; and the DPC must decide on the complaint.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, the clock is ticking for Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">expect another wordy blog post from Nick Clegg very soon</a>.</p>
<p>Schrems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">previously told TechCrunch</a> he expects the DPC to issue a suspension order against Facebook within months &#8212; perhaps as soon as this summer (and failing that by fall).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/">Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/embed/#?secret=Nz3q3sgbyu" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement reacting to the Court ruling today he reiterated that position, saying: &#8220;After eight years, the DPC is now required to stop Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, likely before summer. Now we simply have two procedures instead of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Ireland (finally) decides it won&#8217;t mark the end of the regulatory procedures, though.</p>
<p>A decision by the DPC on Facebook&#8217;s transfers would need to go to the other EU DPAs for review &#8212; and if there&#8217;s disagreement there (as seems highly likely, given what&#8217;s happened with draft DPC GDPR decisions) it will trigger a further delay (weeks to months) as the European Data Protection Board seeks consensus.</p>
<p>If a majority of EU DPAs can&#8217;t agree the Board may itself have to cast a deciding vote. So that could extend the timeline around any suspension order. But an end to the process is, at long last, in sight.</p>
<p>And, well, if a critical mass of domestic pressure is <em>ever</em> going to build for pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance laws now looks like a really good time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now expect the DPC to issue a decision to stop Facebook&#8217;s data transfers before summer,&#8221; added Schrems. &#8220;This would require Facebook to store most data from Europe locally, to ensure that Facebook USA does not have access to European data. The other option would be for the US to change its surveillance laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment on the Irish High Court ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company has now sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s ruling was about the process the IDPC followed. The larger issue of how data can move around the world remains of significant importance to thousands of European and American businesses that connect customers, friends, family and employees across the Atlantic. Like other companies, we have followed European rules and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and appropriate data safeguards, to provide a global service and connect people, businesses and charities. We look forward to defending our compliance to the IDPC, as their preliminary decision could be damaging not only to Facebook, but also to users and other businesses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you’re head-down and nose to the grindstone — I’m looking at all you hard-working early-stage startup founders — it’s easy to miss a deadline for an outstanding opportunity. Case in point: competing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p>
<p>We want every game-changing, innovative startup — from anywhere around the world — to have a shot at massive exposure to investors, media and other influential unicorn-makers. The $100,000 in equity-free prizemoney would be nice, too, right? That’s why we’re extending our application deadline for another full week.</p>
<p>It won’t cost you a thing to apply or to participate, so don’t let this trajectory-changing opportunity slip past you. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TechCrunch editorial team will vet every application and ultimately choose roughly 20 startups to go head-to-head. Each team receives weeks of free, rigorous coaching from our seasoned Battlefield team. Your pitch, presentation skills and business model will reach new heights of excellence. You’ll also be ready to deftly handle all the questions you’ll receive from our expert VC judges.</p>
<p>Startup Battlefield plays out over several rounds, with the field progressively narrowing. Each time you make the cut, you’ll repeat your pitch-and-answer session to a new set of judges. All that training, prep and focus leads to a final showdown and one last grab for the brass ring. And then it’s up to the judges to decide which stand-out startup wins the championship and that huge check.</p>

<p>While only one startup wins the money and the title, every team that competes benefits from standing in a global spotlight. Sean Huang, co-founder of Matidor, competed in Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020. His team was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">one of the five finalists</a>. Here’s what he said about his experience:</p>
<p>&#8220;Going through Startup Battlefield helped us simplify and improve our pitch. It helped us not only with brand messaging, but also to win other pitch competitions after Battlefield. By pitching in the finals, we booked a demo with one of the final panelists. We received inbound investment interest from 12 Tier-1 investors, and eight potential key clients came to our website for a demo session. We also received an endorsement letter for our Y Combinator application from a fellow Battlefield participant, with whom we formed a great connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>You’re head down and focused — that’s why we’re giving you a one-week extension. So&#8230; stop, look up and grab this opportunity to take your startup to whole new levels. Get your nose off that grindstone and <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on countless businesses across the globe, the $118 billion gaming industry not only survived, it thrived, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us">55%</a> of American consumers turning to gaming for entertainment, stress relief, relaxation and a connection to the outside world amid lockdowns.</p>
<p>This drove a 20% boost in gaming sales globally and created nearly 20,000 jobs in 2020 alone. And it’s not expected to stop any time soon: According to research company <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/video-games-industry/">IBISWorld</a>, the industry is set to grow again in 2021, adding to the year-over-year growth the industry has seen in the preceding half-decade.</p>
<p>This is great news for the growing gaming industry and especially those looking to score a job at a company developing the next blockbuster. The unemployment rate is <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/employment/video-games-united-states/">already near zero</a> for those with gaming development and design skills, which means there is an unprecedented opportunity to join the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>Gamesmith, a digital community dedicated to the gaming industry, currently has more than 5,750 open jobs posted on its site, with roles in design, engineering and animation leading the way. In other words, if you never considered a career in the gaming industry &#8212; or thought that your skill set wouldn’t translate &#8212; this expanding job market needs employees from all types of backgrounds. Chances are one of your interests &#8212; besides gaming, of course &#8212; can act as a conduit into finding a career.</p>
<p>One career path for those with art skills &#8212; particularly with a talent for digital art tools like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop &#8212; is animation. An animator can do any number of jobs at a gaming company or studio, from building immersive landscapes and cities to modeling what a certain character will look like to designing user interfaces and navigational components. There is significant growth here, too: According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005429/en/Global-Animation-VFX-Video-Games-Market-Report-2021-Strategies-Trends-Opportunities-2020-2025---ResearchAndMarkets.com">recent study</a>, most sectors of the animation industry are growing 2% to 3% year over year. According to Gamesmith, the average 30-year-old female artist or animator makes a salary of just under $90,000 a year.</p>
<p>If you’re a whiz with words and witty dialogue, then you might consider applying for a job as a writer at a studio. Writers are responsible for writing everything from the profanity-laced shouts heard in the background in the Grand Theft Auto series to the long speeches in epic adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Employers are looking for writers with a flair for crafting stories and understanding characters, so even if you’re not a career writer, highlight the work you’ve done that fits in the mold of what game publishers are looking for.</p>
<p>One of the most important segments of the industry &#8212; and one of the fastest-growing &#8212; is developing and designing the gaming experiences themselves. The job market for these roles is predicted to grow by 9.3% between 2016 and 2026, <a href="https://www.neit.edu/blog/video-game-designer-job-outlook#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Designing%20is%20one,9.3%25%20between%202016%20and%202026.">according to the New England Institute of Technology</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> and the breadth of jobs in this wing of the industry range from level designers to lead designer and developers.</p>
<p>Gamesmith calculated that these jobs account for 16% of the available openings, but make up only 5% of all applications. While you will need at least a computer science degree and an understanding of the fundamentals of programming to land one of these jobs, the payoff for the time spent hitting the books is worth it. Gamesmith estimates that the average 28-year-old male engineer earns a salary north of $100,000.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any of these skills to help design a game from the ground up, there are still plenty of ways to break into the industry. No matter how good a game is, it will only be a success if people know about it, so the marketing and promotions teams at studios play a crucial role in making sure that consumers purchase the latest release and that it gets written about. If you have great communication skills and can work through people’s problems, companies always need customer service representatives.</p>
<p>Across all sectors of the gaming world, companies are looking to diversify their workforce and move away from an image as a job sector solely populated by white men in their early to mid-30s. Gamesmith research found that currently 74% of the industry’s workforce is male and 64% is white.</p>
<p>But that is changing. While in 2020, only 24% of studios invested moderate resources into diversity initiatives, out of those studios that did invest those resources, 96% reported at least moderately successful results and improvements to company culture. It may seem slow, but there does seem to be a recognition that the gaming industry needs a more diverse workforce as a way not just to bring more equity to their offices, but to make better games in the future and make the industry look more like the people who play games.</p>
<p>“Diversity isn’t a nicety; it’s a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people who play games every day in this country,” said Jo Twist, the CEO of the U.K.-based gaming trade association Ukie. “A diverse industry that draws on myriad cultures, lifestyles and experiences will lead to more creative and inclusive games that capture the imagination of players and drive our sector forward.”</p>
<p>Between the push to diversify the industry and a slew of new opportunities in the field, the key takeaway is that there are a wide range of possible careers in the industry and, even if you don’t think they do, your skills probably translate into one of the many roles that a gaming company needs to fill. Avid gamers know that you’re not going to beat a game the first time you turn on your console. So hone your skills, build up your experience and continue your quest to land a job in the industry of your dreams.</p>
