										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing startup, has initiated the confidential process of filing for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The number of shares to be offered in the IPO and the price range have not yet been determined, the company said in a statement. Turo declined to provide additional information to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The eleven-year-old Turo’s marketplace is analogous to Airbnb, letting car owners post an ad to rent out their vehicle on its app and website. Cars are available to rent in more than 5,500 cities across four countries, Turo says on its website. That includes Germany, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/turo-raises-92m-and-acquires-daimlers-croove-car-sharing-business/">Turo took over</a> Daimler AG’s car-sharing subsidiary Croove alongside an investment deal.</p>
<p>The company had a $250 million Series E in July 2019, which pushed the company into unicorn status and “past the billion-dollar valuation mark,” CEO Andre Haddad said in a <a href="https://turo.com/blog/news/iac-invests-250-million-in-turo">blog post</a>. Turo followed that up with a $30 million extension round the following February, bringing its total funding to date to over $500 million.</p>
<p>Turo did not have a completely smooth ride during the pandemic; like other transportation startups Bird and Getaround, Turo laid off 30% of its workforce, or 108 employees, in March 2020 according to <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/2020/04/21/turo-laid-off-108-employees/">data tracker Layoffs.fyi</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Sexual harassment is, unfortunately, always in the news. Of late, it’s revelations at gaming giants and governments. Yet despite how prevalent harassment is, companies often adopt an “it can’t happen here” stance &#8212; until it does, and then there are knee-jerk reactions and crisis communications.</p>
<p>A better approach: recognizing how pervasive it is and planning with that in mind.</p>
<p>When I first started <a href="http://www.goethena.com/">Ethena</a>, I explained the concept of innovative harassment prevention training to my father. Like any good parent, he thought my entrepreneurial genius was actually a terrible idea and advised me to stay put at my job. But when he finally accepted that I was going to start this company, he said, “Make sure you don’t have harassment at your company. That would be bad.”</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. My team provides a modern compliance training platform. Since our first product was harassment prevention training, it would be pretty bad if we were talking the talk without walking the walk.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Train your team members to better understand inclusion and recognize what harassment looks like so the bar is set higher than “let’s just not get sued.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If I could prevent workplace harassment on optimism alone, I absolutely would. But I’ve seen the data on the prevalence of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>A 2018 <a href="https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/03161853/Pew-Research-Center-Sexual-Harassment-Report-April-2018-FINAL.pdf">Pew survey,</a> for example, found that 59% of women and 27% of men reported experiencing sexual harassment. And the rise of remote work hasn’t changed things. In fact, there are some indications that harassment is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/us/workplace-harassment-remote-work.html">on the rise</a> thanks to “keyboard courage.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Knowing that, I’ve come to terms with the fact that these are issues we’ll likely face, so I want us to be prepared. Today’s workplace demands that leaders acknowledge gray areas and engage with uncomfortable topics; it’s how companies grow in new and healthy directions. Here’s how we think about that growth.</p>
<h2>Plan for it</h2>
<p>As a Floridian, I grew up assuming hurricanes would hit my house. We always had some plywood and canned food because when you know something is going to happen, you plan for it.</p>
<p>Unlike prepared Floridians, startups tend to adopt an ostrich approach when it comes to harassment. Instead of stocking the pantry, so to speak, companies wait until they’re already in a storm.</p>
<p>Early on, a startup is a small group of (usually homogeneous) friends, and it’s uncomfortable to acknowledge that bad things could happen. It’s much easier to hope that building a team of stellar humans is enough.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, bad things do happen, because sometimes harassment is not as cut-and-dried as we are led to believe. Rather, harassment often grows from the complexities of human interactions — intent, perception, privilege and context, to name a few. It can start with a few small jokes, a colleague who gets drunkenly inappropriate every Friday, or a team that never seems to hire anyone outside of their social circle.</p>
<p>Then, things can escalate, and people start to realize that what they’re actually experiencing is a hostile work environment. Unfortunately, at that point, it’s really hard to right the ship because the company is suddenly 600 people and change gets harder as companies grow.</p>
<p>Knowing that problems are more likely as companies scale, it’s vital that teams prepare by learning how to identify warning signs early. At a bare minimum, train your team members to recognize what workplace harassment looks like and better understand inclusion so that the bar is set higher than “let’s just not get sued.”</p>
<p>Out of everyone at the company, managers really need to get the memo. As a company scales, senior leaders have a limited span of control, so frontline managers become the most crucial employees in either promoting or preventing inclusive workplaces. It just so happens that training is legally required in states like <a href="https://www.goethena.com/post/california-sexual-harassment-training-requirements">California</a> and <a href="https://www.goethena.com/post/new-york-sexual-harassment-training-requirements">New York</a>.</p>
<h2>Make feedback, not just “tell HR,” an option</h2>
<p>The traditional way that harassment is talked about is very binary. Either a workplace is perfectly inclusive or it’s a toxic cesspool. Obviously, it’s important to take these issues seriously, but the problem with treating every act as either fine or serious, capital-H harassment is that it gives employees a choice between bad and worse.</p>
<p>Let’s say Elena is on an engineering pod with Jonah, and Jonah occasionally does small things that cause her to feel less than included.</p>
<p>For example, they’re hiring for a new front-end engineer and Jonah always refers to this future hire as “he.” In the traditional, frowny-faced lawyer version of harassment, Elena has two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do nothing: Bad because Jonah is going to keep doing it.</li>
<li>Tell HR: Also bad. Elena doesn’t want to get Jonah fired. She just wants him to be more inclusive.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if training teaches Elena &#8212; and, ideally, everyone else on her team &#8212; to say something in the moment, Elena now has a tool she can actually use.</p>
<p>Next time Jonah says, “OK so when he joins … ” Elena can jump in with, “Unless you&#8217;re psychic, which seems unlikely given how poorly you did in Fantasy Football, please use ‘they’ to refer to our new hire, since we don’t know their gender.”</p>
<p>Did Elena <em>need</em> to insert the burn? Probably not, but humor can diffuse a tense situation so sure, why not? Regardless, once Elena says something, it’s on Jonah to accept her feedback and make a change; and, if team values are clear, hopefully Jonah’s colleagues will hold Jonah accountable, too.</p>
<h2>Accountability is everything</h2>
<p>This last lesson is only applicable after something at the company happens. Let’s say Jonah’s comments escalate, even after Elena gives feedback. Jonah consistently excludes Elena and other women from key meetings, talks over them, and when confronted, says, “Look, we all know they’re only here for diversity stats.”</p>
<p>If Jonah’s manager at this fictitious, problematic company does nothing, that’s the ballgame. There’s literally no amount of workshops, training, blog posts or all-hands meetings that can convince Elena that the company cares. Actions speak loudest.</p>
<p>The best possible version of dealing with an issue involves transparency so that people can learn from what happened and see that the company does care. Obviously, it’s hard when issues involve private information and protecting those who reported the issues, but to the extent possible, it’s crucial to have accountability.</p>
<p>Of course, my dad is right: Harassment at my company would be bad. But we’re preparing for it because scaling a company means rapidly increasing the number of human interactions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, building an inclusive company looks a lot like building a good company — preparation, feedback and accountability are managerial best practices that should be put in place early.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is further investing in its e-commerce business, Instagram Shops, with the launch of a new advertising product, Ads in Instagram Shop. The company says it&#8217;s currently testing the new format, which includes both single images and the option for an image carousel, with select U.S.-based advertisers ahead of an expansion to other markets in the months to come.</p>
<p>The company first introduced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/"> Instagram Shops</a> last year as part of a larger effort at Facebook to make its social platforms not just a place to connect with friends and follow favorite brands, but also an online shopping destination with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">integrated checkout experience</a>. Naturally, this type of initiative also lends itself to Facebook&#8217;s advertising model, as brands looking to connect with consumers could pay for expanded reach.</p>
<p>Like Instagram&#8217;s other advertising products, Ads in Instagram Shop will launch with an auction-based model, the company says. The ads will only appear on mobile, as the Instagram Shop tab is a mobile-only feature. However, how many ads an individual consumer sees will be based on how they use Instagram and how many people are shopping in the Instagram tab. The company plans to monitor consumer sentiment on this point, in order to balance ads and content.</p>
<p>Initially, Instagram is working with a handful of U.S. advertisers who will test the product and provide feedback, including Away, Donny Davy, Boo Oh, Clare paint, JNJ Gifts, DEUX and Fenty Beauty. These brands encompass some of the more popular categories of goods Instagram users like to shop for, including beauty, home décor, pet products, travel and more.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t yet disclosed an exact time frame for rolling out the ads more publicly, but says the plan is to expand the new format to advertisers in other, non-U.S. markets over the next several months.</p>
<p>The Instagram Shop tab has been one of the app&#8217;s more controversial additions in recent years, as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">replaced the popular &#8220;Activity&#8221; tab (heart button)</a> in the bottom navigation row &#8212; a change that made the app feel more commercially driven than in the past and alienated some users. Today, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/08/instagram-artists-leaving-social-media-tiktok-shopping">creative community is weighing its options</a> as Instagram distances itself further from its photo-sharing roots with other new additions, like its TikTok clone Reels, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX will be acquiring satellite connectivity startup Swarm Technologies, the first such deal for the 19-year-old space company headed by Elon Musk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swarm.space">Swarm</a> operates a constellation of 120 sandwich-sized satellites as well as a ground station network. The deal would transfer control of Swarm’s ground and space licenses to SpaceX, in addition to any licenses pending before the commission. If the transaction is approved, the startup would become a “direct wholly-owned subsidiary” of the larger company.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which was reported in <a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-T-C-20210806-00096/12345289">under-the-radar filings</a> with the Federal Communications Commission, marks a sharp departure from the launch giant’s established strategy of internally developing its tech.</p>
<p>The deal was reportedly reached between the two companies on July 16. The FCC filings do not disclose any financial details or terms of the transaction. Neither SpaceX nor Swarm could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>“Swarm’s services will benefit from the better capitalization and access to resources available to SpaceX, as well as the synergies associated with acquisition by a provider of satellite design, manufacture, and launch services,” the companies said in the filing. For SpaceX’s part, the company will “similarly benefit from access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team, as well as from adding this resourceful and effective team to SpaceX.”</p>
<p>What this means for SpaceX’s operations, particularly its Starlink satellite network, is unclear, as these satellites operate in a different frequency band from that of Swarm. In the short term, Swarm CEO Sara Spangelo told TechCrunch last month that the company is “still marching” toward its goal of operating a 150-satellite constellation.</p>
<p>Compared to SpaceX, Swarm is a relatively new company. It raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/swarm-technologies-raises-25m-to-deploy-its-own-150-satellite-constellation/">$25 million Series A</a> almost exactly three years ago, in August 2018, but it only went commercially live with its flagship product earlier this year. That product, the Tile, is a small modem that can be embedded in various connectivity devices and linked to the satellite network to allow users a low-cost way to power Internet of Things devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/facebook-ad-observatory-nyu-researchers/">close accounts connected to a misinformation research project</a> last week prompted a broad outcry from the company&#8217;s critics — and now Congress is getting involved.</p>
<p>A handful of lawmakers criticized the decision at the time, slamming Facebook for being hostile toward efforts to make the platform&#8217;s opaque algorithms and ad targeting methods more transparent. Researchers believe that studying those hidden systems is crucial work for gaining insight on the flow of political misinformation.</p>
<p>The company specifically punished two researchers with <a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/">NYU’s Cybersecurity for Democracy project</a> who work on <a href="https://adobserver.org/">Ad Observer</a>, an opt-in browser tool that allows researchers to study how Facebook targets ads to different people based on their interests and demographics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After years of abusing users&#39; privacy, it&#39;s rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems. I&#39;ve asked the FTC to confirm that this excuse is as bogus as it sounds. <a href="https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9">https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a new letter, embedded below, a trio of Democratic senators are pressing Facebook for more answers. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE) and Mark Warner (D-VA) wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking for a full explanation on why the company terminated the researcher accounts and how they violated the platform&#8217;s terms of service and compromised user privacy. The lawmakers sent the letter on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we agree that Facebook must safeguard user privacy, it is similarly imperative that Facebook allow credible academic researchers and journalists like those involved in the Ad Observatory project to conduct independent research that will help illuminate how the company can better tackle misinformation, disinformation, and other harmful activity that is proliferating on its platforms,&#8221; the senators wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/519454466/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-pInyqUcPWqyYPggal6If"  data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_519454466" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Lawmakers have long urged the company to be more transparent about political advertising and misinformation, particularly after Facebook was found to have distributed election disinformation in 2016. Those concerns were only heightened by the platform&#8217;s substantial role in spreading election misinformation leading up to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where Trump supporters attempted to overturn the vote.</p>
<p>In a blog post defending its decision, Facebook cited compliance with FTC as one of the reasons the company severed the accounts. But the FTC called Facebook&#8217;s bluff last week in a letter to Zuckerberg, noting that nothing about the agency&#8217;s guidance for the company would preclude it from encouraging research in the public interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising,&#8221; Samuel Levine, the FTC&#8217;s acting director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection, wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trendyol.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendyol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce platform based in Turkey, has raised $1.5 billion in a massive funding round that values the company at $16.5 billion. General Atlantic, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Princeville Capital and sovereign wealth funds, ADQ (UAE) and Qatar Investment Authority co-led the round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal marks SoftBank’s first in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing also makes Trendyol Turkey’s first decacorn, and among the highest-valued private tech companies in Europe. It comes just months after strategic &#8212; and majority &#8212; backer Alibaba </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/chinas-alibaba-invests-350-mln-capital-increase-turkeys-trendyol-trade-registry-2021-04-20/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested $350 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the company at a $9.4 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2010, Trendyol ranks as Turkey’s largest e-commerce company, serving more than 30 million shoppers and delivering more than 1 million packages per day. It claims to have evolved from marketplace to “superapp” by combining its marketplace platform (which is powered by Trendyol Express, its own last-mile delivery solution) with instant grocery and food delivery through its own courier network (Trendyol Go), its digital wallet (Trendyol Pay), consumer-to-consumer channel (Dolap) and other services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendyol founder Demet Suzan Mutlu said the new capital will go toward expansion within Turkey and globally. Specifically, the company plans to continue investing in nationwide infrastructure, technology and logistics and toward accelerating digitalization of Turkish SMEs. She said the company was founded to create positive impact and that it intends to continue on that mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evren Ucok, Trendyol&#8217;s chairman,  added that part of the company’s goal is to create new export channels for Turkish merchants and manufacturers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melis Kahya Akar, managing director and head of consumer for EMEA at General Atlantic, said that Trendyol’s marketplace model &#8212; ranging from grocery delivery to mobile wallets &#8212; “brings convenience and ease to consumers” in Turkey and internationally.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Turkey is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and benefits from attractive demographics, with a young population that is very active online,&#8221; wrote General Atlantic&#8217;s Kahya Akar via e-mail. &#8220;We expect its already sizable e-commerce market –$17 billion in 2020 – to continue to grow meaningfully on the back of growing online penetration. We think Trendyol is ideally positioned to meet the needs of consumers in Turkey and around the world as the company expands.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 </span><a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/turkey-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by JPMorgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-commerce represented only 5.3% of the overall Turkish retail market at the time but that Turkish e-commerce had notched impressive leaps in revenues in recent years: 2018 alone saw the market jump by 42%, followed by 31% in 2019. As of 2020, 67% of the Turkish population were making purchases online.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been there. (Or at least I have.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re getting ready to vacate a property you’ve rented, only to be told by the landlord that you won’t be getting your security deposit back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This happened to me the first time I ever rented a place in the late 90s. I was shocked, but more than anything, I was angry at the injustice because I knew that what the landlord claimed was not true. It was her word against mine and my roommate’s. Still, we took her to small claims court, not so much over the $800 she was trying to keep but more to prove her wrong. In the end, we won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was a lot of work, and a lot of time spent. If only there was some kind of technology available to have helped us make our case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today there is. <a href="https://www.getrentcheck.com/">RentCheck</a>, a startup that is out to help solve the &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; challenge in these situations with an automated property inspection platform, has recently raised $2.6 million in seed money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Winkler and Marco Nelson started the company in mid-2019 after Winkler experienced a similar situation to mine and ended up suing her landlord in small claims court. She was working on getting her JD/MBA at Tulane University at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an injustice for me not to pursue it,” she told TechCrunch. “I took meticulous photos of the move-out condition of my apartment. The process took 18 months. But not everyone has the time or knowledge to fight in court.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then met Nelson, who had bought several properties that he ended up renting out. He had issues with security deposits too, but the opposite ones. He had to settle disputes over deposits, and found himself documenting properties’ condition at the time of move-out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I met Lydia and we realized we were passionate about the same problem,” Nelson recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so New Orleans-based RentCheck was born.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187000" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187000" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2187000 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg 3813w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RentCheck; Co-founders Marco Nelson and Lydia Winkler</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are an estimated 48 million rental units in the U.S., with an average deposit of $1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A good chunk of that is being fought after on aggregate,” Winkler said. “And so many need that money to put down a deposit on another unit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the problem, RentCheck built a web app for property managers that they believe also benefits tenants. The company’s digital platform works by providing a way for property managers to facilitate and conduct remote, guided property inspections. For obvious reasons, the company saw increased demand upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, considering that the platform was automated and contactless. It saw 1,000% &#8212; mostly organic &#8212; growth in terms of the number of properties on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do is, using a guided inspection process, prompt users and guide them room by room, telling them exactly what to take photos of so that floors, ceilings, windows and walls are all accounted for,” Winkler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is done within the app so that users can&#8217;t upload photos that were previously on their camera roll “to ensure the integrity of the inspection” and that  everything is time stamped. Once the inspection is complete, whoever does it signs off on it that they completed it accurately and honestly. Then the property manager can also sign off on it so both parties can agree on the move-out condition.</span></p>
<p>The company operates as a SaaS business, and charges property management companies a subscription fee based on the number of properties that they have on the RentCheck platform. They can then conduct &#8220;as many inspections as they want,&#8221; Nelson says, &#8220;whether the residents are doing them, their internal teams are doing them, or a third-party vendor, or a hybrid of the three.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has attracted some large-name investors since its inception, first catching the attention of James &#8220;Jim&#8221; Coulter, the founder of TPG Capital, when the company won New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week. Coulter subsequently became one of the company’s first investors in its $1 million pre-seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s seed round included participation from Cox Enterprises, for its operations in the multifamily housing space, and angels such as Jim Payne, who previously sold MoPub to Twitter, and MAX to AppLovin; Ken Goldman, the former CFO of Yahoo, and who currently runs Hillspire, Eric and Wendy Schmidt’s family office; Mark Zaleski and John Kuolt of BCG Digital Ventures, and Brian Long, the founder of Attentive, who previously sold TapCommerce to Twitter. It also included institutional investors such as Irongrey, Context Ventures and Techstars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we love about RentCheck is that it’s using very clever technology to automate and solve arguably the industry’s biggest problem in terms of money and time for both property managers and tenants,” said Kuolt, former managing director at BCG Digital Ventures and an early RentCheck investor. “The deposit deduction issue needs a technology-based solution, and almost everyone, at some time, has felt like they’ve been screwed over on their deposit by a landlord. When you see and use RentCheck’s solution, it makes you think: ‘Why didn’t I think of this?’ ” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku this morning announced an expansion of its original content lineup, with the addition of 23 new Roku Original programs that will debut on August 13 on The Roku Channel free streaming hub. The new programing &#8212; which also hails from Roku&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">acquisition</a> of failed streamer Quibi&#8217;s catalog &#8212; will supplement the initial slate of 30 originals which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">first released in May</a>. Among the new programs are four shows that had not yet gone live on Quibi&#8217;s service before Roku purchased the content catalog for its own originals business.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vhv6DAdEJJ4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>These unreleased programs include &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-roku-original-eye-candy-josh-groban">Eye Candy,</a>&#8221; a &#8220;Nailed It!&#8221;-like competition series hosted by Josh Groban and inspired by Japan&#8217;s &#8220;Sokkuri Sweets;&#8221; &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/squeaky-clean-the-roku-channel">Squeaky Clean</a>,&#8221; a cleaning competition series hosted by Leslie Jordan; Season 2 of pay-it-forward reality show &#8220;Thanks a Million,&#8221; executive produced by Jennifer Lopez; and 10-part docuseries &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-what-happens-in-hollywood">What Happens in Hollywood</a>,&#8221; directed by Marina Zenovich, which details some of the industry&#8217;s most controversial secrets.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A-koKq7mX0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Other programs now arriving include: &#8220;&amp;Music,&#8221; &#8220;The Andy Cohen Diaries,&#8221; &#8220;Benedict Men,&#8221; &#8220;Elba vs Block,&#8221; &#8220;Fierce Queens,&#8221; &#8220;Floored,&#8221; &#8220;Gone Mental with Lior,&#8221; &#8220;Mapleworth Murders,&#8221; &#8220;Memory Hole,&#8221; &#8220;Nice One!,&#8221; &#8220;Nikki Fre$h,&#8221; &#8220;Run this City,&#8221; &#8220;The Sauce,&#8221; &#8220;Sex Next Door,&#8221; &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; &#8220;Skrrt with Offset,&#8221; &#8220;The Stranger,&#8221; &#8220;Survive&#8221; and &#8220;Wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku had praised the performance of its original lineup during its second quarter earnings last week, saying the new catalog had demonstrated &#8220;good performance,&#8221; without sharing specific metrics.</p>
<p>The company also said it would continue to invest in originals, but downplayed the size of their role in its larger strategy for The Roku Channel, where original programming is a smaller fraction of the content Roku offers its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Noted Roku CEO Anthony Wood, The Roku Channel&#8217;s catalog consists mainly of content that comes from the licensing deals Roku strikes with various partners.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xBVAezL73M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">Roku will launch original programming fueled by Quibi&#8217;s content on May 20</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Roku will launch original programming fueled by Quibi&#8217;s content on May 20&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/embed/#?secret=xBVAezL73M" data-secret="xBVAezL73M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a portfolio approach and the originals are part of that portfolio,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The primary source of content is still licensing, but originals have benefits, as well. And as part of the portfolio, they&#8217;re a great addition,&#8221; Wood added. He also was careful to explain that the addition of originals wouldn&#8217;t have any impact on the gross margins related to The Roku Channel&#8217;s ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) business model. Instead, the expansion into originals, which has also included Roku&#8217;s purchase of &#8220;This Old House,&#8221; is more about user acquisition and its ad business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other advantage of the originals is, of course, there&#8217;s a halo effect. So it&#8217;s helpful with the upfronts, it&#8217;s helpful with our advertising business and it&#8217;s helpful for bringing in new customers into The Roku Channel,&#8221; Wood said.</p>
<p>The company explained that originals drove more engagement among users, which then drove more advertisers &#8212; including new advertisers &#8212; and that gives Roku more money to invest in more content and further scale its business. Roku said that more than 42% of its advertisers were first-time upfront advertisers with the company, which had a lot do with its ability to offer original programming on The Roku Channel.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Roku saw a mixed Q2. The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/roku-q2-2021-earnings.html">beat Wall Street expectations</a> with earnings per share of $0.52 versus estimates of $0.13, and revenue of $645 million versus estimates of $618 million, but reported a decline in streaming hours. Roku said streaming hours decreased by 1 billion from the first quarter of 2021, but attributed this to the pandemic, as more people were leaving their homes for activities like dining, entertainment and travel. Shares fell by more than 8% after the earnings report, despite Roku reporting that streaming hours had grown year-over-year by 19% worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">December 2020 we covered</a> the launch of a new kind of smartphone app-based search engine, <a href="https://www.xayn.com/">Xayn</a>.</p>
<p>“A search engine?!” I hear you say? Well, yes, because despite the convenience of modern search engines’ ability to tailor their search results to the individual, this user-tracking comes at the expense of privacy. This mass surveillance might be what improves Google’s search engine and Facebook’s ad targeting, to name just two examples, but it’s not very good for our privacy.</p>
<p>Internet users are admittedly able to switch to the U.S.-based <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, or perhaps France’s <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, but what they gain in privacy, they often lose in user experience and the relevance of search results, through this lack of tailoring.</p>
<p>What Berlin-based Xayn has come up with is personalized, but a privacy-safe web search on smartphones, which replaces the cloud-based AI employed by Google et al. with the innate AI in-built into modern smartphones. The result is that no data about you is uploaded to Xayn’s servers.</p>
<p>And this approach is not just for &#8220;privacy freaks&#8221;. Businesses that need search but don’t need Google’s dominant market position are increasingly attracted by this model.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tROtDh42Xx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">Xayn is privacy-safe, personalized mobile web search powered by on-device AIs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Xayn is privacy-safe, personalized mobile web search powered by on-device AIs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/embed/#?secret=tROtDh42Xx" data-secret="tROtDh42Xx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the evidence comes today with the news that Xayn has now raised almost $12 million in Series A funding led by the Japanese investors Global Brain and KDDI (a Japanese telecommunications operator), with participation from previous backers, including the Earlybird VC in Berlin. Xayn’s total financing now comes to more than $23 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It would appear that Xayn’s fusion of a search engine, a discovery feed and a mobile browser has appealed to these Asian market players, particularly because Xayn can be built into OEM devices.</p>
<p>The result of the investment is that Xayn will now also focus on the Asian market, starting with Japan, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, co-founder and CEO of Xayn said: “We proved with Xayn that you can have it all: great results through personalization, privacy by design through advanced technology and a convenient user experience through clean design.”</p>
<p>He added: “In an industry in which selling data and delivering ads en masse are the norm, we choose to lead with privacy instead and put user satisfaction front and center.”</p>
<p>The funding comes as legislation such as the EU’s GDPR or California’s CCPA have both raised public awareness about personal data online.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Xayn says its app has been downloaded around 215,000 times worldwide, and a web version of its app is expected soon.</p>
<p>Over a call, Lundbæk expanded on the KDDI aspect of the fund-raising: “The partnership with KDDI means we will give users access to Xayn for free, while the corporate &#8212; such as KDDI &#8212; is the actual customer but gives our search engine away for free.”</p>
<p>The core features of Xayn include personalized search results; a personalized feed of the entire internet, which learns from their Tinder-like swipes, without collecting or sharing personal data; and an ad-free experience.</p>
<p>Naoki Kamimeada, partner at Global Brain Corporation said: “The market for private online search is growing, but Xayn is head and shoulders above everyone else because of the way they’re re-thinking how finding information online should be.”</p>
<p>Kazuhiko Chuman, head of KDDI Open Innovation Fund, said: “This European discovery engine uniquely combines efficient AI with a privacy-protecting focus and a smooth user experience. At KDDI, we’re constantly on the lookout for companies that can shape the future with their expertise and technology. That’s why it was a perfect match for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the three co-founders (Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, chief executive officer, Professor Michael Huth, chief research officer, and Felix Hahmann, chief operations officer), Dr Daniel von Heyl will come on board as chief financial officer. Frank Pepermans will take on the role of chief technology officer and Michael Briggs will join as chief growth officer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We should expect more of the same from the Chinese government: More complaints about the impact of "excessive" capital in its industries, more tumbling share prices and more held IPOs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chinese government&#8217;s crackdown on its domestic technology industry continues, with Tencent under fresh pressure despite the company&#8217;s efforts to follow changing regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>News broke over the weekend that Beijing filed a civil suit against Tencent &#8220;over claims its messaging-app WeChat&#8217;s Youth Mode does not comply with laws protecting minors,&#8221; <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/china-sues-tencent-over-wechat-105442861.html">per the BBC</a>. And NetEase, a major Chinese technology company, will delay the IPO of its music arm in Hong Kong. Why? Uncertain regulations, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cloud-village-ipo-idUSL4N2PG0LK">per Reuters</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>The latest spate of bad news for China&#8217;s technology industry follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">raft of regulatory changes</a> and actions by the nation&#8217;s government that have deleted an enormous quantity of equity value. After a period of relatively light-touch regulatory oversight, domestic Chinese technology companies have found themselves on defense after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) came after their market power in antitrust terms &#8212; and some of their business operations from other perspectives. Sectors hit the hardest include fintech and edtech.</p>
<p>Gaming is also in the CCP crosshairs.</p>

Tencent owns Riot Games, makers of the popular League of Legends title. NetEase generated $2.3 billion in gaming revenue out of total revenues of $3.1 billion <a href="https://netease.gcs-web.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2021/05/18/0-05-18/Q1%202021%20Earnings%20Release.pdf">in its most recent quarter</a>.</p>
<p>NetEase stock traded around $110 per share in late July. It&#8217;s now worth around $90 per share after expectations shifted in light of the gaming news, indicating that investors are concerned about its future performance. Tencent&#8217;s Hong Kong-listed stock has also fallen, from HK$775.50 to HK$461.60 this morning.</p>
<p>Tencent tried to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/03/chinas-tencent-tightens-controls-for-children-amid-games-addiction-fears?ref=biztoc.com&amp;curator=biztoc.com">head off regulatory pressure</a>, announcing changes to how it controls access to its games after the government&#8217;s shot across the bow. The effort doesn&#8217;t appear to have worked. That Tencent is being sued by the government despite its publicly announced changes implies that its proposed curbs to youth gaming were either insufficient or perhaps moot from the beginning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our Extra Crunch Live series continues with some heavy hitters in August, including Jen Nwankwo, founder and CEO at 1910 Genetics, and Playground Global general partner Jory Bell. They&#8217;ll be with us live on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-playground-global-and-1910-genetics">August 11 at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET)</a> to tell us all about how Nwankwo and her startup won over Bell and Playground as an investor, and as we do every week on Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll conduct a live pitch feedback session featuring you, the members of our audience.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live gives you the chance to hear live from entrepreneurs who have successfully raised significant rounds of venture capital &#8212; and from the investors who believed in them. We go into detail about how the deal got done, and you&#8217;ll hear from both about what it takes to pitch VCs and what industry-leading VCs look for in prospective portfolio companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have Nwankwo and Bell joining us for this episode. Nwankwo founded and leads 1910 Genetics, which takes advantage of AI to accelerate the discovery and development of new drug therapies across a wide range of disease and condition categories. She has a Ph.D. in pharmacology and experimental therapeutics from Tufts University School of Medicine and participated in drug discovery development that led to the creation of Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity prior to her graduate school work.</p>
<p>Bell&#8217;s career includes designing and building autonomous robots for deep-sea exploration, as well as a six-year stint at Apple designing notebooks for the consumer technology leader. Bell&#8217;s venture investment work began at Playground Global in 2015; he focuses on deep tech investments, including in aerospace, genomics, synthetic biology, and AI-assisted drug discovery, as in the case of 1910 Genetics.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually “raise their hand” to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Oleg Stavitsky and his co-founders started Endel, they didn&#8217;t necessarily expect for it to become a venture-backed business with the likes of Amazon&#8217;s Alexa Fund as investors. Stavitsky and his founding team describe themselves as a &#8220;collective of imaginative creatives and artists,&#8221; and the group had previously developed a unique set of apps for children called Bubl that were designed to foster creative development and avoid the usual tropes of character-based kid-focused entertainment.</p>
<p>Endel is a wholly different project, delivering personalized soundscapes to its users that help them achieve states of focus, relaxation and sleep. These are tailored specifically to individual users, and have more in common with meditative exercises and other wellness techniques than with traditional music. And the company has attracted a lot of big-name attention, including a partnership with Grimes that originated when she reached out because she loved using the app and wanted to see if they could work together.</p>
<p>Oleg talks to us all about his experience building Endel, and what it&#8217;s like being part of a highly unconventional founder collective building a consumer tech startup outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Oleg, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon and parent of its top Indian seller Cloudtail have decided to not continue their joint venture after May 2022, the two firms said in a statement Monday, hours after India’s top court ruled that the American e-commerce firm and Walmart’s Flipkart must face antitrust investigations in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran, the parent firm of Cloudtail, and Amazon launched the joint venture in the country in 2014. The joint venture restructured its ownership in 2019 following India’s regulatory changes &#8212; more on this shortly.</p>
<p>The development follows India’s Supreme Court ruling earlier in the day that Amazon and Flipkart must face antitrust investigations ordered against them in the country.</p>
<p>The Indian watchdog &#8212; the Competition Commission of India &#8212; ordered an investigation into the firms last year for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/"> allegedly promoting select sellers</a> (those in which they own a stake) on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the two firms said Cloudtail &#8212; registered as Prione Business Services &#8212; enabled over 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online and provided 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities. The joint venture, they said, helped merchants and small businesses access millions of customers in India.</p>
<p>Cloudtail is one of the largest sellers on Amazon in India. The e-commerce group has stakes in a few more third-party sellers, including Appario Retail, which is its joint venture with Patni Group.</p>
<p>“As our JV with Amazon reaches the end of its tenure, I reflect on this successful partnership that introduced the power of digitization and empowered hundreds of thousands of SMBs across big and small towns,” said M.D. Ranganath, president of Catamaran, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two firms did not say why they decided to end their joint venture.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have restricted Amazon and other e-commerce firms from holding inventory or selling items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole in late 2018</a> in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>In June this year, India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed even tougher e-commerce rules</a> that, among other things, prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly.</p>
<p>“Amazon and Catamaran entered into a JV in the early days of e-commerce in India with a shared vision of transforming hundreds of thousands of small businesses in a fast-changing digital world, by providing online capabilities enabling them to access customers both in India and globally,” said Amit Agarwal, Global Senior VP and country head of Amazon India, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canopy's leaders expect focused fintech products to win out over large bundles of services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://canopyservicing.com/">Canopy Servicing</a> announced this morning it recently closed a $15 million Series A. The startup sells software to fintechs and others, allowing customers to create loan programs and service the resulting products.</p>
<p>The company raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2020. Canaan led its Series A, with participation from Homebrew, Foundation and BoxGroup, among others. Per Canopy, its valuation grew by 5x from its seed round to its Series A.</p>
<p>The company has raised $18.5 million to date.</p>
<p>So far this reads much like any other post announcing a new startup funding round, kicking off with an array of information concerning the round and who chipped into the transaction. Next, we&#8217;d probably note the competitors, growth and what investors in the company in question have to say about their recent purchase. This morning, however, I want to riff a bit on the future of fintech and how the financial tech stack of the future may be built.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted with Canopy CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbivons">Matt Bivons</a> last week. He has an interesting take on where fintech is headed. Let&#8217;s discuss it and work through what Canopy does.</p>
<h2>Canopy</h2>
<p>As with many startups, Canopy was built to scratch an itch. Bivons had run into issues regarding loan servicing in prior jobs. He went on to found a startup that aimed to build a student credit card. But after working on that project, Bivons and co-founder Will Hanson pivoted the company to a B2B-focused concern building loan servicing technology.</p>
<p>Behind the decision was market research undertaken by the Canopy crew that uncovered that a great number of fintech startups wanted to get into the credit market. That makes sense; credit products can provide far more attractive economics to fintech startups than, say, checking and savings accounts. Knowing that loan servicing was a bear and a half to manage, Canopy decided to focus on it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bivons framed Canopy as a modern API for loan servicing that can be used to create and manage loans at any point in their lifecycle. He noted that what the startup is doing is akin to what several successful fintech companies have done, namely taking a piece of the fintech world and making it better for developers.</p>
<p>This is where Bivons&#8217; view of the future of fintech products comes into play. According to the CEO, in the future, companies will not buy a monolithic financial technology stack. Instead, he thinks, they will buy the best API for each slice of the fintech world that they need to implement. This matters because we could argue that Canopy is targeting too small a product space. Not that its market isn&#8217;t large &#8212; debt and its servicing are massive problem spaces &#8212; but seeing a company find a niche to focus on makes more sense when its leaders expect focused fintech products to win out over large bundles of services.</p>
<p>Bivons added that much of the fintech focus of the last five years has been on debit, citing Chime, Step and Greenlight as examples. The next decade, he said, is going to focus on credit products. That would be good news for Canopy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187219" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187219" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187219 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187219" class="wp-caption-text">Canopy co-founders via the company. CTO Will Hanson (left) and CEO Matt Bivons (right).</p></div></p>
<p>Critically, and for the finance nerds out there, Bivons told TechCrunch that its loan servicing technology does not require the company to take on any credit risk, and that it has gross margins of around 90%. I never trust a too-round number, but the figure indicates that what Canopy has built could grow into an attractive business.</p>
<p>Today, Canopy is a traditional SaaS, though Bivons said that it wants to move toward usage-based pricing in time. Its service costs around 50 cents per account per month, or around $6 per year in its current form. Today, around 40% of Canopy&#8217;s customers are seed and Series A-scale startups, though Bivons noted that it is moving up the customer size chart over time.</p>
<p>The resulting growth is impressive. Canopy&#8217;s customer count grew 4.5x from February to May of 2021. Of course, Canopy is a young company, so its overall customer base could not have been massive at the start of the year. Still, that&#8217;s the sort of growth that makes investors sit up and pay attention, making the Canopy Series A somewhat unsurprising.</p>
<p>Fintech growth doesn&#8217;t seem to be slackening much, meaning that the market for what Canopy is selling should expand. Provided that its view that best-of-breed, more particular fintech products will beat larger stacks in the market, it could have an interesting trajectory ahead of it. And now that it has raised its Series A, we can start to annoy it with more concrete questions about its growth from here on out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">James Evans, Richard Freling and Vinay Ayyala, co-founders at <a href="https://www.commandbar.com/">CommandBar</a>, were working on a software product when they hit a wall while trying to access certain functionalities within the software.</p>
<p>That’s when the lightbulb moment happened and, in 2020, the team shifted to building an embeddable search widget to make software easier to use.</p>
<p>“We thought this paradigm feels like it could be useful, but it is hard to build well, so we built it,” Evans told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Monday, CommandBar emerged from beta and announced its $4.8 million seed round, led by Thrive Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, BoxGroup and a group of angel investors including, AngelList’s Naval Ravikant, Worklife Ventures’ Brianne Kimmel, StitchFix president Mike Smith and others.</p>
<p>CommandBar’s business-to-business tool, referred to as “command k,” was designed to make software simpler and faster to use. The technology is a search interface that sits on top of web-based apps so that users can access functionalities by searching simple keywords. It can also be used to boost new users with recommended prompts like referrals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187043" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187043" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2187043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png" alt="" width="1024" height="660" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187043" class="wp-caption-text">CommandBar in Clubhouse. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CommandBar</p></div></p>
<p>Companies integrate CommandBar by pasting in a line of code and using configuration tools to quickly add commands relevant to their apps. The product was purposefully designed as low-code so that product and customer success teams can add configurations without relying on engineering support, Evans said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially, it was a difficult sell: One of the more challenging parts in the early days of the company was helping customers and investors understand what CommandBar was doing.</p>
<p>“It was hard to describe over the phone, we had to try to get people on Zoom so they could see it,” he said. “It is easier now to sell the product because they can see it being used in an app. That is where many new users come from.”</p>
<p>CommandBar is already being used by companies like Clubhouse.io, Canix and Stacker that are serving hundreds of thousands of users. The most common use case for CommandBar so far is onboarding new software users.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to grow the team, hiring across engineering, sales and marketing. The beta testing was successful in receiving good feedback from the early customers, and Evans wants to reflect that in new products and functionalities that will come out later this year.</p>
<p>Vince Hankes, an investor at Thrive Capital, was introduced to CommandBar through one of its pre-seed investors.</p>
<p>His interest is in B2B software companies and applications, and one of the things that became obvious to him while looking into the space was the natural tension between the simplicity and functionality of apps.</p>
<p>Apps are sometimes hard for even a power user to navigate, he said, but CommandBar makes something as simple as resetting a password easier by being able to search for that term and go right to that page if it is configured that way by the company.</p>
<p>“The types of companies interested in their product are impressive,” Hankes said. “We began to see demand from a broad range of companies that weren’t obvious. In fact, they are using CommandBar as a tool for deeper customer engagement.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Friends Alvaro Silberstein and Camilo Navarro came up with the idea for the Wheel the World travel booking site following a 2016 trip to Torres del Paine National Park in Chile.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Friends Alvaro Silberstein and Camilo Navarro came up with the idea for the <a href="https://gowheeltheworld.com/">Wheel the World</a> travel booking site following a 2016 trip to Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. Initially, they thought this type of trip would be near impossible with Silberstein in a wheelchair after a car accident as a teenager left him paralyzed.</p>
<p>Turns out it became the trip of a lifetime thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign to finance a scouting trip and the purchase of a state-of-the-art hiking wheelchair. Silberstein said with the help of Navarro and other friends, he became the first to complete the Patagonia trek by wheelchair.</p>
<p>Then in 2018 while in graduate school at UC Berkeley, they decided to launch Wheel the World so that others in similar situations as Silberstein could find accessible travel experiences.</p>
<p>Three years later, about 1,300 people have booked trips through the Berkeley, California-based company’s website, which offers over 400 listings to more than 50 destinations. On Monday, they announced $2 million in a seed round led by Chile Global Ventures and Dadneo, with the support of Plug N Play Tech Center and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki.</p>
<p>“We have a clear belief and purpose to make the world accessible,” Silberstein said.</p>
<p><div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2186933-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>Wheel the World collects over 200 data points on hotels through its Accessibility Mapping System, like hotel room measurements, and digitizes them to build its marketplace so that travelers can determine if that particular room will meet their needs. Users go on the site and build a profile, outlining their accessibility needs, and Wheel the World will recommend the best listings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also work with hotels and tours to attract this new segment of travelers and how to work with people who have disabilities, which Navarro said was 1 billion people globally, along with another large population of family and friends that would be involved in trips.</p>
<p>“Tapping into this market of disability travel will be tapping into more than $100 billion globally,” Silberstein added. Indeed, in 2018 and 2019, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/economic-impact-of-disability-travel-reaches-58-7-billion-301162417.html">travelers with disabilities took a total of 81 million trips</a>, spending $58.7 billion on their own travel alone, according to a 2020 report by Open Doors Organization, a nonprofit organization teaching businesses how to make their goods and services accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Silberstein and Navarro plan to use the new funding to build out Wheel the World’s software, make additional hires and add travel listings to the platform. Navarro expects to have over 3,000 listings by the end of 2022. The company has 23 employees today, and Silberstein is planning to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>Though the global pandemic was tough on the company, the founders said they used the time to design their system and think about their value proposition. It seems like the results paid off: The company recorded its best months ever for each of the last three months, Silberstein said.</p>
<p>“This year we are seeing travel inventory coming back, more people are vaccinated and we are pushing our inventory to grow more near where our users live so they can travel closer to home as well as far away,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in February 2019, Kroo, the London-based consumer-facing fintech, raised some seed funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/b-social-seed-2/">last year</a> for its prepaid card service which claims to offer more &#8220;social features&#8221; in its drive toward offering full-blown banking services. Kroo’s pitch is that it removes friction from financial interactions with friends and family, and throws in some environmental initiatives as well, such as tree planting.</p>
<p>It has now raised $24.5 million (£17.7 million) in a Series A funding round led by Rudy Karsan, a high-net-worth tech entrepreneur and founder of Karlani Capital. Kroo will use the funding in its drive toward a full banking license in early 2022.</p>
<p>The fundraising is fairly unusual for a fintech startup that aspires to become a bank, given the lack of an institutional investor. However, this will give it a lot more freedom as it heads toward bank status next year.</p>

<p>Kroo currently offers a prepaid debit card plus an app to track personal and social finances, such as the ability to create payment groups with friends, track spending and split and pay bills, removing the usual awkwardness around such things.</p>
<p>The company has also pledged to donate a percentage of profits to social causes, and launched a tree-planting referral scheme, so that every time a customer refers a friend, Kroo plants 20 trees.</p>

<p>CEO Andrea de Gottardo (pictured), who joined Kroo as chief risk officer in 2018, said: “We want to build the world’s greatest social bank: a bank dedicated to its customers and to the world we live in. We’re going to do more than just work with Kroo customers to improve their relationship with money and provide them with access to fair loans. We’re going to offer them ways to actively take part in making our world a better place, like carbon offsetting and a tree-planting referral program.”</p>
<p>Karsan said: “The reason I’m excited about Kroo is that it has a concrete opportunity to dramatically change the way people feel about their bank, for good. Kroo has an exceptionally talented management team and a nimble tech stack that will enable the continuous delivery of banking features customers really care about.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, de Gottardo added: “We have raised, including the Series A, over £30 million through high net worth individuals and syndicated investors. So we still haven&#8217;t done an institutional round. That was a choice.”</p>
<p>He elaborated: “We’re lucky enough to have Rudy Karsan, a high net worth, and an extremely supportive pool of investors that keep following on in the rounds. It was our intention get up to a Series A without any institutions, and to be free of the pressure from VC. It’s now highly likely we will go institutional for a Series B round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In-house legal teams play a critical role in companies, but a lot of them don’t have the same kind of technology as their counterparts in sales or finance. Instead, they often rely on email, shared inboxes and spreadsheets. <a href="https://lawvu.com/">LawVu</a> gives them a cloud-based platform to share legal advice and documents, communicate with each other or external counsel and create reports for the rest of the company, including the C-suite. “LawVu is to legal what Salesforce is to sales teams,” co-founder and chief strategy officer Tim Boyne told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The Tauranga, New Zealand-based company announced today that it has raised $17 million NZD (about $11.9 million USD) in Series A funding led by Insight Partners, the venture firm known for <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/categories/scale-up/">its ScaleUp program for growth-stage startups</a>, with participation from returning investor AirTree Ventures. Its previous funding was a seed round of about $1.8 million USD led by Shasta Ventures and AirTree, <a href="https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/2021/05/04/299583/legal-tech-startup-lawvu-closes-seed-round-led-shasta-and-airtree-ventures">announced in May</a>.</p>
<p>LawVu was founded in 2015 by Boyne, who spent over a decade working in IT and operations at law firms, and Sam Kidd, a SaaS project management expert. Since LawVu was designed for distributed teams and remote workers, adoption increased dramatically in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. LawVu’s annual recurring revenue tripled in 2020 and is continuing to grow. While it has users in 30 countries, about two-thirds of its recurring revenue now comes from the United States and Australia, with clients like Telstra, AMP, Linktree, Expedia, PwC and Instacart.</p>
<p>The company plans to hire key leadership roles in the U.S. for its global go-to-market strategy and open U.S. offices as it continues developing LawVu’s technology.</p>
<p>LawVu is used by in-house legal teams ranging from one person to more than 300. Its fastest adoption is coming from teams of five to 500 legal professionals.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canada&#8217;s newest unicorn: Clio raises $110M at a $1.6B valuation for legal tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/canadas-newest-unicorn-clio-raises-110m-at-a-1-6b-valuation-for-legal-tech/embed/#?secret=2hx25LkLXE" data-secret="2hx25LkLXE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup serves in-house legal teams, instead of law firms, because “in-house lawyers have very different incentives and objectives to their private practice peers. This creates a vastly different set of needs for in-house lawyers to be effective at their jobs, particularly on the technology front,” Boyne said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, private practice lawyers focus on specific projects, charging clients on time spent. In contrast, in-house lawyers have to balance “reactive work,” or what their company asks for, and “proactive work,” or anticipating the business’ needs and reducing risks.</p>
<p>LawVu’s cloud platform serves as a “legal workspace” that combines all the tech tools in-house legal teams need. For example, it lets them manage matter (or legal issues that can include advice requests, contract executions, M&amp;A transactions or litigation), contracts, documents, e-billing and outsourced work.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Legl gets $7M to help law firms upgrade to digital workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/legl-gets-7m-to-help-law-firms-upgrade-to-digital-workflows/embed/#?secret=Rk06DRM9cL" data-secret="Rk06DRM9cL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For in-house legal teams, LawVu&#8217;s analytics helps the rest of their company understand exactly what they do by providing metrics using data that is usually tucked away in email inboxes or a salesperson’s files, Boyne said.</p>
<p>“Legal work is largely invisible. Unlike other industries, legal is at the very beginning of its data journey,” Boyne said. He added, “as lawyers migrate their work into our workspace, everything is able to be captured as data. For the first time, the legal function now has the ability to see demand, types of work, team capacity, future hiring needs, what law firms are performing well, even process areas to automate with other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to helping in-house legal teams become more productive, LawVu also helps them prove their value to decision makers. Boyne explained that legal teams are often overlooked because they are viewed as cost centers which do not directly add to a company’s profit, and who come in at the end of a project or decision.</p>
<p>“Typically as a business scales really fast, the legal team can be left behind with the capacity to only fight fires and no time to engage and add much needed strategic value. If you don’t have the data to back up the value and work you are doing, it becomes very hard to get more resources when needed, be this tech or people,” Boyne said.</p>
<p>“LawVu workspace allows them to streamline their service, have information at their fingertips, deliver outcomes quickly, measure and demonstrate value, all freeing them up to truly become a valued member of the business leadership team.”</p>
<p>Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller will join LawVu’s board. In a statement, she said, “LawVu’s global growth speaks volumes to its future as a business and ability to provide high-value outcomes to legal teams. Its combination of intuitive user experience and excellent customer feedback make LawVu stand out in the legal tech industry.”</p>
