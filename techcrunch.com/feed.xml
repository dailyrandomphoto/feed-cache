										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Eric Tarczynski was first building Contrary Capital, he noticed that there was an absence of venture capital firms focused on entrepreneurs within universities. So, he launched a $2.2 million debut fund to exclusively back the world&#8217;s top talent, or the student entrepreneurs that are spinning out ambitious ideas out of their universities.</p>
<p>Years later, every investor wants to back founders earlier than their friends and foes. Contrary believes it has kept its competitive edge in backing early founders thanks to its secret: the firm has a community of 350 entrepreneurial students at colleges across the country that help it with deal flow. About 45% of the cohort identifies as female, and 65% identifies as non-white. It gives the firm the ability to learn about talented individuals before they even associate themselves with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of funds out there where most of what they do is basically swap deal flow,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve ever backed a company through any other way other than simply finding it and discovering it ourselves or through our community.”</p>
<p>65 investments later, Contrary Capital announced today that it has raised its second fund, a $20 million investment vehicle that will cut checks between $100,000 to $2 million to pre-seed founders. While the check size is bigger than Tarczynski initially estimated, the total fund is less than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/part-fund-part-accelerator-contrary-capital-invests-in-student-entrepreneurs/ ">Contrary’s original target of $35 million</a>, a move he said was done in a “deliberate, intentional, and methodical way” to grow the portfolio in a “slow and steady” way.</p>
<p>But, does slow and steady work in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">world of $500 million seed funds? </a></p>
<p>“We really don&#8217;t find ourselves competing,” he said. “Prices have definitely gone up in aggregate, for sure, but we&#8217;re not going toe to toe with those kinds of groups because we&#8217;re just swimming in a different pool.” Some could argue that reality is an argument for community-centric, community-first firms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ZEGI2GQRE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/what-a-community-means-in-the-modern-world-of-startups/">What a community means in the modern world of startups</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What a community means in the modern world of startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/what-a-community-means-in-the-modern-world-of-startups/embed/#?secret=4ZEGI2GQRE" data-secret="4ZEGI2GQRE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tarczynski’s ability to attract notable investors for his firm may show that he’s not alone in his vision. Investors in Contrary Capital include DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram, Facebook CPO Chris Cox, Github COO Erica Brescia, A16z GP Vineeta Agarwala and Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal.</p>
<p>The firm targets between 5 to 10% ownership in each deal it makes. Its track record of investments include Lightyear, Brightland, Aryeo, Chums, Anduril and Ramp.</p>
<p>“Contrary to our secret hiring weapon. They’ve built a remarkably unique firm, and are easily one of our most helpful partners,” said Karim Atiyeh, co-founder and CTO at Ramp, a fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">company recently valued at $3.9 billion.</a></p>
<h2>The next tech mafia</h2>
<p>Last year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/"> Contrary announced Contrary Talent</a>, a new arm within the fund that will invest and support early-career folks and students to grow their tech ambitions. Contrary Talent, which now has hundreds of members, sources the top engineers, designers and managers at top tech companies and pair them with top operators in tech for mentorship and job consultancy. It’s giving startup employees access to great minds before they have a pitch deck, or even know how to make one.</p>
<p>“As time went on and we spent more time on the ground at tech campuses, we realized not only were the number of young founders going up, but so were the number of top engineers, designers and product heads who were interested in working in tech,” Tarczynski said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/">when announcing Talent. </a></p>
<p>The arm will be a larger and larger part of Contrary Capital as time goes on, making it more of a venture franchise than a single vertical focus.</p>
<p>Even if the star employees don&#8217;t start their own funds, Talent is acquiring a database of some useful potential hires for their portfolio companies to poach. Tarczynski estimates that five out of the first 50 employees and interns at Ramp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">one of its unicorn portfolio companies</a>, had an affiliation with Contrary Capital.</p>
<p>Karim Atiyeh, co-founder and CTO at Ramp, described Contrary as their one of their most helpful partners, calling the firm their &#8220;secret hiring weapon.&#8221;</p>
<p>One bit that has changed for Contrary is that it is no longer doing Demo Days for founders that go through its summer accelerator program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that specifically in this environment, doing things in a programmatic and an annual fashion, is not the move,&#8221; the investor said. &#8220;I think the idea of telling founders that &#8216;oh, now is the time that you should raise for your company&#8217; when their timelines can be totally different, didn&#8217;t make much sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrary&#8217;s second close and expansion so far is clearly adding confidence to the eight-person team. SEC filings show that <a href="https://formds.com/issuers/contrary-capital-iii-l-p">Contrary Capital is already raising its third fund.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sureapp.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an insurance infrastructure startup, announced today that it has closed on $100 million in Series C funding at a $550 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Declaration Partners and European growth investor Kinnevik co-led the financing, which also included participation from WndrCo and existing backers W. R. Berkley and Menlo Ventures. The round brings the Santa Monica-based startup’s total raised to $123.1 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure launched its first (enterprise SaaS) product in early 2016, and today counts traditional financial services and fintech companies alike among its customers. Customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers Insurance, Chubb, Intuit, Betterment, Revolut, Carvana, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several automotive manufacturers and a leading global credit card network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All offer insurance programs built on Sure’s infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sure would not disclose hard revenue figures, it does claim to have been profitable since 2019. Also, CEO and co-founder Wayne Slavin says its annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown “by more than 3X every year over the past several years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Sure says it has created technology infrastructure that modernizes the entire insurance process and “allows it to be embedded into consumer experiences.” In other words, using Sure’s infrastructure, companies can sell insurance directly to consumers “in a matter of milliseconds,” the company claims, through an entirely digital experience that does not involve paper or humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is at the &#8220;forefront&#8221; of embedded insurance, according to Slavin.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That embedded insurance, he said, is “insurance that is integrated into the brand’s existing digital products across all industries,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can range from car insurance included in the online purchase of a new electric car or buying a used car on Carvana to purchasing business insurance when you start your company’s new bank account,” Slavin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of using its APIs allow companies to go to market with new insurance product offerings faster, simpler and cheaper compared to other methods, Slavin says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure differentiates in the three pillars that matter to our customers: tried and tested technology infrastructure, fastest speed to market, and the ability to offer fully embedded customer experiences,” Slavin told TechCrunch. “Like any legacy industry being disrupted there are many players trying to ride the wave of ‘embedded’ by rebranding their 1.0 experiences with a fancy new name. True embedded insurance experiences are unique and pioneered by Sure because they’re built from the ground up to fulfill an end-to-end transaction in the embedded channel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital from its growth round to accelerate its global expansion, speed up new product launches and continue to “streamline embedded insurance customer experiences.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International expansion will come in the form of new customers  &#8212; and offices &#8212;  in Europe, Latin America and Asia, as well as existing customers with successful domestic programs that plan to expand their insurance solutions to international customers, according to Slavin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure also plans to continue hiring. Sure’s current employee count is 80, which is up over 50% since last year. The company plans to triple its engineering headcount in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Stern, a partner at Declaration Partners, said his firm was drawn to Sure because of its view that Slavin is “a visionary leader” as well as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the massive global market for this transformational technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure is focused on the consumer experience, convenience and the power of embedding this capability into a consumer’s relationship with a brand,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinnevik’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ola Nordbye said a couple of her firm’s portfolio companies already use Sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We like how it enables better customer experiences at the same time as it unlocks a massive untapped profit pool for the brands that have already acquired their customer base,” she wrote via email. “One of the most difficult fintech spaces to get right when it comes to this is within insurance. We were impressed by Sure’s state-of-the-art tech platform, which is advanced far beyond what you would expect from a company at this stage, a founder with a crystal clear vision of what he wants to create combined with deep sector knowledge, and stellar financial KPIs such as growth and profitability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nordbye added that Sure is unique in how it enables new revenue streams on both ends of the equation (insurance companies as well as brands), and that they do that as a software play and without being a risk carrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that they can provide holistic offerings that can be delivered at incredible implementation speed is really unique as well,” she added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For more than 20 years, <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a> has been synonymous with quantum annealing. Its early bet on this technology allowed it to become the world&#8217;s first company to sell quantum computers, but that also somewhat limited the real-world problems its hardware could solve, given that quantum annealing works especially well for optimization problems like protein folding or route planning. But as the company announced at its <a href="https://www.qubits.com/schedule">Qubits</a> conference today, a superconducting gate-model quantum computer &#8212; of the kind IBM and others currently offer &#8212; is now also on its roadmap.</p>
<p>D-Wave believes the combination of annealing, gate-model quantum computing and classic machines is what its businesses&#8217; users will need to get the most value from this technology. &#8220;Like we did when we initially chose to pursue annealing, we’re looking ahead,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We’re anticipating what our customers need to drive practical business value, and we know error-corrected gate-model quantum systems with practical application value will be required for another important part of the quantum application market: simulating quantum systems. This is an application that’s particularly useful in fields like materials science and pharmaceutical research.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212202" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212202" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2212202" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?w=590" alt="" width="308" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png 2125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=130,150 130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=260,300 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=768,885 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=590,680 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=1332,1536 1332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=1776,2048 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dwave_advantage_system.png?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212202" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> D-Wave</p></div></p>
<p>Early on, the company argues, annealing provided the fastest path to building quantum applications. Today, about 250 D-Wave customers have built applications for its hardware, which virtually all of its users access through its Leap cloud service. And since there&#8217;s clearly value in quantum annealing, too, D-Wave won&#8217;t do away with it. &#8220;Annealing remains core to our roadmap,&#8221; the company says, and it plans to continue to invest and develop its current systems. Indeed, D-Wave believes that annealing &#8212; and the optimization use cases it enables &#8212; will account for about a third of the quantum application market.</p>
<p>But the company is also clearly aware that this is a major change in its strategy and that it has a bit of explaining to do. For years, after all, D-Wave argued that its annealing technology might one day be able to be used for a general quantum computer, too. Now, however, the company notes that since the technology and theory behind it has matured &#8212; and D-Wave itself has learned a lot about the materials engineering challenges involved &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8220;exactly the right time from a technical and theory perspective to face the challenges of gate-model implementation head-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>D-Wave is also quite open about the fact that this isn&#8217;t going to be a straightforward journey. After all, this is still quantum computing we are talking about. Given this, it&#8217;s not surprising that the company&#8217;s roadmap for its gate-model processor doesn&#8217;t feature any dates, but instead phases that range from building a first qubit (phase 1) to building a general-purpose quantum processing unit (QPU).</p>
<p>While the gate-model news is obviously the headline event today, D-Wave also made a few other announcements. It&#8217;s launching a performance update to its latest 5,000+ qubit Advantage-class machines today, for example, that promises to allow its users to solve larger and more complex problems. It&#8217;s also launching its <a href="https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/docs_dimod/reference/constrained.html">Constrained Quadratic Model</a> (CQM) solver today, which complements the existing range of solvers in D-Wave&#8217;s Leap service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for its overall roadmap, D-Wave expects to launch its latest Advantage machine with over 7,000 qubits &#8212; which will have a new design, too &#8212; and 20-way connectivity in a new topology, somewhere around 2023 or 2024, for example. And starting next year, it plans to launch new hybrid solvers that can solve mixed integer problems to help its users tackle more drug trial and chemical process optimization, logistics, scheduling and similar problems.</p>
<p>The real end-goal here, though, is to be able to offer a deeply integrated stack that offers its customers access to a set of hardware and software options that will allow them to tackle virtually any problem in quantum computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our full-stack approach to quantum technology, everything from chip fabrication to system development, and from hybrid software solvers to robust open source developer tools, means that we’re the only company in the world that can both deliver on regular product innovations and bring a cross-platform stack to market quickly. That’s practical,&#8221; said D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat is rolling out a new ‘Run for Office’ in-app tool to encourage young adults to run for local office. The company says the new Run for Office tool is designed to help younger users engage with democracy in an easy way. The goal of the tool is to tackle common barriers that young people face when determining whether they want to get involved in local politics.</p>
<p>“Powered with information from BallotReady, this simple tool will help Snapchatters explore hundreds of opportunities to run for local office based on the issues they care most about — from City Neighborhood Board and Township Council to School Board and State Representative,” the company said in <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/run-for-office">a statement.</a></p>
<p>The tool includes a centralized portal that curates over 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state and local levels that users may be eligible to take part in. Users will also be asked to identify issues that they are passionate about so that the tool can surface roles that they may be interested in. The new tool also provides access to candidate recruitment organizations and training programs such as Emerge America, Women’s Public Leadership Network, LGBTQ Victory, Vote Run Lead and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat users will also be able to nominate their friends to run for office through the tool. Users will be able to share stickers through the tool to start campaigning on Snapchat with their friends. Further, the tool includes a personalized campaign hub that shows users the steps they need to take to get on the ballot. The hub also provides information about filing deadlines and signature requirements.</p>
<p>“We know this next generation is the most diverse, yet currently only 6 percent of state legislators are under the age of 35. We hope our Run for Office initiative will help shape a more equitable, and reflective, democracy that includes all Americans, including young people,” the company said.</p>
<p>Snap says its app reaches 90 percent of 13-24 year olds in the U.S. and that this gives it an opportunity to encourage young users to become engaged citizens. Any Snapchat user in the U.S. can now access Run for Office by swiping down on the app’s camera screen or by searching for the tool within Snapchat.</p>
<p>The new tool isn’t the first time Snapchat has tried to get users involved in politics. During the U.S. election last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/register-to-vote-twitter-facebook-snapchat/">launched a voter-focused initiative</a> aimed at getting users registered to vote. The initiative featured a handful of celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Arnold Schwarzenegger and former President Barack Obama. Snapchat also rolled out a tool that prompted users to make a plan to vote with friends and request a mail-in ballot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is building a new facility at its Warren, Michigan, campus aimed at unlocking breakthrough cell technology that will drive down the cost of batteries while improving their range.</p>
<p>The automaker said Tuesday that the initial phase of the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, which will be about 300,000 square feet and located on the campus of GM&#8217;s Global Technical Center, is already under construction and is expected to be completed in mid-2022. The center is projected to expand at least three times its initial footprint as needed. GM did not reveal the cost of the build except to say &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of dollars were being invested.</p>
<p>The facility is named after Bill Wallace, a GM director who led the team that designed the battery systems in the Chevrolet Volt 1, Volt 2, Malibu Hybrid and Bolt EV. Wallace, who died in 2018, also pioneered GM&#8217;s relationship with LG Chem R&amp;D (now LG Energy Solution).</p>
<p>GM already has labs and an R&amp;D facility working on the development of cheaper and more energy-dense batteries. This new center is supposed to tie all of GM&#8217;s various efforts together, including work done at its chemical and materials subsystems and battery systems labs.</p>
<p>GM aims to develop batteries with an energy density of up to 1,200 watt-hours per liter and slash costs by at least 60%. The goal is ambitious — some might say lofty. It&#8217;s also viewed as a critical step for GM if it wants to compete with every other automaker, all of which have announced plans to shift to an all- or mostly electric vehicle portfolio.</p>
<p>Right now, the foundation of GM&#8217;s shift to EVs is its Ultium platform and Ultium lithium-ion batteries. That new electric architecture and battery system, which were revealed in 2020, will support a wide range of products across its brands, including compact cars, work trucks, large premium SUVs and performance vehicles.</p>
<p>GM has already announced plans to invest $5 billion into an Ultium cell battery manufacturing joint venture with LG Energy Solutions. The companies are establishing a battery cell assembly plant on a greenfield manufacturing site in the Lordstown area of Northeast Ohio that will create more than 1,100 new jobs and a factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Ultium batteries will use less of the rare earth material cobalt and feature a single common cell design that can be configured more efficiently for higher energy density and a smaller space than current GM batteries, the company has said.</p>
<p>The Wallace center will be a key part of GM&#8217;s plan to build cells that will be the basis of more affordable EVs with longer range in the future, according to Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain. These breakthroughs won&#8217;t show up in this coming generation of Ultium batteries.</p>
<p>Work at the Wallace Center is expected to speed up the development of new technologies, including lithium-metal, silicon and solid-state batteries. The center will also focus on improving production methods that can be used at battery cell manufacturing plants, including GM&#8217;s joint ventures with LG in Lordstown and Spring Hill and other undisclosed locations in the U.S., the company said.</p>
<p>Notably, the new facility will have the capacity to build large-format prototype lithium-metal battery cells for vehicle usage beyond the small-scale lithium-metal cells typically used in handheld devices or research applications. These cells could be as large as 1,000 mm, nearly twice the size of the initial Ultium pouch cells and will be based on GM&#8217;s proprietary formula, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the Nintendo Direct livestream a few weeks back, fans speculated that they might learn who the last remaining character in the extensive &#8220;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&#8221; lineup would be. Instead, we found out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">Chris Pratt will be playing Mario</a> in a feature film.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But today, in Nintendo&#8217;s final &#8220;Mr. Sakurai Presents&#8221; livestream, game director Masahiro Sakurai revealed that the last fighter to be added to &#8220;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&#8221; will be Sora from the &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; series. The &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; games, first released in 2002, feature characters from the Disney and Pixar universes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sora is the main character in the franchise, wielding a keyblade &#8212; but a small chain with a Mickey Mouse logo dangles from his weapon. Though Sora is a video game fan favorite, some might find it a little jarring to see a Mickey Mouse shape alongside characters like Mario and Pikachu. Sora comes with nine songs and a new stage, the Hollow Bastion, which is a castle from the &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This marks the 82nd playable character to be added to the beloved game, which was </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-is-good-clean-butt-kicking-fun/">released for Nintendo Switch</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in December 2018. But &#8220;Doom&#8221; fans can at least pretend to be &#8220;Doom Slayer&#8221; with a new Mii outfit &#8212; other Mii outfits include characters from &#8220;Splatoon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sakurai said in the livestream that six years ago, when &#8220;Super Smash Bros.&#8221; for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U posted a ballot asking fans to vote for which characters they wanted in &#8220;Smash,&#8221; the most requested new fighter was Sora. The game director added that Sora will be an easier character to play with, making the fighter suitable for beginners.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To use Sora, available on October 18, players can download the <a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/">Fighters Pass Vol. 2</a> expansion, which costs $29.99, but individual expansion characters can also be added to the game for $5.99. </span>Other characters in this expansion pack include Steve/Alex from &#8220;Minecraft,&#8221; Sephiroth from &#8220;Final Fantasy 7,&#8221; Pyra/Mythra from &#8220;Xenoblade Chronicles 2,&#8221; Kazuya Mishima from &#8220;Tekken,&#8221; and Min Min from &#8220;Arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward the end of the livestream, Sakurai announced that remastered versions of &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; games originally released for other consoles will become available for the Nintendo Switch. These include &#8220;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix, &#8220;Kingdom Hearts HD II.8 Final Chapter Prologue,&#8221; and &#8220;Kingdom Hearts III.&#8221; The release date for these games has not yet been announced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a deluge of new creator platforms, a startup called <a href="https://firesidechat.com/">Fireside</a> is launching today with what it believes will be a compelling proposition for professional creators in need of a more robust set of tools for content creation, distribution, measurement, and monetization. The service, which offers a platform for live and interactive shows, had been making waves during its beta period thanks to financial backing by Mark Cuban, who has also taken the rare step of naming himself as co-founder. He&#8217;s joined by former Googler, YouTuber, and Node co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/falon/">Falon Fatemi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/sugarcrm-acquires-node-to-gain-predictive-customer-intelligence/">who sold her last company to SugarCRM</a>, and early Yammer employee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ihbe/">Miek Ihbe.</a></p>
<p>The platform is now exiting its beta period, where it was tested with over 500 creators whose collective audience reach has topped 100 million, the company says.</p>
<p>While there had been some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse">early</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbbrandon/2021/02/15/mark-cuban-is-ready-to-completely-destroy-the-clubhouse-app/?sh=5d9aece772db">comparisons</a> between Fireside and <a href="https://musically.com/2021/02/09/startup-fireside-will-be-a-cross-between-podcasts-and-clubhouse/">live</a> <a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/here-is-what-upcoming-clubhouse-rival-fireside-may-look-like-71615094079474.html">audio</a> platforms like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, hosting live audio content is only a part of Fireside&#8217;s feature set. The company&#8217;s hesitance to speak about its plans pre-launch, however, allowed rumors to circulate to the point where many seemed to believe Fireside would be yet another Clubhouse clone.</p>
<p>The reality is that Fireside is offering a broader set of services.</p>
<p>The platform today offers the ability for creators to broadcast either live audio or video content, which can be simulcast to other social networks, streamed live in Fireside, recorded, saved, and edited for later distribution to other social platforms or podcast destinations, or viewed on-demand within Fireside itself. In other words, it&#8217;s attempting to combine everything that makes participating with live shows engaging with the need creators have to turn that content into something that has a longer life outside of the platform where it was originally hosted or recorded.</p>
<p>Along the way, Fireside also offers a slate of tools for promotion, editing, measurement, distribution, monetization, and audience growth. These aren&#8217;t meant to serve only as optional add-ons, but are part of Fireside&#8217;s end-to-end content production experience &#8212; an experience that creators today often manage today by using a multitude of single-purpose tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge to generating quality content is both identifying the best professional creators that can do that as well as attracting audiences. And the reality is the best professional creators are able to do both,&#8221; explains Fatemi, who serves as Fireside&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;The Holy Grail around understanding what makes quality content, or a hit, is understanding how audiences are reacting to it as they&#8217;re consuming it live. If you can understand this, you can not just engineer the hits &#8212; you can create the hits,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In Fireside, creators can choose whether they&#8217;re hosting live audio, live video, or a combination of both. Like other live platforms, Fireside includes the concept of a digital stage where co-hosts and guests can join the show and the audience react in the form of emojis &#8212; like clapping hands, thumbs up, hearts, laughter, and more. The show itself is automatically recorded in high fidelity and a copy is saved locally in case of network issues.</p>
<p>When the recording has wrapped, creators gain access to a transcript and the ability to edit the content before further distribution. In the editing interface, creators can cut out audio or video segments with a tap. This part is aided by how Fireside presents the data it recorded related to user sentiment and engagement. For example, if a portion of the show included negative sentiment or low engagement, a creator may choose to pull that piece out before distributing the show to other platforms. They can also edit the transcript text accordingly.</p>

<p>During a live show, the content can be simultaneously streamed to social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, or any platform offering a server URL or Stream Key, like <a href="https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040582051-Introduction-How-to-go-live-using-Vimeo">Vimeo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/128901/go-live-using-a-custom-stream-rtmp-?lang=en">LinkedIn Live</a>, and others. (Instagram is not supported as it doesn&#8217;t have an open API. But creators so far have been uploading their content as IGTV videos after the fact). When editing is completed, the show can also be distributed anywhere you can upload audio or video content, like social media platforms, podcast services, or RSS (for podcasts).</p>

<p>Creators can also monetize their audience directly on Fireside in addition to whatever revenue they&#8217;re generating externally on social platforms or through podcast subscriptions. At launch, Fireside aims to support subscriptions and ticketed events where creators set their own prices. It supports in-show advertising in partnership with <a href="https://libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It plans to support brand integrations, including gifting and tipping. It even supports NFTs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212500" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212500" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="665" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=680,665 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside</p></div></p>
<p>With tickets and subscriptions, Fireside only takes a 3% cut to cover its costs up until the creator makes $30,000 in revenue. It then takes 15% &#8212; a decision the company made after analyzing the state of the market and speaking to creators about what they felt was fair.</p>
<p>With NFTs, it plans to allow creators to clip a moment of their show as an NFT and then distribute it to other NFT marketplaces in a few taps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think NFTs are a really powerful vehicle for allowing creators to turn their content into currency,&#8221; notes Fatemi, adding that NFTs are a part of &#8220;the future of entertainment,&#8221; in the company&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212498" style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212498" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2212498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?w=462" alt="" width="333" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg 474w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=102,150 102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=204,300 204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=462,680 462w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212498" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside</p></div></p>
<p>But Fireside, which had been hesitant to talk about its product pre-launch, is still saving some details for a later date. Currently, that includes which specific NFT partners it plans to work with on this feature &#8212; one of the bigger differentiators between its platform and other creator tools in its same space.</p>
<p>The company is also unwilling to detail the state of outside investment in its business, though already it&#8217;s been established that Cuban has taken a role as both co-founder and investor, and that Fireside was apparently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601191/fireside-app-mark-cuban-falon-fatemi-libsyn-rode-invest">soliciting investment earlier this summer.</a></p>
<p>Cuban&#8217;s role as co-founder is not typical for the entrepreneur turned investor, Shark Tank star, and Dallas Mavericks owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s incredibly involved,&#8221; touts Fatemi. (Though not so involved as to join a press interview, we should note!) She says Cuban has been offering Fireside great guidance, particularly from the product side of things. &#8220;He is an example of someone who&#8217;s built a new media empire by themselves. So he deeply understands the challenges that professional creators are facing,&#8221; Fatemi adds.</p>
<p>The company is in the process of closing on its Series A, which is why it won&#8217;t talk about its backers for the time being.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212499" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212499" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212499" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?w=650" alt="" width="650" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg 854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=287,300 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=768,804 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=650,680 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212499" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside (brand activations example)</p></div></p>
<p>Though now officially launched, Fireside isn&#8217;t necessarily wide open to anyone. The creators it&#8217;s choosing to onboard must be professionals, even if they&#8217;re still in the early days of growing their fandom. So far, the company has been working with creators including Michael Dell, who&#8217;s launching a new book; true-crime podcaster Robert Riggs; the cast and creator of &#8220;Entourage;&#8221; comedians from the Laugh Factory; author and research Daniel Pink; and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at [whether they have] invested in their brand and their community. Are they actually content creators&#8230;is this what they&#8217;re wanting to do full-time?,&#8221; explains Fatemi. There&#8217;s no requirement to have a certain number of existing fans, she notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s more about where they are at in their journey and how serious they are in building a media business.&#8221;</p>
<p>This focus on pre-vetted professional creators and domain experts, the company believes, may help it to cut down on some of the content moderation issues facing live streaming tools used by the general public. But since <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/26/joe-rogan/spotifys-joe-rogan-repeats-inaccurate-claim-they-a/">even professionals can spread misinformation</a>, Fireside will still need to decide where it stands as a platform in terms of the content it, itself, chooses to host.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of our approach, we haven&#8217;t seen many challenges,&#8221; Fatemi says, of these sorts of broader culture-setting decisions it will ultimately need to make. &#8220;But obviously, as we start to open the platform up more, we need to be very thoughtful about this,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Fireside is available on the web and mobile, on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fireside/id1526340798">iOS</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hotglue.xyz/">Hotglue</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to connect to business applications like Salesforce, announced a $1.5 million seed today led by Uncommon Capital and a group of angels. The company is the brainchild of a couple of 20 year old founders, CEO Hassan Syyid and CRO David Molot, who dropped out of the University of Maryland last year to build their startup.</p>
<p>Syyid explained that the idea that caused them to shift their life plans is a product for developers that makes it easier to build integrations with business apps like Salesforce, QuickBooks and HubSpot. Today the pair has built 250 such connectors based on the open source project<a href="https://meltano.com/"> Meltano</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer and you want to build a product that serves businesses, you generally have to access that data from wherever it lives. And so whether that is a Salesforce account or QuickBooks account, accessing the data can have a lot of challenges, and so we make it easier by giving you an embeddable way to solve that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While using connectors to access data on business systems isn&#8217;t necessarily a new idea, Syyid says that their focus on developers is different. &#8220;I think traditionally if you think about products in the data [integration market], you&#8217;re thinking about FiveTran or Stitch because they can help consolidate your company&#8217;s internal data into a data warehouse. The difference here is that our users are actually engineering teams,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Syyid came up with the idea for the company while interning at an accounting startup where he saw the company&#8217;s customers struggling to access Quickbooks data and deal with issues like exceeding the number of calls allowed for the API. So he built a connector to handle all of that.</p>

<p>At this point, he connected with his friend Molot and the two decided to drop out of school to pursue their idea full time. While their parents were worried about their decision, they initially accepted the idea of taking a semester off to work on building the company. They each moved home and went to work. Getting into the Y Combinator Summer 21 cohort helped convince their parents that they were onto something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We took a gap semester technically initially, and then we got into Y Combinator and then our parents were like &#8216;okay maybe this is legitimate&#8217;, and that kind of gave them the vote of confidence to allow us to pursue this,&#8221; Molot said.</p>
<p>At YC, they learned about building a business and listening to customers and building connectors that solved the problems their target developer audience was facing as they tried to build these integrations themselves. It also prepared them to build a business and revenue engine to start selling the product, knowledge that they have continued to build on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have spent a lot of time reading and building our knowledge base internally and making sure that we&#8217;re always on point using knowledge tools that have helped us understand these business metrics and ideas,&#8221; Molot said.</p>
<p>They also began writing content early on, publishing about the nature of the data integration <a href="https://hotglue.medium.com/">on Medium</a>, and this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-used-an-embedded-etl-tool-for-my-b2b-app-56d0b3d8ac6?source=user_profile---------14----------------------------">content marketing approach</a> helped them get their name out there and further refine the problem as they built their products.</p>
<p>Today they have around 15 customers with a similar number in the pipeline. They are generating revenue and growing the active user base by 50% month over month. With the seed investment, they hope to hire a couple of engineers and continue building the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has been ordered to pay $137 million in damages to a Black former worker who accused the company of turning a blind eye to discrimination and racial abuse at the company&#8217;s EV plant in Fremont California, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/tesla-racism-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Washington Post</em></a> has reported. A San Francisco federal court jury awarded the judgement — reportedly one of the largest in an individual race discrimination employment case — to Owen Diaz, an elevator operator who worked as a contract employee in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, Diaz alleged that he faced discrimination &#8220;straight from the Jim Crow era,&#8221; in which he was subjected to racial slurs. He alleged that Tesla employees left drawings of swastikas, racist graffiti and offensive cartoons around the plant, while supervisors neglected to halt the abuse. &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s progressive image was a façade papering over its regressive, demeaning treatment of African-American employees,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The jury awarded Diaz $6.9 million for emotional distress, but the majority, $130 million, was punitive damages against Tesla. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing when one of the richest corporations in America has to have a reckoning of the abhorrent conditions at its factory for Black people,&#8221; said the lawyer for Diaz, Lawrence Organ.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took four long years to get to this point,” Diaz told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/tesla-racism-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>New York Times</em></a>. “It’s like a big weight has been pulled off my shoulders.”</p>
<p>In response to the verdict, Tesla downplayed the allegations in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/regarding-todays-jury-verdict" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">blog post</a>written by human resources VP Valerie Capers Workman. &#8220;In addition to Mr. Diaz, three other witnesses (all non-Tesla contract employees) testified at trial that they regularly heard racial slurs (including the N-word) on the Fremont factory floor,” she wrote. “While they all agreed that the use of the N-word was not appropriate in the workplace, they also agreed that most of the time they thought the language was used in a ‘friendly’ manner and usually by African-American colleagues.”</p>
<p>Tesla added that it was responsive to Mr. Diaz&#8217;s complaints, firing two contractors and suspending another. She said that while the facts didn&#8217;t justify the verdict, the company was &#8220;not perfect&#8221; in 2015 and 2016, &#8220;but we have come a long way.&#8221; The company has yet to say whether it plans to appeal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile’s </span><a href="https://www.buk.cl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed a human resources management platform for Latin American companies, announced today that it has raised $50 million in a Series A funding round that values the company at $417 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few notable things about this financing. For one, it represents one of the largest (if not the) largest Series A rounds raised by a Latin American startup to date. Secondly, it makes Buk the third most valuable startup in Chile after Cornershop and NotCo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Brazil and increasingly as of late Mexico, have received the bulk of venture dollars from venture investors. But more and more, other regions in Latin America such as Chile are also attracting global investor interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also of note is that Buk was bootstrapped for the first five years of its SaaS operations. Its first institutional investors include San Francisco-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based Greenoaks, which led the Series A round, and SoftBank. Interestingly, a group of founders from unicorns such as Rappi, Kavak, Konfio, GBM, Ualá and Brex also put money in the round.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=Tkm4KOyK1m" data-secret="Tkm4KOyK1m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by Chileans Jaime Arrieta, Santiago Lira, Teresita Morán, Felipe Sateler and Ricardo Sateler, Buk is building a cloud-based platform that it says allows companies to manage their human resources </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end to end” &#8212; from the payment of salaries to professional development. Buk also includes tools like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">company climate surveys, performance evaluations, recruitment modules and attendance monitoring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the mission to &#8220;build a happier workplace&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk CEO Jaime Arrieta said the company has been growing organically, and has historically been financing its growth with revenues from its sales. While Arrieta declined to reveal hard revenue figures, he told TechCrunch that Buk saw its annual recurring revenue (ARR) increase by 151% in September compared to September of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been able to double our size year over year [without institutional funding],” he said. “However, our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">excellent results, differentiated offering, and the comprehensiveness of our product, which distinguishes us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from competitors, attracted funds like Greenoaks and SoftBank, who wanted to invest in Buk to boost our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Buk has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 4,000 clients that hail from a variety of industries in Latin America, including educational institutions, investment banks, fast food chains, law firms and others.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It powers payroll for over 400,000 employees of Buk customers every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk’s infrastructure is hosted on AWS servers, which means it is able to access multiple tools across its technological ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">performs daily backups of its customers&#8217; information, allowing it to keep the service running even in the event of third-party data failures. Buk says it also offers a “friendly” programming language that has many facilities &#8220;to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly develop functionalities.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212493" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212493" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2212493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sin-título-7506-e1633436896228.jpg" alt="Buk Series A" width="2000" height="1334" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Buk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk also has a social good component. As the COVID-19 pandemic raged last year, the company launched Buk Starter, a free digital remuneration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool for companies with up to 20 employees. Today, the tool is used by 4,000 SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to accelerate its growth in Mexico, consolidate the market in Colombia and Peru (Where it expanded in 2019 and 2020), double down on technology and product development and toward the acquisition of new companies at the regional level. Buk recently acquired CTRL, an assistance company in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several years, the company also aims to increase its market share in each of the countries where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it operates. In September alone, Buk says it grew 7% in Chile, 20% in Colombia, and 23% in Peru month-over-month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk has more than 300 employees, and says that 50% of the company’s workforce are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks has previously also backed the likes of Kavak, Discord, Robinhood, Stripe, Rippling and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toast. SoftBank has backed companies like Slack, Uber, Rappi, Alibaba, Didi, Flipkart and Bytedance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HR software is the core source of truth for a company&#8217;s employee data, underpinning critical functions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like payroll, benefits, and people management,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil Mehta, founder and partner at Greenoaks, in a written statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until now, businesses in Latin America have relied </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily on homegrown solutions that don’t scale or imported software that&#8217;s poorly tailored to local </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs. Buk is building an HRIS suite made in and for Latin America, enabling more efficient workflows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">throughout the full employee lifecycle, from recruiting to off-boarding. We think the company is poised to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> build the region&#8217;s #1 HR technology platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/yubico/">Yubico</a>, the maker of hardware security keys, has unveiled the YubiKey Bio, its first key to support biometric authentication for passwordless logins and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (2FA)</p>
<p>The launch of the YubiKey Bio comes as tech giants transition away from traditional password-based logins, a prime target for cyberattacks. Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/microsoft-now-lets-you-sign-in-without-your-password/">recently rolled out a passwordless sign-in option</a> to all consumer accounts, and Google this year <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/">announced plans to eventually eliminate the password</a>.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio — first teased almost two years ago at Microsoft Ignite in November 2019 — jumps on the passwordless bandwagon by embedding a built-in fingerprint reader to the key. Yubico describes this as the “next logical step” for the company, particularly as most modern laptops still don’t feature built-in biometric security.</p>
<p>Once a fingerprint is enrolled on the device, the data is stored in a secure element, while the biometric subsystem runs independently of the key’s core security functionality. All communication between the secure element and the rest of the key is encrypted to help thwart replay attacks.</p>
<p>“With the launch of the YubiKey Bio Series, we are proud to raise the standard for biometric security keys, enabling simple and strong passwordless authentication for our enterprise customers and everyday YubiKey users,” said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/fireside-chat-with-stina-ehrensvard-yubico-disrupt-berlin-2018/">Stina Ehrensvärd</a>, CEO and co-founder of Yubico.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211790" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211790" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211790" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?w=680" alt="YubiKey Bio" width="900" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=2048,1510 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211790" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey Bio (Image: Yubico/supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>The company also notes that while no security system is foolproof, a hacker with a fake print would need to get their hands on the user’s physical device to take advantage of that print, which dramatically reduces the threat to the average YubiKey customer. Yubico will allow users to use their PINs to login in case biometric authentication does not work due to variables in skin texture related to moisture or temperature.</p>
<p>Like Yubico&#8217;s other hardware security keys, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/yubico-reveals-new-yubikey/">such as the YubiKey 5C NFC</a>, the YubiKey Bio is a plug-and-play device; it doesn&#8217;t require any batteries, drivers, or associated software, and it will work across macOS, Windows and Linux machines. YubiKeys also support open security and authentication standards — FIDO U2F, FIDO2, and WebAuthn protocols — so they work on Macs, iPhones, Windows PCs, and Android devices, as well as apps and services that support FIDO protocols out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio is out now in both USB-A ($80) and USB-C ($85) versions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise is expanding its remote controlled delivery robots to convenience store chains across the U.S. through a new two-year strategic partnership with King Retail Solutions (KRS), an Idaho-based retail brand strategy company with a national footprint. Under the agreement, KRS will resell and distribute more than 500 of Tortoise’s sidewalk delivery vehicles to help its convenience store customers offer affordable, same-day last-mile delivery options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent partnerships with</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last-mile logistics supplier AxelHire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grocery chain Shoprite and convenience store brand Choice Market demonstrate a major shift toward robotic delivery for Tortoise, one that allows it to bring its robots into an increasing range of markets. The company was initially founded in 2019 to remotely rebalance shared scooters into parking bays or toward demand, but the drop in micromobility usage during the pandemic caused Tortoise to pivot aggressively to delivery, an industry that only continues to grow as more customers expect their goodies to arrive within hours of ordering. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AxleHire to scale Tortoise and URB-E zero-emissions delivery solutions nationally&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/embed/#?secret=MLBsmDuFkc" data-secret="MLBsmDuFkc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody’s waking up to this new reality that same-day is the new normal, and it’s just not sustainable on every possible front to have that consumer expectation be met with people making $20 an hour doing those deliveries,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, CEO and founder of Tortoise. “The math just doesn’t work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially when the cost of delivery is offloaded onto the customer. Whole Foods Market online shoppers in six metropolitan markets </span><a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/whole-foods-go-chainwide-new-grocery-delivery-fee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will soon be charged $9.95</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for same-day delivery, a perk that used to come free from parent company Amazon’s Prime membership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, for the average grocery CEO, e-commerce was maybe the eighth thing on their priority list,” said Shevelenko. “Right now, it’s number one for everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience store delivery is becoming a growing sector alongside the on-demand food and grocery delivery markets. Between the first and last weeks of 2020, convenience store online spending grew 346%, according to a </span><a href="https://trends.edison.tech/research/convenience-store-delivery-sales.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by Edison Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer insights analytics company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KRS offers convenience chain customers a range of solutions, from convenience store management and self checkout POS to app development, business intelligence and omnichannel ordering. The company will buy Tortoise’s delivery robots outright at a cost of around $5,000 each. It will then lease units to customers, most likely as a bundled purchase with other services. Tortoise and its several dozen-strong army of independent contractors will still be the ones driving the robot routes and charging a monthly fee based on miles driven. </span></p>
<p>Tortoise&#8217;s vehicles are best for deliveries that are no more than three miles from the store, based on battery life, but can handle five-mile deliveries in a pinch. If a retailer does at least three deliveries of this length per day, they could easily pay back the cost of the monthly lease, <span style="font-weight: 400;">especially if they factor in the marketing benefit of a branded robot spreading the word about a store’s offerings, said Shevelenko. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The robots move at an average speed of four miles per hour, which means they can reach a delivery destination 1 mile away in less than 20 minutes, and can complete about eight to 10 deliveries during normal delivery hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise supplies retail customers with flexible APIs and web portals so retailers can customize the ordering experience. Consumers hankering for a bag of Doritos and a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry’s from their local convenience store usually won’t be given the option at the point of sale of choosing robotic delivery. Instead, after making the purchase, the consumer will get a text asking them if they’d like their treats delivered via robot. If they reply affirmatively, they&#8217;d get text updates or updates in the retailer’s app as the robot’s on its way. A unique link sent via SMS unlocks the container, and prerecorded messages on the robot itself will let the customer know when it’s been unlocked so they can access their goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of Tortoise’s business model is that it’s flexible enough to serve multiple different use cases, from urban to exurban, last-mile to middle-mile delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The logic of our system is all the same; you&#8217;re just telling us which robot and where to drive it to,” said Shevelenko. “We actually love these types of opportunities working with a platform customer that can get us into a lot of different types of communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more communities Tortoise can place its delivery robots in, the faster it can achieve its longer-term goal of truly autonomous delivery robots. Characteristic of all its deployments is a strategy of being in markets before they start to allow commercial autonomous vehicles so that Tortoise is there already when those markets inevitably do legalize self-driving vehicles. Meanwhile, access to different use cases allows Tortoise to continuously collect data it will need to train its AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need A LOT of local routing data to do autonomy, and teleops is the most effective way to aggregate it,” said Shevelenko. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[ModernLoop automates many of the repetitive tasks recruiters do while also scheduling and balancing the interviewing workload so the right mix of people are involved and trained.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anyone looking for a job, even in the past decade, knows how difficult it can be or has been — applications going into a black hole of a CRM, no response and follow-ups or the process being drug out for months.</p>
<p>Lydia Han and Christopher Triolo started <a href="https://www.modernloop.io/">ModernLoop</a> in December 2020 after seeing the problem of technical recruiting firsthand. Han, who was a product manager at Slack, also worked at Brex the same time that her sister was a technical recruiter there and heard about the pain points. Meanwhile, Triolo came up with the idea for the “charitable donations” platform on Facebook. They saw recruitment as an industry that needed products and technology to work together to provide better user experiences.</p>
<p>“Once you get a candidate in the pipeline, you have to convince them to take the job,” CEO Han told TechCrunch. “This process is the first impression someone has of the company, so you have to move them along in the process, put them in front of the right interviewers and be prepared to deliver on the experience.”</p>
<p>Recruiters have traditionally kept track of the hiring process manually with spreadsheets, but ModernLoop automates many of the repetitive tasks while also scheduling and balancing the interviewing workload so that not only are the right people involved, but also a diverse mix of interviewers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2211838" style="width: 2570px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211838" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211838 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png" alt="ModernLoop" width="2560" height="1720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=1536,1032 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=2048,1376 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211838" class="wp-caption-text">ModernLoop dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> ModernLoop</p></div></p>
<p>The platform also trains interviewers with a shadowing experience and facilitates communication and coordination via Slack so people on the company and candidate side have all of the information needed for the interview.</p>
<p>ModernLoop was part of the Y Combinator Winter 2021 cohort and announced it raised $3.3 million in funding, led by Accel, that included Webb Investment Network, some of Han’s former leaders at Brex and a Zoom product lead.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor statistics estimate there is already a <a href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#The%20US%20Tech%20Talent%20Shortage%20Statistics%20in%202020">global talent labor shortage of 40 million workers</a>, and that number will grow to over 85 million by 2030. The hiring sector is continuing to attract entrepreneurs who honed their skills in big tech and now want to solve this problem.</p>
<p>ModernLoop’s approach is one of the latest to receive investor attention. For example, in the past month, recruiting platform Gem <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/recruiting-platform-gem-gains-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise-to-change-the-way-companies-hire/">raised $100 million</a> to value the company at over $1 billion. Its co-founders are from Dropbox and Facebook. CodeSignal, specializing in technical assessment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/codesignal-secures-50m-for-its-tech-hiring-platform/">brought in $50 million</a> — one of its co-founders is from Google.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Recruiting platform Gem gains unicorn status with $100M raise to change the way companies hire&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/recruiting-platform-gem-gains-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise-to-change-the-way-companies-hire/embed/#?secret=md7J7qMEsk" data-secret="md7J7qMEsk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amit Kumar, principal at Accel, also saw the hiring process up close when he was part of the hiring committee while at Twitter. Teams would interview candidates, aggregate the data and provide it to the people making the ultimate decisions.</p>
<p>He says recruiting operations is difficult enough, but the process became much more complicated during the global pandemic. ModernLoop has “real authenticity with the space, the scrappiness and an early response that was resounding.”</p>
<p>“I admired Lydia and encouraged her to start a company and pursue entrepreneurship,” he said. “No one has shown love to recruiting operations folks. I haven&#8217;t seen before the kind of early response she was getting with customers, and we were closing 80% of conversations with a bare-bones product.”</p>
<p>In fact, early on, Han reverse-emailed some of the recruiters who had reached out to her for positions to talk to them about the idea of ModernLoop and inquire if they would be interested in the product.</p>
<p>ModernLoop’s customer list now includes Benchling, Chainalysis, Ramp, Primer.ai and VSCO. In particular, since Chainalysis started working with ModernLoop in March, the company grew from 200 to over 300 employees, Han said.</p>
<p>Now that the company has a product and paying customers, the new funding will go toward building up a team of engineers and expanding the customer base.</p>
<p>“We ourselves were founded in the heart of the pandemic, and with companies going remote and staying remote, the interviewing experience also needs to be remote,” Han said. “Also, the better trained your interviewers are, the better your company will be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest Surface Pro is packed with new goodness. The screen is new and the chassis is new. It runs the latest Intel chipset and finally supports Thunderbolt 4. The Surface Pro 8 even packs Windows 11, which brings a host of new features. The signature kickstand works better, and the optional keyboard is improved. The only thing missing is the MicroSDXC slot, which didn&#8217;t make the cut for this version.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is a major update from previous models, and yet it&#8217;s still familiar. Microsoft finally updated the exterior of the Surface Pro, and it was about time. The company introduced the Surface Pro in 2013 and the casing had hardly changed through seven generations of products. For the Surface Pro 8, Microsoft utilized the wonderful body of the Surface Pro X, which it introduced in 2020. And it&#8217;s fantastic. The Surface Pro 8 is better than ever.</p>
<p>I have no reservations saying this: The Surface Pro 8 is the best 2-in-1 yet. I love it. The portable is a joy to use and a great solution for those looking for a convertible Windows machine.</p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is impressive. Pop open the Kickstand and Windows 11 springs to life. There&#8217;s hardly a delay. Everything is snappy to load and respond. From Lightroom to Factorio, the Surface Pro 8 is fast with its 11the gen Intel Core CPUs.</p>
<p>The screen is lovely and among the best I&#8217;ve seen in a mobile device. Sadly, not all buyers will experience the best of this screen as Windows buries the 120hz option deep in the Control Panel. I cannot report on HDR support; I couldn&#8217;t get it to work.</p>
<p>Windows seems like the weak link with the Surface Pro 8. Even in this new Windows 11 form, the operating system remains one of the Surface Pro&#8217;s downsides. Windows 11 has some odd, seemingly anti-user quirks that I&#8217;ve been slow to normalize. I&#8217;m not too fond of the new start menu, and all mobile-first functions like widgets are haphazardly added.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 runs the latest Intel chips inside the lovely anodized aluminum case of the Surface Pro X released in 2020. Thanks to the new chassis, fingerprints no longer stick to the surface. Edges are rounded, and it&#8217;s a more refined hardware experience than past models. It&#8217;s is thicker and heavier than its predecessor by 2mm and 100 grams. When asked why a Microsoft representative responded, saying the company feels the upgraded cooling and larger battery are worth the slightly thicker build.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 packs the best screen in any portable. The screen is impressive in both picture quality and touchscreen capabilities. It&#8217;s bright and crisp, dense with pixels and clarity. The screen has a refresh rate of 120 Hz, though users must activate this feature in an advanced menu under Display settings. It&#8217;s supposed to support HDR, too, though that feature doesn&#8217;t seem available at the time of testing. The screen now supports adaptive color adjusting. The Surface Pro 8 slyly adjusts the color temperature to match ambient light.</p>
<p>The 11.3-inch screen has a resolution of 2880 x 1920 with 267 pixels per inch (PPI). For comparison, the latest iPad Pro sports an 11-inch screen that runs at 2388 x 1668 at 264 PPI.</p>
<p>The screen is a big part of the draw to this new surface Pro. It&#8217;s lovely and makes everything from Slack to Photoshop shine anew.</p>
<p>Using the touchscreen is seemingly better, too. The new screen (or maybe Windows 11) feels more smooth when using a stylus or finger. In addition, it&#8217;s a joy to touch the screen &#8212; I know that sounds over-the-top, but that&#8217;s how I feel.</p>
<p>Microsoft released a new version of the Surface Slim Pen. This second version features a redesigned tip and reduced latency along with haptic feedback. The Slim Pen 2 is fun: It can provide tactical feedback as different types of brushes. Using a brush feels different than using a smudging stump. When a pencil is selected, the Slim Pen 2 returns a scraping sensation. The applications have to support this feature (and a few do now), but the result is radically different from past experiences.</p>
<p>And the Surface Slim Pen 2 hides and charges in a clever spot on the keyboard hinge. But again, this isn&#8217;t a new feature to the Surface line. Microsoft debuted this with the Surface Pro X in 2020.</p>
<p>Inside, an 11th generation Intel Chip powers the Surface Pro 2, and the active cooling keeps the performance stable. This time around, the Surface Pro doesn&#8217;t seem to scale performance as aggressively as past models.</p>
<p>My test machine is a Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It uses Intel&#8217;s Iris X Graphics. This machine retails for $1,599 plus the cost of the keyboard (bundled with or without the Surface Slim Pen 2). This model is the least expensive option with the Core i7 CPU. Spend more money, and you&#8217;ll get a Surface with more storage and RAM. Price continues to climb to $2,599, which features 32GB of RAM with a 1TB SSD.</p>
<p>Gone are the USB-A ports of old. Instead, Microsoft finally brought USB-C to the Surface Pro line, and they&#8217;re the latest Thunderbolt 4 flavor. In this configuration, the Surface Pro 8 can power multiple 4k displays, connect to an external GPU, or use a host of other data-intensive accessories. The USB-C ports can also recharge the Surface Pro, though Microsoft would prefer its recharged using the proprietary Surface Connect port.</p>
<p>The MicroSDXC slot is gone but the SSD is now user replaceable. I&#8217;m sad Microsoft ditch the MicoSDXC slot. It was a major selling point over an iPad Pro. The SSD is hidden behind a panel under the kickstand. Poke it out, and the SDD is easily accessible and secured with just one screw. Swapping the SSD should take less than a minute.</p>
<h2>Battery life</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is an all-day portable. Though I&#8217;ve only had my test machine for less then a week, I used it constantly and only had to plug it in all night. And I&#8217;m not a Microsoft app person. I use Chrome, Slack, and Xoom instead of Edge and Teams. This is significant. When talking about battery life, Microsoft made it clear it optimized its apps to extend the battery life.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the Surface Pro 8 can get 18 hours of battery life, and I didn&#8217;t hit that number. On average, I saw about 10 hours of battery life from using Chrome, streaming YouTubeTV, and taking video calls.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 features a new active cooling design, and it still gets hot to the touch. Because of the heat, I found it uncomfortable to use as a tablet when editing media. Lightroom runs like a champ but Photoshop causes the Surface Pro 8 to heat up to uncomfortable levels.</p>
<h2>Webcam</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 has a lovely webcam, and it&#8217;s in the right spot. Microsoft threw a little shade at Apple over the placement, too. In the announcement event, a Microsoft spokesperson said with a smile, &#8220;And a front-facing camera, not on the side, but centered &#8212; right where it belongs.&#8221; For some reason, Apple continues to put the camera in the iPad on the shorter side of the screen. This means, when the tablet is in laptop mode and connected to a keyboard, the webcam is shifted to the side &#8212; it&#8217;s an odd webcam experience.</p>
<p>The front-facing camera looks excellent. It features 1080p video and 5mp stills with advanced controls for white balance, exposure, and all the rest.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison with the Surface Pro 8 and iPad Pro (2020).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2212117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png 6977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=768,255 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=680,226 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=1536,510 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=2048,680 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Quick note on Windows 11</h2>
<p>I use a PC for two things: Gaming and media editing. I&#8217;m writing this review on a Mac because that&#8217;s my work environment. Windows is not my daily jam, and Windows 11 is not enticing me to drop Mac OS.</p>
<p>The new start menu is offensive to the user. It takes up a considerable amount of space in the middle of the screen and lacks justification for its size. A large chunk of the new Start Menu is white space. Worse yet, the Start Menu can hardly be customized like previous versions.</p>
<p>I guess the rest of the new Windows experience is acceptable. To me, someone who only uses the top layer of Windows, this new system feels much like the older one.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use widgets on Mac OS, and I doubt I&#8217;ll use them in Windows 11. Right now on my test machine, these widgets are not customizable. I can&#8217;t add widgets though I can customize the pre-installed widgets. They&#8217;re also slow to load and refresh.</p>
<p>Look for our deeper dive on Windows 11 from a daily user.</p>
<h2>Surface Pro 8 vs the iPad Pro</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 and iPad Pro are radically different, yet share a lot of the same target market. Where the Surface Pro 8 runs a full desktop operating system, the iPad Pro runs a mobile, though robust, version of the software running the iPhone.</p>
<p>Both the Surface Pro and iPad Pro have wonderful screens and the touchscreen capabilities are equally impressive. The two styluses work similarly too. Though the new Surface Pen features haptic feedback, the latest Apple Pencil and iPad Pro are seemingly more precise and more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>Picking between the two requires shoppers to look at their use cases. The Surface Pro 8 is a better desktop replacement device, but some users might be better off with a mobile operating system for some tasks.</p>
<p>I have some advice.</p>
<p>Buy the Surface Pro 8 if&#8230;<br />
&#8211; If you&#8217;re looking for a desktop replacement device, complete with the ability to run proprietary software<br />
&#8211; If you need a portable device to run Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise applications<br />
&#8211; If you like to game and streaming Xbox games satisfies that need.<br />
&#8211; If you need a full-size detachable keyboard.</p>
<p>Buy the iPad Pro if&#8230;<br />
&#8211; If you&#8217;re looking for a device to edit media with mainstream applications (Like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom)<br />
&#8211; If you need a high-end portable to run Google&#8217;s G-Suite<br />
&#8211; If you using the basic functions and apps of Microsoft Office 365<br />
&#8211; If you enjoy mobile-first games like those found on smartphones</p>
<h2>Worth it?</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro has never looked better than this latest version. Several key features are missing at launch, but the potential is there. This is a lovely kit with a beautiful display and outstanding build quality. The new stylus is a welcomed upgrade, and Intel&#8217;s latest makes the computer more reliable with performance.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro line has always existed in a weird spot, but this version pushes it close to a mainstream option. In the past, the performance had been just slightly lacking, and the hardware was barely good enough. With the Surface Pro 8, the performance is finally acceptable and the hardware is beautiful. The Surface Pro 8 is the best Windows 2-in-1 available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior care can be a sensitive topic as many older people find themselves in situations where they need care, but are not to the point where they need the kind of around-the-clock care provided by nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many older people still want some independence and to retain their dignity as they age and lose the ability to do some of the more basic tasks they were used to handling on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those older people live alone, with their spouse or with other family members. And for those needing in-home care, navigating options can be overwhelming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth Sternberg founded </span><a href="https://www.joinhonor.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor Technology Inc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup focused on in-home care for older adults, after selling chat service Meebo to Google for about $100 million in 2012. Sternberg worked at Google for a couple of years before facing some care challenges with his own mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at&#8217;s what got me on this idea of ‘how do we help older adults’,” Sternberg recalls. “When you dive on how society cares for older adults, you discover it’s really disorganized, and really fractured. No one knows where to turn. So we founded this space within non medical home care.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;An Ex-Googler Launches An In-Home Care Startup Called Honor And Raises $20 Million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/an-ex-googler-is-launching-an-in-home-care-startup-called-honor-and-raised-20-million/embed/#?secret=Z5NYwmobN8" data-secret="Z5NYwmobN8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, San Francisco-based Honor has announced that it has raised $70 million in Series E funding and $300 million in debt financing, bringing its valuation to over $1.25 billion, which compares to a valuation of $810 million at the time of Honor’s $140 million Series D round of funding in October of 2020. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investor Baillie Gifford led the equity financing, which brings Honor&#8217;s total equity raised to $325 million since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding news comes just two months after Honor revealed it had acquired global home care provider Home Instead in a move that greatly expands its senior care network. It did not reveal the purchase price but in a joint press release issued at the time, Honor said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the combined organization “represents more than $2.1 billion in home care services revenue and affirms itself as the largest player in the projected $500 billion home care industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers &#8212; including funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Prosus Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Thrive Capital, FMZ Ventures, Rock Springs Capital, Lighthouse Capital Markets and TriplePoint Capital also put money in Honor’s latest funding round in addition to Home Instead founders Paul and Lori Hogan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perceptive Advisors led the debt financing with a “significant” commitment from Ares Management funds.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We chose to take on more debt as growth capital rather than equity,&#8221; Sternberg said. &#8220;Based on our performance, new size and scale, debt financing is cheaper than equity financing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its Series D funding round in October of 2020, Honor says it has added hundreds more caregivers — dubbed “Care Pros” —and expanded its care delivery platform to four new states. Its August acquisition of Home Instead, a franchisor of personalized, in-home care services, means that Honor now serves over 100,000 older adults around the world every month, and will be providing more than 80 million hours of care annually, according to Sternberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, the company’s care professionals go into the homes of older adults and help them with ADLs, or activities of daily living, such as bathing, getting dressed and feeding themselves. On average, they spend about 20 hours per week in a client’s home.</span></p>

Co-founders Cameron Ring, Sandy Jen, Monica Lo and Seth Sternberg (CEO), alongside Home Instead CEO Jeff Huber.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Honor launched in 2015, it was soon after named a &#8220;best startup of the year&#8221; at Disrupt amid a time where “no one” had been applying technology to help older adults, Sternberg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor began with the goal of matching seniors with professionals who could take care of them in their homes while providing family members relevant information needed to help stay on top of their care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the startup shifted its model so that the people providing the care were actual employees, and not just contractors, with benefits. By helping its care professionals feel taken care of themselves, the company hoped to foster more loyalty and continuity of care through decreased turnover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to acquiring Home Instead, Honor was in select markets and launched into eight states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were going market by market,” Sternberg said. “With us acquiring Home Instead, we are now literally everywhere in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to further invest in its technology and expand it across the Home Instead network. It also plans to triple the size of its engineering and product team within the next year, notes Honor co-founder and CTO Sandy Jen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a huge and highly fragmented market &#8212; estimated at over $80 billion annually, and $50 billion in the U.S. alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor’s platform continues to match “the right caregivers with the right clients” based on a range of personalized factors. It also assists with caregiver recruiting, training, scheduling and performance analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology improves as the company scales, according to Sternberg, learning from expanding data points to further optimize performance. This tech-enabled approach strengthens the relationships between professional caregivers and clients while streamlining business operations, centralizing care and reducing turnover &#8212; ultimately increasing the ability of Honor and Home Instead to meet rapidly growing demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Honor started selling its operating system to other home health care agencies &#8212; which state they are “powered by Honor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment researcher Anika Penn of Baillie Gifford believes that so much of the way home care is delivered invites misalignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she said, many traditional senior home care options are lacking in transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers traditionally</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t know what happens from visit to visit, caregivers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t sure how many hours of work they will get, companies aren’t sure how many caregivers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they’ll have available in any given region,” noted Penn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also inefficiencies associated with maintaining paper records of visits or handling manual scheduling that increases lag times for processing, payments and scheduling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This adds to the anxiety for everyone involved,” she wrote via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her firm invested in Honor because its technology and operations platform, combined with the reach they now have with the Home Instead network, “brings consistency, trust and excellence to an industry that desperately needs it,” Penn said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood announced Tuesday that it will be bringing &#8220;24/7&#8221; phone support to its 31 million users. It&#8217;s a long overdue move for the stock and crypto trading company founded in 2013, but one that signals its maturation following a challenging year that brought the company its biggest crisis, a surge in trading volume and its own entry to public markets.</p>
<p>Users with a question or account issue will now be able to request a call inside the Robinhood app and receive a call back some time later from a support agent. Previously users had been pushed towards the option of messaging the company and escalating the issue through an email chain, while limited phone support had been offered for specific customer trading issues at certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>While Robinhood is certainly not the first trading firm to offer phone support for its users &#8212; the company has been criticized in the past for its limited customer support options &#8212; Robinhood crypto lead Christine Brown notes that it is the first crypto exchange to launch phone support, and hopes that the increased level of support with provide an added level of assurance for users plunging into crypto trading for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;By being the first to offer this service, I think we&#8217;re further reducing the barriers that a lot of our users might think of when they think of crypto trading,&#8221; Brown tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think a lot of people today think that the crypto exchanges are very hard to onboard onto&#8230; and god forbid, you ever have an issue, email support &#8212; let alone phone support &#8212; is scarce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scaling its support team to handle the phones for tens of millions of users has meant a hiring spree for Robinhood. Brown says they have tripled the size of the internal team and have also tapped a large number of contractors to handle phone support. Robinhood&#8217;s customer support army will be a &#8220;fairly even&#8221; split between internal Robinhood employees and contractors, Brown says. Users will be assigned to a particular agent based on the topic they&#8217;re calling about.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t advertising any guarantees for the amount of time between sending a request and receiving a phone call from the company, acknowledging that certain market events may stress test their systems, but Brown says that generally their internal target is to call back a user within 30 minutes of making a request.</p>
<p>The structure of this flow will likely frustrate some users who might prefer a phone number they can call, and some key types of issues will clearly fall through the cracks including when a user is locked out of their account or having a major issue with the app. In a launch blog post, the company details they&#8217;re working on a solution to bring phone support for users locked out of their accounts, though that features rollout will be sometime in &#8220;the coming months.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customer support workflows are made to be stress-tested, and Robinhood is certainly no stranger to the damaging effects and challenges of unexpected market frenzies.</p>
<p>The company took a major hit to its reputation earlier this year amid a meme stock trading surge that forced the company to cease or heavily limit trading of popular stocks like GameStop. At the time, some users felt they were seeing yet another example of a financial institution protecting the professional investor class, while it soon came to light that Robinhood was financially unprepared for the trading frenzy and was forced to raise emergency funding to keep up with investor demand. That incident highlighted some of the company&#8217;s strategic communication missteps but also showcased the limited support paths users had to speak with representatives from the company and have their questions answered in a timely manner.</p>

<p>The funding round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/okta-ventures/">Okta Ventures</a> and existing investor Vertex Ventures Israel, follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/adaptive-shield-raises-4m-for-its-saas-security-platform/">a $4 million seed round in 2019</a>. The company tells TechCrunch it will use this latest investment to further accelerate growth through product innovation and global expansion, as well as to build out its research and development, customer success, and sales teams.</p>
<p>Adaptive Shield, which already has customers among Fortune 500 companies, aims to put an end to costly data breaches caused by SaaS security configuration errors that can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/dow-jones-watchlist-leak/">expose corporate data</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/11/security-lapse-nasa-project-data-exposed/">government projects</a>. These errors are the second-largest cause of data breaches, according to the startup, and can leave organizations open to one-click corporate espionage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, and exposure of their cloud data.</p>
<p>While many other security companies offer cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools that focus on the infrastructure layer, Adaptive Shield focuses on the cloud application layer. The company&#8217;s so-called SaaS Security Posture Management platform, or SSPM, looks for and fixes misconfigurations across SaaS platforms for all global settings and user privileges.</p>
<p>“Expecting security teams to stay on top of SaaS Security misconfigurations without a proper SSPM solution in place is like expecting a bodyguard to protect an invisible person,” said Adaptive Shield co-founder and chief executive Maor Bin, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">led cloud research at Proofpoint</a>. “Deep visibility and continuous maintenance of SaaS security hygiene is crucial to keeping the company secure.”</p>
<p>The platform currently supports more than 50 SaaS applications including GitHub, Office 365, Salesforce, Slack, and Zoom, and Adaptive Shield tells TechCrunch it will expand this support to 150-200 applications by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“With the average company using 80 SaaS applications, our extensive support is a major competitive advantage,” the startup says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The availability of data can paralyze a company and its effort to bring software-centric products and services to market. To solve this issue, two-year-old data startup <a href="https://www.rendered.ai/">Rendered.ai</a> is generating synthetic data for the satellite, medical, robotics and automotive industries.</p>
<p>At its most broad, synthetic data is manufactured rather than gathered from the real world. “When we use the term synthetic data what we really mean is engineered simulated datasets, and in particular, we focus on a physics-based simulation,” Rendered.ai CEO Nathan Kundtz explained in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Kundtz received his PhD in physics from Duke University and cut his teeth in the space industry, heading the satellite antenna developer Kymeta Corporation. After leaving that company, he started working with other small space companies, when he noticed what he called a “chicken and egg” problem.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a company develops a new kind of sensor for a satellite and is looking for funding to commercialize. The company would need to demonstrate to investors that the sensor could generate a useful insight. In order to generate these insights, the company would need to launch a constellation and start collecting a large amount of data.</p>
<p>“This lack of access to data was hindering artificial intelligence,” he said.</p>
<h2>Investor interest</h2>
<p>Rendered.ai’s approach to opening up that access has caught the attention of investors. The company has raised a $6 million seed round led by Space Capital, with participation from Tectonic Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Union Labs and Uncorrelated Ventures.</p>
<p>Using a physics-based approach distinguishes Rendered.ai from some of its competitors, which are using purely generative methods to create synthetic data. That means these competitors are taking an existing data set and engineering more of it. Generally, this is accomplished using generative adversarial networks (GANs), an AI technique that uses competing neural networks to simulate and refine synthetic data. According to Kundtz, that’s of limited utility to emerging industries, that often have very little or no data to start with.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are other factors that can affect a company’s ability to get data. It can be a costly, difficult and time-consuming process.  These issues get worse with non-RGB images, like those generated by synthetic aperture radar.</p>
<p>So how does physics solve this problem of generating new information? “We can introduce new information to the process of creating these algorithms through our knowledge of physics, through the equations that govern, for instance, how light interacts with things,” Kundtz said. “So we can simulate what things will look like under different scenarios and then use that to generate datasets.”</p>
<h2>A toolkit for developers</h2>
<p>Rendered.ai has developed a platform that includes a no-code configuration tool and APIs to let customers engineer and tweak the parameters on a data set, and a set of tools for dataset introspection and data analysis. The company also provides some starter code for specific applications that customers are interested in, like satellite imagery. The company calls this Platform as a Service.</p>
<p>While a Rendered.ai customer does need a certain amount of expertise to use the system, Kundtz said that amount is decreasing each day; some of the funding is going to go toward continuing to lower to skill set required to use the platform.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re pushing towards is, anybody who can click a button in a browser can generate synthetic data, and not just synthetic data but can really control the types of synthetic data that they want and can introduce that into the rest of a machine learning workflow.”</p>
<p>But you don’t know what you don’t know — a company wouldn’t necessarily know in advance the parameters needed to make a synthetic dataset effective or an algorithm functioning. Rendered.ai takes an iterative approach, and emphasizes the interactivity of its platform as a way for customers to identify the gaps in its algorithm or better understand its blind spots.</p>
<p>Kundtz says he doesn’t think synthetic data will completely replace real-world data, but that it will come to play an increasingly important gap for artificial intelligence applications. It also has the potential to take even a smidge of power from companies like Google, which have proprietary access to trillions of images and mountains of datasets.</p>
<p>Rendered.ai has already brought a handful of customers onto its platform but it’s still essentially in beta, so the funding is going to be used to expand access to the platform as well as investing in particular types of data for specific verticals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ZAX's  platform unites freight, delivery and payments tools to connect sellers and buyers in Brazil.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Keeping a small sales business afloat in Latin America can involve long bus trips to find new products, lack of working capital and payment difficulties. These inefficiencies then trickle up to wholesalers who then have to raise costs and deadlines for deliveries.</p>
<p>This caught the attention of second-time entrepreneurs Bruno Ballardie and Fernando Zanatta, who started <a href="https://www.zaxapp.com.br/">ZAX</a> in 2019 to develop a platform that unites freight, delivery and payments tools to connect sellers and buyers in Brazil.</p>
<p>Prior to starting ZAX, CEO Ballardie was founder of eÓtica, a glasses e-commerce company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/23/brazils-26-billion-eyewear-industry-moves-online-with-lema21-and-eotica-merger/">merged with Lema21 in 2018</a>. CTO Zanatta was founder of Netlolo, a tool that connected clients with global experts, and was also previously CTO for Dafiti and COO for Buscapé.</p>
<p>They saw a direct-to-consumer market that was becoming huge thanks to technology and innovation, but a wholesale sector that wasn’t seeing the same kind of growth. Many people traveled to city centers like São Paulo to buy inventory, but were using pen and paper to write orders and WhatsApp to transact.</p>
<p>“We saw a huge opportunity to help people make a great business,” Ballardie told TechCrunch. “The market was lagging — there is only 7% of e-commerce penetration, and in the wholesale sector, it is 1% or lower. All of the area was underdeveloped in terms of logistics, payments and products discovery, so we created a tool for that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ZAX’s addressable market for B2B transactions, just in Brazil, is estimated to be BRL 2.4 trillion, or $445.6 billion, Ballardie said. ZAX’s platform was initially a clothing wholesale, but has expanded to shoes, electronics, toys, accessories and beauty items. Buyers come on the platform, choose their products, then the method of shipment and the form of payment.</p>
<p>Today, ZAX raised $6 million in Series A funding in a round that was led by Atlantico and included FJ Labs, Caravela Capital, GFC and Canary. GFC and Canary each led one of ZAX’s previous investment rounds. The new capital brings the company’s total funding to $8.3 million.</p>
<p>“ZAX has shown a great execution in a very short period,” said Julio Vasconcellos, Atlantico’s managing partner, in a written statement. “They have a lot of potential to help sellers and buyers not only in Brazil, but throughout Latin America, where wholesale and retail can grow a lot by using more technology.”</p>
<p>ZAX is working with over 700 suppliers — an increase from 100 prior to the pandemic — and since March 2020, its revenue has grown 10 times, Ballardie said. It has a team of 65 employees and has more than 50,000 buyers using the platform.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to expand into two more regions in Brazil and add to its product lines in the beauty products and accessories categories. Ballardie also wants to hire additional technology and product development staff.</p>
<p>Next up, ZAX is investing in financial services, piloting some buy now, pay later initiatives and integrating financial partners to provide working capital for customers. The company now offers a 30-day line of capital and point-of-sale system and will follow up with a digital wallet and other payment tools in the future.</p>
