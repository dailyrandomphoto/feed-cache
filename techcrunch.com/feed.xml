										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra, which has developed a no-code tool for designers and programmers to build professional apps, has raised $2.3 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Vieira Costa founded Rio de Janeiro-based </span><a href="https://abstra.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March of 2020. Costa graduated from college in 2018 and already has one startup sale under his belt. The serial entrepreneur, who says he’s been programming since he was seven years old, previously co-founded and served as CTO to an edtech startup, PaperX. That company </span><a href="https://www.startse.com/noticia/startups/edtech/descomplica-adquire-startup-focada-no-desenvolvimento-de-testes-e-simulados" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold to the larger, venture-backed edtech </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descomplica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Costa was 23 years old. Before college, he had also co-founded a game studio called Sinextra that he says “had some huge Brazilian customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal with Abstra is simple: to help people make apps without coding. It is, in particular, good for agencies who want to deliver faster results or for non-technical departments that need to iterate faster but depend on centralized engineering teams to implement everything, according to Costa. With Abstra,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designers and junior programmers can build professional websites and apps “much faster than senior developers in bigger companies,” Costa said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We allow easy-to-use customization without the UI limitations that no-code tools commonly have,” he added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no-code is supposed to already be easy, Costa believes that some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no-code tools struggle to serve designers because they need a lot of fine tuning while having no coding skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some are too technical while others are just assembling pre-built interfaces,” he said. “We are developing a mechanism that tackles both problems in that it is easy to use and flexible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra is focused on late-/growth-stage tech companies and enterprise IT consulting companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the startup is growing MRR (monthly recurring revenue) 45% on average and has landed 11 customers, including Accenture, Stone and Descomplica. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s spring 2021 batch before catching SoftBank’s eye. Iporanga, Alexia Ventures and some angels have also put money in the company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic, every business has had “to go somewhat digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This exploded the demand for software production,” Costa told TechCrunch. “But there are just not enough developers available. So no-code was hugely beneficial with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young startup got the opportunity to pitch Accenture, a consulting firm that had over $50 billion in revenue in 2021, because Costa had a friend in common with some people who worked there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I showed our results from previous clients and a product demo and they decided to run a pilot at  that same meeting,” Costa told TechCrunch. “They are now one of our most active users. As an enterprise consulting firm, using tools like ours makes them much more competitive.”</span></p>
<p>Alexia Ventures&#8217; Patrick Arippol told TechCrunch that his firm believes that the &#8220;no and low code opportunity set is in its early days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstra’s initial product showed much promise and potential at a global level, based on early customer feedback and on the product’s architecture and underlying premises,&#8221; he wrote via email.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use the new capital primarily toward beefing up its current nine-person staff, particularly across its engineering, marketing, sales and operations teams.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the new year! Yes, welcome to 2022 from the Equity team. We hope that our holiday episodes kept you entertained, and warm. But it&#8217;s now back to work, so let&#8217;s get into the news:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Global stocks are generally higher today, while cryptos are mostly flat. In the last week, major cryptocurrencies have lost value.</li>
<li>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/02/twitter-bans-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-personal-account-over-covid-19-misinformation/">banned Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene</a> for &#8220;repeated violations of [its] COVID-19 misinformation policy.&#8221;</li>
<li>India is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/india-antitrust-watchdog-orders-investigation-into-apples-business-practices/">investigating Apple&#8217;s payment system for iOS</a>.</li>
<li>Tesla Q4 deliveries <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2021-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html">came in above expectations</a>, leading to the company&#8217;s stock surging in pre-market trading. NIO also saw a bump, which means that EV startups are also having a good day.</li>
<li>The Sensetime IPO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sensetime-shares-jump-in-hong-kong-market-debut-11640842080?mod=djemalertNEWS">happened</a> while Equity was on break. Despite raising far less than it had once wanted, the company&#8217;s Hong Kong IPO is now in the books, and doing well as a trading equity.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/02/aimmo-grabs-12m-series-a-to-advance-data-labeling-technology/">AIMMO raised $12 million in a Series A</a>. The company provides data labeling tooling for enterprise customers building AI models.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is taking a much-deserved holiday out in nature, so I&#8217;ll be taking over this week to give you the news and wish you both a Happy New Year and a swift hangover recovery.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s officially 2022, but let&#8217;s take a quick look over the past year. To quickly sum up &#8212; everyone bought e-bikes; robotaxis and autonomous trucks are getting closer to commercialization; teleoperated sidewalk delivery robots are becoming a thing; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Association is keeping an eye on the likes of Tesla and Chevy; pretty much every OEM is investing serious cash into electrifying, and that includes battery joint ventures; and eVTOLs got a huge amount of investment.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig a bit deeper into that last. My colleague Aria Alamalhodaei wrote a two-part series on the trends shaping the eVTOL space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/top-evtol-trends-2021/">The first part looked back at 2021</a>, highlighting such trends as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPACs have been taking off and helping fuel a stupid amount of money into the industry, with companies like <strong>Archer Aviation</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>, <strong>Lilium</strong> and <strong>Vertical Aerospace </strong>all merging with blank check companies.</li>
<li>On-the-ground infrastructure, like vertiports and chargers, is turning into its own business unit, and companies like <strong>Archer</strong>, <strong>Hyundai </strong>and <strong>Volocopter</strong> are exploring ways to integrate air mobility into a city&#8217;s existing transport networks.</li>
<li>There have been increased orders for eVTOL aircraft, starting with <strong>United Airline&#8217;s</strong> $1 billion order with Archer.</li>
<li>Automakers &#8212; like Hyundai, <strong>Honda</strong> and <strong>Xpeng</strong> &#8212; are investing resources into building their own flying cars.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this movement is setting the stage for what&#8217;s to come in 2022. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/the-evtol-take-off-part-two-looking-ahead-to-2022/">Some of Aria&#8217;s predictions are</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The main story of 2022, it’s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</li>
<li>More automakers will start getting involved in the space. That much is clear from major investments from <strong>Toyota</strong> and <strong>Stellantis</strong> into <strong>Joby</strong> and a manufacturing deal with <strong>Archer</strong>, respectively.</li>
<li>More SPAC deals. Aria writes that it&#8217;s not a given, &#8220;but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re making predictions, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t share some thoughts about what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/micromobility-in-2022-refined-mature-and-packed-full-of-tech/">2022 may hold for the world of micromobility</a>. I spoke to a few experts and came up with some interesting, and even wacky, responses.</p>
<p>Crystal ball says&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>More e-bikes will hit the shared micromobility space.</li>
<li>Fresh VC money is drying up and there aren&#8217;t likely to be more new entrants into the space. Those who have made it this far are likely here to stay, and they&#8217;re becoming more mature and more efficient.</li>
<li>That said, the ride-hail companies (aka <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong>) might be coming back to play, says <strong>Segway&#8217;s</strong> Tony Ho, based on orders and inquiries for vehicles he&#8217;s seeing come in.</li>
<li>All that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter ADAS</a> we started to see last year? Yeah, it&#8217;s here to stay, and will only increase. But that&#8217;s not all! Buckle up for smarter vehicles that will not only affect the way you ride, but will also provide operators with more monetization opportunities. Data. Is. Everything. Operators will be looking for ways to sell sensor data.</li>
<li>Horace Dediu, industry analyst and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast, reckons there&#8217;ll be far more integration of micromobiilty options with transit planning apps like Google Maps.</li>
<li>He also said we can expect a marriage between micromobility and the metaverse. The f&amp;%!, you might be thinking. Wait for it. Imagine a smart helmet with an augmented reality-enabled visor, pointing out directions for you or enticing you into the nearest coffee shop with a floating coupon!</li>
<li>New, heavier, form factors. Personally, I wanna see a tiny vehicle with a roof, already! We don&#8217;t all love getting caught in the rain.</li>
<li>Better integration of micromobility offerings with public transit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In other news&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voi </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/2250109/">just raised a $115 million Series D</a> in what it describes as an oversubscribed funding round that will help it expand into new markets. As scooter companies consolidate their power, such a big raise this late in the game is definitely significant.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Mobility</strong>, which has sold off Italian and Israeli operations in recent months, is now upgrading its e-scooter fleet in Nottingham and Derby in the U.K. with LINK e-scooters from <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>. Users will now need to download the LINK app to continue using Wind&#8217;s service&#8230; so is it really Wind&#8217;s service anymore?</p>
<p>Superpedestrian also launched 150 seated scooters in Baltimore to provide a safer and more comfortable transportation option to people with disabilities and older riders.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What with the holidays, there haven&#8217;t been too many deals, but I did notice AI chip maker <strong>Kneron&#8217;s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ai-chip-kneron-25-million-funding/">$25 million raise</a>. The Chinese startup will use the funding to start making chips for autonomous driving applications. This move comes as the company possibly prepares to go public in the U.S. in the next few years, and with an increased number of AV companies aiming to scale over the same time frame, Kneron might be one to watch.</p>
<p>The other deal that caught my eye is South Africa&#8217;s <strong>Planet42</strong>, a car subscription company that buys used cars from dealerships and rents to customers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/south-africas-planet42-gets-30m-for-its-car-subscription-service-mexico-expansion/">just raised $30 million in equity and debt.</a> The round is a bridge round, a precursor to a Series A, and it will help the company expand into the Mexican market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizing information from providers, insurers and patients not only takes a lot of time, but increases private healthcare costs. <a href="https://www.smarterhealth.sg/">Smarter Health</a>, a Singaporean-based startup, develops technology that allows smoother exchange of data between different parties in the healthcare system, improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The company announced today it has raised a $5.15 million SGD (about $3.8 million USD) Series A led by East Ventures for product development and to expand in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Other investors included Orbit Malaysia, Citrine Capital, HMI Group and Emtek.</p>
<p>The company currently operates in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and plans to enter into new countries with its new funding. The new round brings Smarter Health’s total raised to $8 million SGD.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smarter Health’s platform isn’t meant to replace legacy software already in use by its clients. Instead, it seeks to work with them, and reduce manual processes. The startup’s AI-based tech enables secure data exchanges (with patient consent) between healthcare providers, insurers and patients. This enables it to offer a roster of services. For payors and insurers, this includes a patient concierge that recommends specialists, schedules appointments and creates demographic profiles of policy holders. It also automates claims assessments, updates insurers about cases and makes the bill and claims adjudication process faster.</p>
<p>The company has three main customer categories: doctors, hospitals and insurers and other corporate payors, like AIA, Allianz and Prudential, which make up the bulk of its business.</p>
<p>For healthcare organizations and providers, Smarter Health offers specialist recommendations and patient registration tools, a load-levelling solution that shortens waiting times and digitized hospital admissions and claim submissions.</p>
<p>In a statement, East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has forced insurers and healthcare providers to reflect and re-strategize on their operations, catalyzing digital transformation. Smarter Health is here to make healthcare accessible, affordable and accountable by providing an AI-powered interoperable platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few years, Dell (and its gaming brand, Alienware) has grown fond of showing off concept devices – as a potential look at what may be coming down the road. In fact, it’s a growing trend in the consumer electronics industry at large, taking a page out of the automotive world’s book. Depending on how you look at it, it’s either an intriguing glimpse into a potential future or a bit of a red herring.</p>
<p>For Dell, it’s an opportunity to gauge community interest for a technology that’s not quite ready for primetime. The best known recent example is Concept UFO, a handheld gaming console Alienware showed off this time last year, which, to date, is still very much a concept.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250149" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250149" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg 3976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-Nyx-close-up-Embargoed-until-1.3.22.-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250149" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alienware</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Concept Nyx joins the product this year, essentially operating as an at-home server that can stream games throughout the home. The ultimate idea behind the product lets houses stream multiple games to multiple devices at once, regardless of the hardware they’re playing on. The controller, meanwhile, serves as the primary contact, connecting to a smart TV, computer or other device and playing the game through a Dell app.</p>
<p>There are likely some kinks to work out, including pricing and the sort of compute power necessary to play as stream multiple games at once. Adding a bunch of CPUs and GPUs onto a product adds up pretty fast, though none of this sounds too far outside of the realm of possibility, streaming over home WiFi.</p>
<p>I think the bigger question at hand is how much demand there is for a thing. I suspect a large portion of its potential audience have already invested in gaming PCs or consoles. And even if they haven’t, such a product would have to be competitively priced – certainly the promise of streaming two (or even four) games at once in a house isn’t worth a product that costs the same as two consoles for most scenarios.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250150" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250150" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="694" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg 2558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=1536,1041 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=2048,1387 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alienware</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company writes in a blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been looking at how to power four game streams simultaneously, smart switching among devices, and drawing from a central library of all your games regardless of where you purchase them. Gaming on Concept Nyx aims to be as effortless as accessing your favorite music, TV shows and movies. Imagine a simple app loaded on each device delivering instant access to all your games for a more seamless gaming experience across devices in the home. Imagine no more fighting with your family or roommates over game time (you can still fight over groceries and laundry). Wouldn’t it be nice to tear down the barricades so that everyone can game on their own terms?</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is firmly in the concept phase, but in its current iteration, Nyx sounds likely to be nixed before hitting the market.</p>

<p>This argument over Web3 is really exciting. How does one call out either of the two main protagonists? Jack Dorsey has an unlimited hall pass now that he&#8217;s free of Wall Street&#8217;s hound dogging adult supervision of Twitter, and he&#8217;s using it for some subtle purpose. I don&#8217;t know the guy well, but I&#8217;ve always appreciated his counter-conventional attitude toward great truths he has no time for. Marc Andreessen I don&#8217;t know so well either, but I&#8217;m desperate not to be blocked by him. I listened to a Kara Swisher Twitter Space today, where she has already been blocked for some reason. She&#8217;s becoming my favorite media personality for asking all the questions I might have in a format (live audio) where I will never be invited on stage. As a consequence I find her spaces to be a fantastic validation of the new format because when she&#8217;s there, the distinctions between host and speaker and listener are irrelevant.</p>
<p>As Doc Searls reminds me, people in our age bracket are dropping like flies. A few weeks ago we talked about Kim Cameron of the Identity Gang; this week it&#8217;s Chris Locke, of Cluetrain fame. We recorded on Clubhouse and the link is in the newsletter below. As you&#8217;ll hear, he was nicknamed Rageboy for all the right reasons, an original voice who came along as the Internet gave voice to anyone who showed up. According to Doc, he pretty much invented Cluetrain on the wings of the previous generation of rageboys, with names like Vonnegut and most definitional Hunter S. Thompson. Like John Lennon, who brought Paul in, and Paul, who brought George in, and George, who brought Ringo in, Locke connected Doc, David Weinberger, and a technologist, Rick Levine, who built the website that morphed into the business book. The last add reminds me of the guy in Monty Python who did all the surreal animations that connected the tissues of the group together.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Markets are conversations, Doc and the Cluetrain said, and at the time many felt they understood the fundamental note, what Doc now calls the promise of independence. Today&#8217;s conversation about Web3 feels important and epoch-changing, but the last years of Trumpism and the pandemic leave us more cautious about the impact of technology. My semi-literate guess is that both Jack and Marc represent a conversation that depends on both being right, yet the media wants an argument and an afterparty rope line. I don&#8217;t hear agreement so much as the John and Paul dialogue: Getting better all the time, Can&#8217;t get much worse.</p>
<p>As the warriors of the early Internet begin to pass from the scene, I remember the flush of optimism of that earlier time. The battles were over things like owning our own data, being able to transport it from platform to platform, and forging the social media moment into something we could run with in the broader media world. The influencer role was an outgrowth of that surge, the endorsement model its economic driver. It always felt akin to a record deal in the 70’s and 80’s; you pulled enough of a base to fund a recording session, then shopped it to a label. Success was radio airplay, and the hope of a contract for more recording and support for touring.</p>
<p>At its inception, podcasting offered a bootstrap past the record companies and their marketing departments to a more elastic audience development environment. You no longer needed access to the radio funnel with its strictures of expensive recoupable recording time, loss leader showcase performances, and a scratch-my-back, I’ll-scratch-yours quid pro quo insider angle. All those things were still there, but the scale was compressed.</p>
<p>Recordings could be assembled with low-cost prosumer equipment, synthesizers and MIDI bridged the gap between home and studio settings, and sometimes hit records emerged that used a hybrid between the two domains. The Stones in particular worked up riffs on cassettes and moved the actual tracks over to multitracks for sweetening. On the other end of the pipeline, Stevie Wonder used the same overdubbing and multi-track building of home recording to take complete control of the studio as he went from the Motown music factory to music he wrote, played most if not all of the instruments, and partnered with engineers and technologists to spawn a generation of tools that worked fairly transparently across the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s smart phones, cloud services, and app stores provide much the same transfer of power from the labels to the creators. Newletters and live audio networks make it possible to write, record, and distribute material at little or no additional expense. You can effectively create an audience one post at a time, using social media to promote and engage with a growing network of hosts, speakers, and listeners that float between roles in a social and aspirational way. On Clubhouse, record/replay tools produce what are reminiscent of Top Ten lists of most popular replays. Next up will be most popular with certain groups and mining of metadata about how the members of those groups behave with related shows and artists. This evolution of what used to be called liner notes until the CD format and streaming crushed it drove the market from Top Forty radio to deep cut album-oriented FM, and from there to Netflix analytics that determine renewals based on shows’ impact on retention of valuable subscribers.</p>
<p>As I read this, word choice feels forced and arbitrary. I’m failing at communicating why I like this new platform. Perhaps it’s the excessive noise about the creator economy. Is it an economy when the money to be made is at best an after thought to attracting the same media system ostensibly being reformed? Perhaps it’s the melancholy feeling of viewing the present through the prism of the fading past. I can’t remember the details of that earlier time, just the energy that seemed to pulse out of the electric realtime global moment. A live streaming show captures some of that, but not the shared excitement of the possibilities of the era. I got a glimpse of it the first time I launched a Clubhouse room; the random architecture of the notification and follow system drew a very few people, but more than enough to see how this will supersede full production podcasting as it absorbs it.</p>
<p>As with a similar Twitter Space conversation, you could watch listeners drop in, leave, and over time drop back in. My assumption is that the discussion was marginally more interesting or potentially so than other long tail alternatives. Backing the recording up is a 24 hour-plus crapshoot to enable transcription services, so Clubhouse wins for the moment. And the history of the early days of Twitter v. Facebook shows most early adopters will join both to drive improvements in production automation and analytics extraction. This is not the economy at work but more the environment of early film schools like NYU and USC that spawned a community of directors and producers like Lucas, Coppola, and Scorsese that dominated the New Wave of Hollywood filmmaking.</p>
<p>It’s a fragile thing, market-forming, and not at all clear the commitment of these players to anything other than a winner-take-all strategy. Even though the viral attractions of Twitter are seductive, its past history of bailing on third-party developers and acquisitions like Vine and Periscope helps keep Clubhouse in the game as Twitter wrestles with a post-Dorsey resource battle at the parent company. And it’s not just a Field of Dreams story. Sure, if they build it, they will come. But that’s not what “they” will stay for.</p>
<p>Take the cable networks. Please. How much longer will we stare openmouthed at the dismantling of democracy. Or the war with the virus. We long for answers, not growth opportunities. I read a review of the new Don’t Look Up asteroid movie that described it as good but not great. It’s often characterized as a climate change allegory, but for me it was only about Trump winning reelection. Half the country wouldn’t believe the asteroid was coming until they could see it in the nightime sky, but what really hurt was how many didn’t believe it when they could see it.</p>
<p>The review was on Medium, another Field of Dreams startup. Another post concerned the trope that we’re seeing Omicron turn the pandemic into the common cold. Wishful thinking, but not backed up with the data, which the author says suggests the result could be milder or just as possible more severe. Not comforting, but ever more consequential if we act on the science not our hopes. Technology serves us when we follow the data and take sides. The story of the Beatles is not why they broke up but rather how they got together for so long in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most artificial intelligence models are trained through supervised learning, meaning that humans must label raw data. Data labeling is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a critical part of automating artificial intelligence and machine learning model, but at the same time, it can be time-consuming and tedious work.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Korean startup called <a href="https://en.aimmo.ai/">AIMMO</a>, which uses software and humans to label and categorize image, video, sound, text and sensor fusion data, built an AI data annotation platform, enabling the data labeling faster for enterprises. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AIMMO announced today it has raised $12 million in a Series A round to advance its data labeling technology and spur global expansions. Seven venture capital firms participated in the latest round: DS Asset Management, Industrial Bank of Korea, Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">S&amp;S Investment, Toss Investment, Korea Asset Investment &amp; Securities </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and Venture Field. AIMMO declined to comment on its valuation.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252386" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The pandemic accelerated transforming contactless technology with AI deployment for intelligence surveillance, smart city, autonomous driving, smart factory and robotics where AI data is inevitably needed,” Doyle Chung, Head of Global Sales of AIMMO, said in an email interview. “Among all the directions and industries, our focuses are [mainly] smart city and autonomous driving.” </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by chief executive officer SeungTaek Oh, the startup has three data annotation tools: AIMMO DaaS, which manages sensor fusion data for autonomous vehicle corporations; AIMMO GtaaS, a turnkey-based platform for big data; and AIMMO Enterprises, launched in 2020, a web-based SaaS annotation labeling tool using cloud architecture.</p>
<p>The startup said its tools help improve the inefficiency of the data annotation process so that customers focus only on their AI modeling. There’s no platform fee, coding skills and installation required for AIMMO Enterprises that users can label their data via browsers like Chrome.  As for its AIMMO GtaaS, users send raw data to AIMMO that labels the data with inspection and delivers it back to the customers, Chung said.</p>
<p>Through the AIMMO DaaS platform,  its sales and volume of its data labeling increased by 200% in 2021 compared to the previous year. AIMMO posted $10 million of revenue in 2021, according to its IR pitch deck. The company expects its growth in 2022, with the global demand for the autonomous driving field continually increasing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The global data collection and labeling market size was valued at $1.6 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $8.2 billion in 2028, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-collection-labeling-market"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a market analysis report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Grand View Research. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AIMMO works with an array of companies, including carmaker <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/">Hyundai Motor</a>, car parts developer <a href="https://en.mobis.co.kr/main/index.do">Hyundai Mobis</a></span>, car-hailing startup<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Kakao Mobility, car-sharing startup SoCar </span>and autonomous cargo developer <a href="https://www.thordrive.ai/">ThoreDrive</a>. AIMMO also works with non-autonomous vehicle companies in robotics, optical character recognition (OCR), smart factory, intelligent surveillance, e-commerce, and logistics industries, like <span data-preserver-spaces="true">telco corporation <a href="https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html">SK Telecom</a></span>, internet giants Naver and Kakao and Japanese <a href="https://www.komatsu.com/">Komatsu</a>.</p>
<p>The Korea-headquartered startup has offices in the U.K, the U.S., Japan and Vietnam. Chung said it also plans to open offices in Germany and Canada in 2022. AIMMO will compete with companies like Scale AI, Playment, Understand.ai and Deepen AI when it expands further to the global market. Today, the startup has 200 employees across the globe and more than 10,000 data labelers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has permanently suspended the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) &#8220;for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,&#8221; according to the company. Her official government account remains active.</p>
<p>Rep. Greene has been prolific in the posting of articles and statistics supposedly pertaining to the pandemic but often are misleading or flat-out wrong. This is one of the topics on which Twitter has drawn a line in the sand, as misinformation on the virus, how it spreads, the efficacy of the vaccines, etc has a serious effect on public health.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy">Twitter&#8217;s COVID-19 policy is outlined here</a>; in a statement, the company said &#8220;We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The permanent ban comes after several shorter account locks and warnings, which occurred and were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-mjt-twitter-suspension/">reported on throughout 2021</a>. Greene complained then of violations of her &#8220;freedom of speech,&#8221; despite Twitter being a privately owned and operated platform with clearly stated rules, and made a final complaint in a statement this morning: &#8220;Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth. That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this statement means that she will discontinue her own use of this &#8220;enemy&#8221; platform she claims not to need. Her official U.S. Representative account remains online, though it has not been used in a week. I&#8217;ve asked Twitter whether this account too has been put in jeopardy by her violations, and will update this post if I hear back.</p>
<p>Twitter regularly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">issues bans to fringe figures</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/twitter-bans-james-okeefe-of-project-veritas-over-fake-account-policy/">who have violated rules</a> on inciting violence, publishing false or private information, or spreading false information regarding the pandemic.</p>
<p>This story is developing, check back later for updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The biggest and most eye-wateringly silly rebrand of the year is uncontested: Facebook, one of the most recognizable names in the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">changed its name to Meta</a> in order to <del>distract from unflaggingly awful decisions and the irreparable harm it has caused countless people</del> focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">the &#8220;metaverse,&#8221;</a> something no one asked for and certainly no one wanted Facebook of all companies to take the lead on.</p>
<h3>Block this out</h3>

<p>Meta’s not the only rebrand that went teeth-grindingly meta this year. Readers, we present… <a href="https://www.block.xyz">Block</a>, FKA Square, originally a small business champion known for square-shaped card swiping dongles (quant!). Now, it’s taking a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">bite out of blockchain</a> for its new name and identity, although apparently Block is not just about that. The company says it’s also a reference to block parties, building code, obstacles to overcome, “and of course, tungsten cubes.” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/cryptocurrency-enthusiasts-are-obsessed-dense-tungsten-cubes-rcna4283">click for more cringe</a>) Well, not so fast, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201006139/en/Square-Inc.-Changes-Name-to-Block">Jack</a>! H&amp;R Block is already <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/16/2353519/0/en/H-R-Block-Files-Trademark-Infringement-Lawsuit-Against-Block-Inc-formerly-Square-Inc.html">suing Block</a> for trademark infringement, with the name, a block in its logo, and a green color scheme that all come a little too close to home, since H&amp;R Block, best known for tax filing prep, also happens to sell accounting services to SMBs, mobile banking to consumers and other fintech services just like Square’s… I mean, Block’s. Hard to guess which blockhead will back down first/move to settle here.</p>

<p>Mr. Musk perhaps said it best when he played a doctor in the Gen Z Hospital skit: “You all might want to sit down, what I have to say might be a little cringe.” Elon may have hoodwinked a substantial part of the population of global fanboys hoping to get rich on his coattails, but at the end of the day this couldn’t hold any water on Saturday Night Live. He’s not an actor, and he’s not that funny, so even with the wattage of being one of the world’s richest men and a major celeb on social media, his SNL hosting was… a smug, wooden, boring, awkward dud. You’re left wondering how/why he was anointed to be in the limelight in the first place (but then again, I wonder that about him most of the time).</p>
<h3>How do you do, fellow NFT owners</h3>

<p>The gold rush over NFTs caused some otherwise smart people to attempt to implement them in regrettable ways. Numerous companies announced NFT-adjacent projects, like using them to tokenize fanfic, in-game items, Discord things(?), and so on. After failing to read the internet in general’s skepticism of this interesting but at present highly dubious tech, the companies backpedaled madly, sometimes within hours of announcements or rumors. Literally anyone would have said it was a bad idea, try asking next time!</p>
<h3>Bezos thanks everyone for their money, which he shot into space</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2180039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180039" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180039" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joe Raedle / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The relentless self-congratulatory fanfare around Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first &#8220;real&#8221; trips to space was extremely tiring. While there was some relief in Branson&#8217;s company getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/virgin-galactic-is-clear-to-fly-again-following-faas-mishap-investigation-of-branson-flight/">grounded for shady maneuvers</a>, and in Bezos eliciting scorn for his tamales and his giant hat, the chef&#8217;s-kiss moment was the latter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/bezos-and-crew-host-a-giddy-press-conference-after-blue-origins-inaugural-crewed-launch/">tone-deaf thanks</a> offered to the world that financed his ego trip by shopping at his ethically bankrupt mega-corporation. &#8220;I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure he meant every word, which is why it&#8217;s so bad. (Also pity the poor cowboy hat, which Bezos has definitely also ruined for me.)</p>
<h3>Blue Origin whining postpones the next Moon landing</h3>
<p>After losing big time on the Human Landing System contract to arch-rival SpaceX, Blue Origin sued NASA, alleging impropriety. Its claims were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">dismissed in a highly embarrassing manner</a> (NASA basically pantsed the company in front of the entire industry) but the necessary rigmarole resulted in the planned 2024 crewed lunar landing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">being pushed out to 2025</a>. To be fair, we all suspected this would be the case anyway, but Blue presented itself as a perfect scapegoat. The blunder may have permanently tainted relations with NASA, which isn’t great when they’re pretty much Blue Origin’s only source of real money… other than “every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer,” of course.</p>
<h3>OnlyFans bans itself</h3>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ukHvXhN1UD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans bans explicit content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans bans explicit content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/embed/#?secret=ukHvXhN1UD" data-secret="ukHvXhN1UD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We all know what OnlyFans is for, and it&#8217;s been great seeing a platform where sex workers, among others, can monetize themselves. Until that platform abruptly announced that the people who&#8217;d made it rich in the first place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">were henceforth banned</a>. Bye, good luck! The backlash was so severe that the decision, unconvincingly blamed on prudish bankers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">was reversed within a week</a>. Don&#8217;t bite the hand that feeds you, people. (Unless the hand consents as part of a healthy fantasy.)</p>
<h3>From the desk of Donald J. Trump</h3>
<p>Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">tempestuous relationship with social media</a> is perhaps too serious a matter to treat of here, but one aspect of it deserves a palm to the face, and that&#8217;s his short-lived &#8220;social&#8221; platform, From The Desk of Donald J. Trump. This barebones microblog appeared after his ouster from every major social media network, but it was so minimally functional and got so little traffic that it only lasted a month or so before being mothballed. No doubt so his media team could focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">borrowing Mastodon&#8217;s code</a> for the follow-up, Truth Social. But even <i>that</i> was all just preliminary to the desperate-looking pitch deck and SPAC we would receive later in the year. As they say, if at first you fail badly, fail, fail again.</p>
<h3>Senator Blumenthal asks Facebook rep to “commit to ending finsta”</h3>
<p>Now known as the Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen leaked thousands of internal documents from her former employer, including some showing that Instagram is aware of its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">adverse effect</a> on teenage girls. Soon after, Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis was summoned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">testify before the Senate</a> about children’s internet safety.</p>
<p>Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a 75-year-old, was worried about young people using secret accounts that they hid from their parents.</p>
<p>“Will you commit to ending finsta?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Senator, let me explain. We don’t actually <i>do</i> finsta. What finsta refers to is young people setting up accounts where they may want to have more privacy,” Davis patiently replied.</p>

<h3>Facebook’s leaked benefits enrollment video</h3>
<p>It must be hard to work at Facebook – or, as it’s called now, Meta – on days when the company is getting loads of bad press for, you know, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/business/january-6-insurrection-facebook-papers/index.html">not doing enough</a> to stop the January 6 insurrection. But it’s also probably hard to work at Facebook when you have to enroll in your benefits.</p>
<p>There’s some pretty awful stuff detailed in the files that Haugen leaked, but if you want to experience some lower-stakes incredulity at our Metaverse overlords, check out this video. I’m sure Facebook has good benefits – they’re a huge, trillion-dollar tech company, after all – but is the subsidized care even worth it when there’s <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/leak-this-internal-facebook-benefits-video-may-be-its-greatest-crime">choreographed dancing</a> involved?</p>
<h3>NFTs aren’t even good at gatekeeping</h3>
<p>Bored Apes Yacht Club is like a fraternity for people who love Coinbase. Instead of paying dues to join an exclusive Greek society of bros, you can buy a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-a-300k-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-was-accidentally-sold-for-3k/">52 ETH</a> (~$210,000 at time of publication) NFT of an ape to be part of a cool club. Yes, Jimmy Fallon, Steph Curry and Post Malone are Yacht Club members – just like how some B-list actor was in your college’s fraternity twenty years before you were born. But it’s not just about the ape – the value of the NFT is that you get access to fancy events and stuff. So, nightlife journalist Adlan Jackson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york">concocted a clever plan</a> to sneak into a Bored Apes party.</p>
<p>As it turned out, a friend’s boss owned an Ape and sent Jackson a screenshot of a QR code that could get them into the party. The bouncers were checking for some wristband from a previous event, though, not the literal NFT, so he was turned away despite his Ape possession. Later in the night, Jackson tried to get in again, and… they simply let him in. No wristband, no NFT, no nothing. So much for exclusivity! Luckily, Jackson was just in time to see The Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas ask on stage, “This is kind of about art, right? NFTs? I don’t know, what the hell. All I know is… a lot of dudes here tonight.”</p>
<h3>Please make it stop</h3>

<p>If NFTs are now blowing up in the speculation bubble that is financial social media (how does that not have a short name? FiSo?) they owe a lot to Gamestop, the memestock that could. The company could have headed into oblivion like so many other mediocre retailers crowded out by innovations in technology, consumer habits and changing tastes in entertainment. But instead, it was picked up and carried on the wings of a wave of hype that drove its price into the stratosphere, leading to so, so many questions about who gets to be the gatekeeper in the world of trading, who makes money, and who are the biggest losers. You hate to see people getting manipulated, but also understand why those who bought in hated to be treated like unempowered peons. No one gets covered in glory in this one. But amazing, there has yet to be a final chapter in this saga: the stock is lower compared to January’s stratospheric peak, but it’s<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"> not that far off</a>.</p>
<h3>Spotify Wrapped is cheugy</h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we know that sharing your Spotify Wrapped round-up is basically just doing free PR for Spotify. But the copywriting on Wrapped read like it was penned by a forty-year-old communications staffer who asked his niece for some phrases that gen-Zers like.Spotify even hired an aura reader named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysticmichaela/">Mystic Michaela</a> to collaborate with them on generating audio auras. The result? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html">Cheugy</a>.</p>
<p>“There was one podcast that lived in your head, rent-free, all year long,” it said.</p>
<p>“You always understood the assignment.”</p>
<p>“While everyone else was trying to figure out what NFTs were, you had one song on repeat.”</p>
<p>“You deserve a playlist as long as your skincare routine.”</p>

<h3>Elizabeth Holmes has stans</h3>
<p>Former Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was on trial for criminal fraud for over four months this year. But on the first day of the trial, some fans – yes, fans – showed up dressed as Elizabeth Holmes. If you’re blonde, it’s a pretty easy costume – just wear a black turtleneck and some red lipstick, put your hair in a low ponytail, and there you go! You’re ready for the Halloween party!</p>
<p>But these cosplayers were legit, as far as the reporters who talked to them could tell. They really admired Elizabeth Holmes, despite the fact that she may or may not be guilty of serious criminal fraud charges running a company that actively jeopardized people’s health by giving them false blood test results. But to each their own.</p>

<h3>Even LinkedIn wants to be like TikTok</h3>
<p>Basically every social or entertainment platform is finding a way to wedge in a vertically-oriented short form video feed. It makes sense for direct TikTok competitors like Instagram or Snapchat to do this, even though it feels very inorganic and derivative. But toward the end of the year, even companies like Netflix, Spotify, Reddit, Twitter and Pinterest were trying it out. In 2022, Linkedin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/">plans to join them</a>.</p>
<p>The professional networking platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/">tried doing stories</a> this year, but it wasn’t as successful as Instagram at integrating that Snapchat copy-cat feature.</p>
<h3>Fleets fly away</h3>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is shutting down Fleets on August 3, citing low usage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/embed/#?secret=29czuz9uM3" data-secret="29czuz9uM3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then again, Twitter didn’t do so hot with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Fleets</a> either. I guess you could have seen the writing on the wall with this one: Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/">basically sealed Fleets’ fate</a> with its very name. Its own attempt to throw a hat into the short, ephemeral videos never quite struck a note with Twitter users, who mainly love the format precisely for what it does <i>differently</i> from the rest of social media: fast-paced, short punctuations of words and pictures that flutter down from each other with biting humor, searing criticism, perfectly-timed factoids and occasional glimpses of greatness, regardless of your follow numbers. Who really needs another Story format? Especially one launching so late in the day, with no great twist or even easy way to be used?</p>
<h3>Instagram forgot to turn on teen safety features on the web</h3>
<p>In July, Instagram tried to cover its metaphorical ass when it comes to user safety by rolling out some new features. One feature made it so that any new account from a user under 16 would default to private. But Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) put tech journalists to shame by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">unearthing a scoop</a> that was right in front of our eyes for months. If a teen made an Instagram account on the web, it defaulted to public.</p>
<p>To be fair, who even uses Instagram for the web? Still, this felt like a pretty big oversight. Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri had to admit under oath that his team messed up. It was pretty cringe, but at the same time, it’s an alarming, lackadaisical error for a company that’s been repeatedly defending its commitment to teen safety in the Senate this fall.</p>
<h3>The headline of this article</h3>
<p>It was Devin&#8217;s idea. Amanda enthusiastically approved. Still cheugy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to two founders and two investors to nail down the top tips for New Zealand founders looking to put their mark on the markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Zealand, a country of 5 million people in the South Pacific, has witnessed a shifting tech startup landscape over the last couple of years. While some major global companies like Xero, Rocket Lab, LanzaTech and Seequent have shined a spotlight on New Zealand&#8217;s startup scene, the country historically hasn&#8217;t had access to much venture capital.</p>
<p>As a country with an economy that primarily exports agricultural products, the New Zealand startup world has usually relied on funding from a community of high-net-worth individuals and family offices who probably made their millions through real estate or farming.</p>
<p>In March last year, the New Zealand government launched Elevate, an NZD $300 million fund of funds program that&#8217;s been providing millions to local VCs to invest into the startup community to fill the early-stage capital gap. At the same time, foreign investors have been flooding onto the scene, attracted to the small country that has a reputation for producing great companies. Founders and VCs in New Zealand are hopeful that the increase in funding from multiple sources is a signal that technology might just become the country&#8217;s next big industry.</p>
<p>That is, if the momentum that has led to more early-stage capital continues.</p>
<p>We spoke to two founders (Peter Beck of Rocket Lab and Cecilia Robinson of Au Pair Link, My Food Bag and Tend) as well as two investors (Phoebe Harrop, principal at Blackbird Ventures, and Robbie Paul, CEO of Icehouse Ventures) to nail down the top tips for New Zealand founders looking to put their mark on the markets. Here&#8217;s what we learned.</p>
<h2>Think big and back yourself</h2>
<p>New Zealanders typically tend to have an introspective view, failing to think big and globally from day one, Beck said. This is in part due to the fact that Kiwis grow up in a culture that suffers from &#8220;tall poppy syndrome,&#8221; a phenomenon where people who have achieved any measure of success are derided, cut down or sabotaged. As a result, not many people want to be a tall poppy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Play the Kiwi card. New Zealand sits favorably on the minds of the international community.							<cite>Icehouse Ventures CEO Robbie Paul</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to build a company, it&#8217;s incredibly painful, it takes a lot of work,&#8221; Beck told TechCrunch. &#8220;Why would you waste your time building a little company? Let&#8217;s build a big company. So go after big problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to psych yourself up to tackle those big problems, don&#8217;t be too humble. New Zealand consistently punches above its weight and produces world-class entrepreneurs and tech startups, Paul said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back yourself and know you can win on a global stage,&#8221; Paul told TechCrunch. &#8220;While starting on a rock at the bottom of the world comes with challenges, there are plenty of advantages, too.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t get starry-eyed over a big check</h2>
<p>&#8220;Remember that the least valuable thing an investor ever gives you is their money,&#8221; said Beck. &#8220;As you think about building your business, how and where you want to go, make sure you utilize investors to help you get there. People get starry-eyed by the check and don&#8217;t really sit back and go, &#8216;Well, is this person actually strategic to me or not?'&#8221;</p>
<p>When Beck was building Rocket Lab, he was highly selective about the investors he brought in, saying the differentiating factor between investors is not their capital, but rather who they can call. For example, Khosla Ventures participated in Rocket Lab&#8217;s Series A round, which Beck said opened the door to another big VC, Bessemer, to invest, in a Series B. DCVC led the Series C, but by the time Rocket Lab got around to its Series D, Bessemer was paving the way to Greenspring, which is a limited partner (LP) of Bessemer. Sovereign wealth funds, where the real big checks come from, participated in the company&#8217;s E round, and they were LPs of Greenspring.</p>
<p>&#8220;So as your company continues to grow, there are larger and larger pools of capital that you can then go and attract, and if all you&#8217;ve got is John from Pakuranga, John doesn&#8217;t have the phone number and credibility to sovereign wealth funds,&#8221; said Beck. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about setting up the company so that when you want to do a bigger round, you can go and tap that venture capitalist&#8217;s LPs and then it can tap that LP&#8217;s LPs and ultimately end up in sovereign wealth funds or others that can write a $100 million check no problems at all. It&#8217;s a smooth path there, and where it&#8217;s tricky is when there&#8217;s no path or the path is truncated, and the challenge with New Zealand is even though there are some better quality venture capital firms in New Zealand, where are their relationships with LPs?&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I spent a chunk of yesterday morning rediscovering the big trends of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">CES 2012</a>. It’s a strange experience, examining so much technology that feels &#8212; at once &#8212; extremely dated and very recent. With 10 years between you and an event, the macro trends really take shape. Some items are a clear part of a continuum that brings us to the present day. Even more often, however, these things prove to be a kind of evolutionary dead end.</p>
<p>Even so, there’s a lot we can learn in the moment. CES is billed as a bellwether for the year to come. It also demonstrates how the tech world responds to largely global trends, in a one-stop shop. And let’s be real, there’s really one key global trend from the past couple of years that’s going to drive what happens at the show in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve received some pushback on our coverage of big-name drop-outs from the in-person portion of the event. To some degree, I understand &#8212; or at least can empathize with &#8212; the criticism of focusing coverage on COVID-fueled exits, rather than the manufacturer news tied to the event. To that I say, simply, we’ll be covering that, too, only we’ll be doing it next week when it’s actually announced at the show (albeit remotely).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the lead up to the show, however, we can identify/predict the industry trends that are best poised to define CES &#8212; and, perhaps by extension, 2022.</p>
<p>First, the elephant in the room.</p>
<h3>CES drop-outs</h3>
<p>As I write this the list of big-name tech companies that have announced they will be opting out of (or dramatically scaling back from) in-person events includes: GM, Google, Microsoft, AMD, OnePlus, MSI, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Mercedes, BMW, Panasonic, IBM, TikTok and Pinterest. The media side includes TechCrunch, Engadget, The Verge, CNET, PCMag, Tom’s Guide, Tech Radar and more.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a full list &#8212; but it’s surely a lot more than the CTA hoped for. There are, however, still some big names participating, including Samsung, Sony, LG and Qualcomm. Given the late stage at which many companies opted out, those who attend the show are due for a surreal experience, full of big-name, unstaffed booths.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CES dodged the shutdown bullet in 2020 by the skin of its teeth. 2021, meanwhile, felt like a referendum on whether a hardware event at this scale can go entirely virtual. Based on our own experiences of navigating the show online, the answer was decidedly a no. With the CTA planning a return to an in-person event for 2022, I will be interested to see whether the organization has dramatically improved the experience for those who won’t be in Vegas.</p>
<h3>Connected fitness</h3>
<p>The last few years have been huge for this category &#8212; for what should be obvious reasons. Mirror was acquired by Lulu Lemon, Peloton had a banner couple of years (in spite of numerous setbacks) and the funding flowed for a range of different home fitness suppliers. This was fueled by widespread gym closures, coupled with the general inactivity of those forced to stay at home.</p>
<p>There’s been some regression for companies as gyms have reopened in different parts of the country and world, but with the arrival of troubling variants like delta and omicron, many have remained committed to their home workout routines.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Expect more startups trying new wearable form factors, including rings, after Oura proved out success on that side. Mindfulness and sleep will also be focuses, in addition to more traditional health tracking.</p>
<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>As someone who writes a lot about robots, it’s heartening to see them playing an increasingly important role at CES. That includes moving beyond sheer novelty and tried and true form factors like robot vacuums. My list includes exoskeletons, elder tech, agtech, prosthesis and &#8212; at the very top &#8212; disinfecting robots. There are going to be a TON of these, driven by an increased focus on surface-based disease transmission during the pandemic and the fact that it’s reasonably simple to mount UV-C light panels to an autonomous robot that can take laps around an office.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> With last-mile delivery robots taking off in a big way, expect to see a number of newer companies getting in on the act during the show.</p>
<h3>Lidar</h3>
<p>Okay, so Velodyne has opted out of the in-person event, but between robotics, self-driving cars and drones (among others) the demand for lidar is massive. Expect to see a lot of new offers from companies at the show &#8212; both new and old.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> It’s going to be a big year for e-bikes, too. Mark my words.</p>
<h3>Remote work</h3>
<p>This one’s a bit nebulous, I confess, but the pandemic had a profound impact on the category. After years of decline, PC and tablet sales shot up, as people scrambled to build home offices. Even after nearly two years in isolation, there’s still a lot that needs improving with our home setups. If you started building solutions like webcams, lighting, conferencing devices and microphones at the beginning of the pandemic, CES 2022 would be a great place to debut them &#8212; for many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> For the (large number)th year in a row, smart home stuff will occupy a huge portion of mindshare for the show.</p>
<p>CES 2022 kicks off next week. We’ll be there (virtually), so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>As is tradition on the show, we used the last episode of the year to make predictions about the next year. To continue an annual tradition,<a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall"> Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> joined <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> on the mic, a rare treat and one simply for your enjoyment. Expectedly, they had a lot to say.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248038" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So what did we manifest for 2022? Here&#8217;s a sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We&#8217;re bullish on climate-focused startups:</strong> A notable theme from a number of us was the importance of climate startups, and how many types of startups are going to have a climate-flavor. In short, as the planet changes, it&#8217;s going to touch just about everything. And if sustainability is not your entire pitch, it&#8217;s going to be at least a strategy soon enough.</li>
<li><strong>We had a <em>lot</em> to say about crypto:</strong> Sure, we&#8217;re all a bit tired of talking crypto, but there&#8217;s also no chance that we could get away from the topic when considering next year. The classic tension between reinvention and regulation continues to be a dynamic we all care about, and predict will be full force over the next twelve months.</li>
<li><strong>We&#8217;re not nearly as bullish on media:</strong> The Buzzfeed SPAC had some of us bummed out, but when it came to creators and not just writers, we were a bit more positive. Everything is media, even if everything doesn&#8217;t make money.</li>
<li><strong>Space is controversial:</strong> We won&#8217;t spoil it, but the space chat got a bit spicy. The argument wound up showing an interesting issue in the tech space, namely is all the money going to where it will have the greatest impact?</li>
</ul>
<p>A big hug from the Equity team for your continued listenership this year. Thanks for sticking with us, and we&#8217;re back in a heartbeat with another year&#8217;s shows &#8211; some of which may even be in person!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian antitrust watchdog on Friday ordered an investigation into Apple&#8217;s business practices &#8212; in particular, the company mandating iPhone app developers to use a proprietary payments system &#8212; in India, where the American firm commands less than 2% of the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India, which ordered the Director General to conduct the probe within 60 days, said it is of the prima facie view that the mandatory use of Apple&#8217;s in-app payments system for paid apps and in-app purchases &#8220;restrict[s] the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice especially considering when it charges a commission of up to 30% for app purchases and in-app purchases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The watchdog began reviewing the case after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/report-india-may-be-next-in-line-to-mandate-changes-to-apples-in-app-payment-rules/">a complaint filed by Together We Fight Society</a>, a non-profit based in India&#8217;s western state of Rajasthan. The organization said Apple&#8217;s move, which prevents app developers from using a third-party or their own payments system, makes a significant dent in the revenues they generate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple had urged the CCI to dismiss the case, saying it was too small a player in India.</p>
<p>India is the latest nation to express concerns over Apple and Google requiring app developers to use the firm&#8217;s payments system for in-app purchases. (The Indian watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">opened the investigation</a> into Google&#8217;s business practices last year.) Earlier this year, South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">approved a measure</a> that makes it illegal for Apple and Google to make a commission by forcing developers to use their proprietary payments systems.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Fortnite-maker gaming firm Epic publicly challenged Google and Apple by introducing its own payments system in the sleeper hit title. Now it&#8217;s locked in legal battles with Google and Apple. This year, attorneys general from 36 U.S. states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google alleging its Google Play app store is an illegal monopoly. A bipartisan bill introduced this year in the U.S. Senate seeks to restrict how the Apple and Google app stores operate and what rules can be imposed on app developers.</p>
<p>The European Union last year proposed the Digital Markets Act, which is meant to prevent technology platforms from abusing their gatekeeper position.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At this stage, it appears that the lack of competitive constraint in the distribution of mobile apps is likely to affect the terms on which Apple provide[s] access to its App Store to the app developers, including the commission rates and terms that thwart certain app developers from using other in-app payment systems,&#8221; the CCI wrote Friday in a 20-page order.</p>
<p>The CCI said it is also worth probing whether Apple uses data it collects from the users of its competitors to &#8220;improve its own services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-india-q4-2020/">a considerable uptick in iPhone sales in India</a> in recent years, Apple is still a small player in the market. Google&#8217;s Android commands a marketshare that swings between 98 to 99% each year.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Apple for comment.</p>

<p>The push by countries at all levels of development to modernize their information and communications networks has created unprecedented demand for technological infrastructure. Governments and industry are investing billions of dollars to expand digital connectivity worldwide. New deployments of 4G, 5G, satellites and fiber-optic cables could create huge opportunities for host nations but pose significant risks if networks are built without adequate safeguards. The U.S. has a role to play in securing the future of the internet and the global digital economy but will need to move beyond confrontation with China to succeed.</p>
<h2>China’s network effects</h2>
<p>Digital access is the foundation for digital services, like fintech and e-commerce, that connect communities to trade and financial resources. As startups in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">Latin America</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/11/19/global-investment-money-is-flooding-into-africas-fintechs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> draw billions in investment, their services require a strong and wide-reaching information communications technology (ICT) backbone to flourish.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Due to <a href="https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/huawei-and-the-ambiguity-of-chinas-intelligence-and-counter-espionage-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal</a> <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obligations to the Chinese state</a> — including sharing customer data at its request — China’s tech firms cannot guarantee that they will put their clients first. Many firms also host <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-challenge-communist-corporate-governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal Party organizations</a> that influence decision-making. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is not omnipotent — some companies have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow-rolled compliance</a> with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/93451b98-da12-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information requests</a> — but the CPC’s ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">crackdown</a> on tech companies is diminishing their ability to circumvent directives.</p>
<p>But because network modernization is an economic imperative and Chinese firms often offer lower prices than their global competitors, many countries choose to source their technology despite these political and security hazards.</p>
<p>While the risks posed by companies such as Huawei are <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/c2b/c2b-log/whats-the-deal-with-huawei-and-this-african-union-headquarters-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not evidence</a> of collaboration with China’s government, these legal and institutional pressures, combined with engineers’ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-technicians-helped-african-governments-spy-on-political-opponents-11565793017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track record of spying</a> for other national governments, such as in Uganda and Zambia, suggest that even China’s most powerful ICT companies can be susceptible to co-option. As the digital economy grows and diversifies, more kinds of data, from personal communications to financial, business, health and other sensitive information will become vulnerable to a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/how-to-avoid-falling-into-chinas-data-trap/">data trap</a>.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While state intervention is not guaranteed, the CPC’s approach to foreign affairs heightens that likelihood. Beijing wants international audiences to accommodate its priorities and activities and pursues “<a href="https://www.hudson.org/research/17119-china-s-gambit-for-total-information-dominance-a-us-australia-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information dominance</a>” with that purpose in mind. Data is important for understanding the information environment and shaping perceptions of the CPC, so access to and influence over ICT infrastructure — the vehicle for modern communications — makes the companies that provide it pivotal to Chinese foreign policy.</p>
<p>Information dominance also means preference for CPC-friendly content and platforms, which hinders opportunities for local populations. For example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/23/business/startimes-china-africa-kenya-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarTimes</a>, a Beijing-based media company that upgraded and operates television networks in 30 African countries, received hundreds of millions of dollars from China’s EXIM Bank to enter African markets. It offers state-run media channels in its cheapest subscriptions or even for free which “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/07/china-plan-for-global-media-dominance-propaganda-xi-jinping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tell the China story well</a>” to local audiences, at the cost of excluding bandwidth dedicated to local perspectives or media free from CPC propaganda.</p>
<h2>America’s response: Still loading</h2>
<p>In response to the spread of China’s network projects, U.S. policymakers have begun to tackle vendor security assessments and expand government mechanisms to finance ICT. Buried under the Trump administration’s “us or China” rhetoric, the State Department’s <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/the-clean-network/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Network</a> initiative included <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/200511_Lewis_5G_v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country-agnostic criteria</a> for assessing vendor-based cyber risks and support for the multilateral <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/PRG_proposals_SP_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prague Proposals</a>, which underscored non-technical aspects of 5G security. The administration also retooled the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/04/belt-and-road-initiative-bri-build-back-better-us-china-competition-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. International Development Finance Corporation</a> (DFC) to better support digital modernization and network construction. In an early victory for DFC, Ethiopia selected a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-tech-fight-opens-new-front-in-ethiopia-11621695273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone-led group</a> in lieu of a bid linked to China’s Silk Road Fund, despite long-standing relationships with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579212092223818288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei and ZTE</a> to supply telecommunications.</p>
<p>These developments highlight the U.S. commitment to generating alternatives, in collaboration with other countries. But these measures alone may be insufficient to address the scale of China’s approach. In addition to vast government investments into overseas projects, China has subsidized its tech giants to such an extent that Huawei once proposed a 5G project at “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-huawei-the-5g-play-is-in-europe--and-the-us-is-pushing-hard-for-a-ban-there/2019/05/28/582a8ff6-78d4-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a price that wouldn’t even cover the cost of parts</a>.”</p>
<p>The United States, while motivated to offset China’s influence, should not look to outspend it or mimic its approach. Instead, U.S. leadership should mobilize a variety of sustainable investments, find technology solutions to make tech adoption cheaper and pitch neutral infrastructure that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/to-protect-the-future-of-the-internet-us-led-tech-diplomacy-must-change-tack/">offer equitable opportunities</a> for local economies.</p>
<p>The White House should spearhead creation of a <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/edge-networks-core-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multilateral digital development bank</a> to make more resources available to states looking to modernize their networks. Doing so would also add heft to commitments the Biden administration has made under the G7’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-launch-build-back-better-world-b3w-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build Back Better World</a> initiative.</p>
<p>In coordination with Congress, the Biden administration should also back efforts to lower the cost of equipment itself to sustainably compete with China’s low-priced kit. One solution is interoperability in technology standards; <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/open-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open RAN</a> for 5G networks is one example of how this approach has already proven <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wireless-networks-dish-rakuten-cloud-11634000875?mod=tech_lead_pos12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less expensive</a> than traditional network architecture.</p>
<p>Another avenue to lower costs is to invest in research and development for <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/edge-networks-core-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network technologies</a> that can replace the most expensive legacy components. For example, fiber-optic cables are expensive to deploy on land; workarounds may include wireless optic solutions or integration of satellite mesh networks with terrestrial systems.</p>
<p>Finally, the White House should explore ways to integrate <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net neutrality</a> principles into network financing projects run by agencies such as DFC. Net neutrality could offer economic benefits to host nations by keeping the digital playing field open for local media and innovation. Neutral networks would set the foundation for a third way forward from what has been criticized as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-digital-colonialism-espionage-silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital colonization</a> by China’s government and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar criticisms</a> of the U.S. private sector.</p>
<p>A digital network is ultimately a means to an end: infrastructure for interpersonal communications, content, services, industry and innovation. While few countries, at least for now, supply ICT infrastructure to the majority of the world, that majority should have full access to the opportunities it can offer. A revised route to digital modernization, premised on open participation, can not only offset the local costs of China’s cyber and influence power, but pave the way for an equitable internet for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In late March last year, as the virus started to spread across India, investors began to worry about the impact a potential pandemic could have on their portfolio firms.</p>
<p>They exchanged notes, and on April 1, penned a joint open letter to the local startup ecosystem, advising firms to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/investors-tell-indian-startups-to-prepare-for-the-worst-as-covid-19-uncertainty-continues/">prepare for the worst</a>.”</p>
<p>In the months that followed, the virus engulfed the South Asian market and, among other things, hit the brakes on funding activity. Scrambling to steer through the unprecedented event, startups began to cut expenses. Some didn’t survive, and a few got acquired in fire sales. Many entrepreneurs and investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">stepped up and volunteered</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/investors-startup-founders-in-india-pool-13m-to-fund-projects-that-fight-coronavirus/">help the nation fight the pandemic, too</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Investors were right about the impact the virus would have on the country, and by extension, on the firms attempting to fuel the economy. But very few were prepared for what was about to happen in just a few quarters.</p>
<p>Scores of startups, many operating in edtech and fintech categories, began to report fast growth. “We started to see three years and five years of growth in one year,” said Ashish Dave, chief executive of Mirae Asset Venture’s India business.</p>
<p>While several investors, including many tier 1 funds that are generally very active in India, were still cautious, a group of investors including Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital, and SoftBank shifted into a higher gear.</p>
<p>Navroz Udwadia of Alpha Wave Global (formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital) said in a conference earlier this year that his firm likes to get aggressive when most other funds are cautious about the market conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">backed Infra.Market in February this year</a>, propelling the business-to-business e-commerce platform’s valuation from $200 million to over $1 billion in a span of two months.</p>
<p>In a letter to investors in February, Tiger Global said the opportunity it sees in areas such as consumer, enterprise, and financial technology in the U.S., China, and India is “very large relative to the amount of capital we manage and evolving at a rate that is often hard to comprehend.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-2252298 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="270" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=768,305 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=680,270 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Several factors worked in India&#8217;s favor, many investors said. There’s an abundance of dry powder in the market and investors are increasingly looking at growth avenues such as emerging regions as their next big bets. It also helped that Beijing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">enforced a series of crackdowns</a> on its own startups and made it difficult for foreign money to flow into China.</p>
<p>Another thing swinging in favor of India was the record number of IPOs that we saw this year. Food delivery firm Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar debut</a>. Fashion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/indian-fashion-e-commerce-nykaa-makes-stellar-market-debut/">commerce Nykaa</a>, online insurer PolicyBazaar also made strong debuts on the stock exchanges. Paytm filed for the nation&#8217;s largest IPO, though the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">public market is still giving it less valuation than it sought</a>.</p>
<p>Dave said Indian startups going public addressed the exit challenge that many investors have faced over the years.</p>
<p>The investors’ bullishness on India was on full display in April, when the virus was beginning to gain pace again in the country.</p>
<p>Eight Indian startups &#8212; including social commerce Meesho, fintech CRED, investment platform Groww, business-to-business messaging platform Gupshup, payments firm Chargebee &#8212; joined the unicorn club in April. Tiger minted five of these unicorns.</p>
<p>The sudden flow of cash also created a crunch for talent in the market. Startups began to offer lucrative stock options and salary hikes to employees to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">win and retain them</a>.</p>
<p>In total, capital flowing to private Indian startups surged over four times to about $39 billion this year and nearly three times from the previous best of $14.6 billion in 2019, according to data from insight platform Tracxn, which has also filed for an IPO.</p>
<p>India now has 81 unicorns, 44 of which joined the club this year. Several of the unicorns and many other fast growing startups have raised multiple rounds this year and increased their valuations multiple times over. Fintech <a href="http://sliceit.com/">Slice</a>, which is giving millions of Indians access to credit card features and helping them build credit scores, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">increased its valuation multiple-fold</a> in a recent round it raised from Insight Partners and Tiger Global.</p>
<p>CRED, for instance, has raised three funding rounds and has held talks for a fourth one, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/indian-fintech-cred-seeks-funds-at-5-5-billion-valuation/">TechCrunch reported earlier</a>. Indian edtech giant Byju&#8217;s has raised over $1.5 billion since last year. Instant grocery delivery startup Zepto, co-founded by two 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, doubled its valuation to $570 million in a span of two months.</p>
<p>Fintech startup <a href="https://www.myjar.app">Jar</a>, which is helping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tribe-and-arkam-back-jar-app-to-help-millions-in-india-start-their-savings-journey/">hundreds of thousands of Indians start their investment journey</a>, is about to close a round from a high-profile investor, said two people familiar with the matter. The startup, founded this year, is likely to increase its valuation by about 15 times in the new round.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.questbook.app">QuestBook</a>, which is helping developers transition to web3, is about to close a round from a number of investors including entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, according to a person familiar with the matter. Polygon is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/vcs-eye-investment-in-polygon/">talks to raise from Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital</a>, TechCrunch reported this month. (Also Amazon is in talks to back an agritech startup, per two people familiar with the matter.)</p>
<p>Ramakant Sharma, founder of Livspace, is working on a crypto startup called &#8220;TheSpiderMan,&#8221; according to three people familiar with the matter and investor deck reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Startups have become mainstream in India,” said Dave, pointing to a number of recent developments including the arrival of Shark Tank in the country. “Indian parents are no longer hesitant to tell their friends that their kid works at a startup or has founded one. Everyone now knows what a startup is. For years, I had to explain to my dad what I do for a living!”</p>
<p>Tiger Global, which has made over 50 investments in India this year, is currently conducting due diligence to back an additional nine startups in the country, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank and Alpha Wave Global have also deployed serious capital in the country. SoftBank has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">invested over $3 billion in India this year</a>, whereas Alpha Wave Global has poured over $2 billion.</p>
<p>The frenetic pace at which some of these firms have written checks to Indian startups this year has also forced many of their global peers to take India more seriously. Temasek, which typically backs late stage startups, has made a record 20 investments in India this year.</p>
<p>Insight Partners, which became more prolific in India this year, made some changes to its investment process in the country to speed up the time it takes to back a startup, two people familiar with the matter said. It’s currently engaging to back Indian NFT platform Faze, according to two people with knowledge of those proceedings.</p>
<p>General Catalyst is building a team in India, too. The firm is also in talks to back a number of startups including OneCode, a person familiar with the matter said. Andreessen Horowitz made its first investment in India this year. B Capital Group has also appointed a new India head.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-2252299 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="269" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>“Tiger has changed the game,” said Dave. “Every fund on the planet has at some point relooked and reassessed their strategy and tried to figure out what is the best they can do. Not everyone can play Tiger’s game. But what is the next best you can do? Because you can’t play the same game that you used to.”</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India, which has been investing in India for over a decade, remains the most prolific investor in India and Southeast Asia. It has made over 60 investments this year.</p>
<p>Dave said he expects the pace of investments to continue in the new year. “The market will continue to become more competitive. Just look at the number of people who are beginning to do angel investing.”</p>
<p>“Overseas, the market is huge. The number of investors and firms are also very large. That’s still not the case in India. So the competition for good deals is very high.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is often a mistaken impression that covering the enterprise is kind of dull when compared to the consumer side of the house, but having followed the space for a couple of decades now, I can tell you that nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>For one thing, there&#8217;s big money in the enterprise, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">Oracle buying Cerner</a> last week for $28 billion and shaking up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">the healthcare vertical</a> while they were at it, or UiPath going from obscure startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/">to $35 billion RPA juggernaut</a> earlier this year, before falling back a bit after going public.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s intrigue, like when activist investors try to force companies to make moves they normally wouldn&#8217;t want to make, and battles for control of the board like we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">at Box this year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s drama, like the three-year battle among the biggest enterprise cloud infrastructure companies in the world for the $10 billion Department of Defense <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pentagon-jedi-contract/">JEDI cloud contract</a>, a procurement process that had everything from lawsuits to repeated internal reviews to presidential interference.</p>
<p>So you can say a lot of things about the enterprise&#8230; but boring? Definitely not &#8212; and this year was no different. So I decided to close out 2021 with a look at five stories that rocked the enterprise. It&#8217;s hard to narrow 12 months of news down to the five biggest stories, but here are my choices.</p>
<h2>The Bezos-Jassy-Selipsky musical chairs at Amazon</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news this year involved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Jeff Bezos deciding to step back</a> as CEO, taking on the chairman role. Now that in itself did not have a huge enterprise impact because Amazon is an e-commerce company, which doesn&#8217;t necessarily fall within my purview, but then there was what happened next.</p>
<p>That February day when Bezos made his announcement, he also indicated he had chosen his replacement, Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy. He had helped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">build the cloud infrastructure business at Amazon</a> into a massive business, surpassing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">a $64 billion run rate</a> in the most recent quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Replacing him wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but they turned to an old friend when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">they hired Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky</a> to take over for Jassy. Selipsky had previously been at AWS from its inception until 2016, when he left to take over Tableau. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/aws-reinvent-2021-was-more-incremental-than-innovative/">Now it&#8217;s his job</a> to keep the train moving. He has momentum in his favor, but competition is getting ever more fierce, and it bears watching what happens next year under Selipsky&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<h2>Bret Taylor&#8217;s totally excellent week</h2>
<p>One of the other top stories involved Salesforce executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/">Bret Taylor getting a couple of big jobs</a> in the same week at the end of November, making for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/3-analysts-break-down-bret-taylors-pretty-sweet-week/">a pretty sweet week for him</a>. For starters he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">named chairman of the board at Twitter</a>. If that weren&#8217;t enough, he was also named co-CEO at Salesforce, where he had moved rapidly up the ladder since his company, Quip was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">acquired in 2016</a> for $750 million.</p>
<p>While Twitter had turmoil of its own with long-time CEO Jack Dorsey stepping down and Parag Agrawal taking over, the move to co-CEO at the CRM giant was clearly the bigger news from an enterprise perspective. While <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforces-taylor-will-report-to-benioff-despite-co-ceo-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information reported</a> that Taylor would still be reporting to company co-founder, chairman and co-CEO Marc Benioff, the promotion put Taylor in line to be Benioff&#8217;s heir apparent should Benioff decide to step back into the chairman role in the same way that Bezos did earlier this year. Another storyline to consider in 2022 is whether Salesforce revisits its desire to buy Twitter,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/24/why-salesforce-might-be-interested-in-twitter/"> a move it thought of making in 2016</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/14/salesforce-officially-walks-away-from-twitter-acquisition-for-real-this-time/">walking away</a>.</p>
<h2>Box-Starboard Value proxy fight</h2>
<p>Box <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/box-wins-proxy-board-battle-with-activist-investor-starboard-value/">beat back an attempt</a> by activist investor Starboard Value <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">to take over the board</a>, a move that likely would have resulted in the removal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie</a>, the sale of the company, or both. It was the culmination of months of drama and it made it a major enterprise story line for 2021.</p>
<p>Starboard Value, an activist investor, bought<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/"> a 7.5% stake</a> in the cloud content management company in 2019, which would grow to 8.8%, giving the firm considerable influence over the company. They remained quiet for a time, but last year they decided to make a move and put Box on notice that they wanted to take over the board, which resulted in a proxy battle.</p>
<p>Along the way, Box answered with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">a $500 million investment from KKR</a>, further angering Starboard, filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">a document with the SEC</a> pushing back against Starboard&#8217;s slate of board candidates and issued their<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/box-reports-earnings-early-to-give-shareholders-time-to-review-financials-ahead-of-board-vote/"> earnings report early</a> to give voters a chance to see their latest results. As luck would have it, the company scored two decent quarters following Starboard&#8217;s action and easily won the proxy battle, leaving the status quo for now. What happens in 2022? As I wrote, perhaps it&#8217;s time for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/after-a-proxy-fight-victory-its-time-for-box-to-make-some-bold-moves/">Box to make some bold moves</a>, and use some of KKR&#8217;s money to buy some adjacent functionality.</p>
<h2>DoD kills JEDI and announces new cloud initiative</h2>
<p>The $10 billion, decade-long <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">JEDI cloud contract</a> has been drama-filled from the day it was announced in 2018. Over those years, I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pentagon-jedi-contract/">more than 30 articles</a> on it, so when the Pentagon decided<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/"> to kill it finally this year</a>, that was big news.</p>
<p>From the start, conventional wisdom said that it was Amazon&#8217;s contract to win. There were complaints that the RFP was written with Amazon in mind, but in the end it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">Microsoft that won the deal</a>. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazon-asks-judge-to-set-aside-microsofts-10b-dod-jedi-cloud-contract-win/">went to court</a> though, stating that the previous president had directly interfered with the procurement process because of his personal dislike for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also happens to own The Washington Post newspaper. Amazon also argued that it should have won on merit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it succeeded in convincing a judge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">to put the project on hold</a> in February 2020. It would never restart, and the DoD decided to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/pentagon-announces-new-cloud-initiative-to-replace-ill-fated-jedi-contract/"> move on to a new project</a> in July, stating that technology had changed since 2018 (which is true) and wisely deciding to go with a multi-vendor approach with its new initiative, instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/the-single-vendor-requirement-ultimately-doomed-the-dods-10b-jedi-cloud-contract/">of the winner-take-all approach</a> it had pursued with JEDI.</p>
<h2>Dell spins out VMware</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/dell-buys-emc-for-67b-in-largest-deal-in-tech-history/">Dell bought EMC in 2015</a> for $67 billion (later amended to $58 billion), it was the largest deal in tech history, and another doozy of a story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dell-emc-deal/">to follow and write about</a> over the years. VMware was always the crown jewel of the deal, and so enterprise reporters like me kept a close eye on what Dell was going to do with it. For a long time it stood pat, but it was a huge story in the early part of the year when it announced it was spinning out the company in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">a deal valued at $9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>It seemed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/should-dell-have-pursued-a-more-aggressive-debt-reduction-move-with-vmware/">a little light perhaps</a> given the amount of money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/unpacking-how-dells-debt-load-and-vmware-stake-could-come-together/">that&#8217;s still on the books</a> for the EMC deal. What happens next year? Could someone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/once-vmware-is-free-from-dell-who-might-fancy-buying-it/">make a run to acquire VMware</a> now that it&#8217;s free of Dell? Dell remains a major shareholder and still has plenty of debt left over from that EMC deal, so it is definitely something to watch in 2022.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s hard to choose just five because inevitably I&#8217;ve left out some worthy storylines. What would you have included? Leave a comment and let me know.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[We asked our staff to vote on their favorite stories of the year, added evergreen content and our top TC+ articles for a well-rounded 2021 list. Enjoy!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just when we thought things couldn’t get more unexpected than a pandemic that shut down the world in 2020, 2021 entered the chat.</p>
<p>As we started to navigate a “new normal,” we also started challenging the systems around us with advancements in crypto, web3, the metaverse and so much more.</p>
<p>When looking at our top-performing stories of the year, a lot stood out. Some stories were to be expected, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-launches-google-wave/">product launches</a> and major outages (ahem, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook</a>). Others were deep analyses and interviews on different sectors of the industry. It was hard to narrow down a top 10.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252058" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of spitting out a list of TechCrunch’s top-performing stories, we asked our staff to vote on their favorite stories of the year, added evergreen content and our top TC+ articles for a well-rounded 2021 list. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Staff picks</h2>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/eric-dean-wilson-interview/">Air conditioning is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century. It’s also killing the 21st</a></strong></p>
<p>What started as a small Twitter Spaces interview with about 180 listeners quickly (and very unexpectedly) turned into one of TechCrunch’s top-read stories of 2021. Danny’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/book-review/">book reviews</a> gained traction this year, but nothing piqued readers’ interests (see the comments for proof) quite like unpacking the modern-day air conditioner. Danny’s Spaces interview with Eric Dean Wilson focused on his book “After Cooling: On Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort,” exploring the before, during and after story of A/C — and how damaging the comforts of cold, clean indoor air can actually be.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/">OnlyFans’ porn ban is crypto’s opportunity of a lifetime</a></strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter erupted when OnlyFans announced its ban on “sexually explicit content” in mid-August in an attempt to comply with its investors and banks. At the time, the decision left creators feeling betrayed, and experts questioned if OnlyFans could even survive the transition. Although the decision has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">since been suspended</a>, the tech community’s immediate solution to the ongoing regulatory issues the porn industry faces was simple: crypto. For those of you new to the world of crypto, this real-world antidote will help you understand the “why” behind the push for cryptocurrencies. And for those of you well-versed on the topic, Lucas weighs both the opportunities and potential challenges crypto and porn face.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/elon-musk-said-it-was-not-a-flamethrower/">Elon Musk said it was &#8216;Not a Flamethrower&#8217;</a></strong></p>
<p>This is probably our “most 2021” headline. Many of us are — maybe a little too much — accustomed to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-shills-a-50-tesla-cyberwhistle-with-a-joke-about-whistleblowers/">Tesla CEO’s name in headlines</a> for wacky, meme-like behavior or commentary. But what makes this story interesting is the real-life dangers behind Musk’s money-spinning gag products. Musk sold a limited run of flamethrowers back in 2017 in an effort to raise awareness and funds for his startup, The Boring Company, which launched in 2016. However, Musk knew various countries had a ban on flamethrowers and thus labeled the product &#8220;Not a Flamethrower.&#8221; Problem solved? Not even close. TechCrunch contributor Mark Harris highlights an American who was incarcerated in Italy for the possession of Not a Flamethrower.</p>
<p><strong>4. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">Medium sees more employee exits after CEO publishes ‘culture memo’</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s safe to say this year brought much disruption to today’s corporate ecosystem. Not only are employees challenging work-life balance, the wealth gap and company culture, but they are also taking a stance on social and political initiatives. Natasha spoke with various former and current employees at Medium after CEO Ev Williams posted a &#8220;culture memo,&#8221; which ended up tripling churn at the company. However, after speaking to one engineer, Natasha found that there has been a long-standing “history of problematic issues at Medium, with a wave of departures that seem to be clearly triggered by the memo.” This article not only explores the downfall of Medium’s company culture but also how it relates to companies who sent out similar memos, like Coinbase and Basecamp.</p>
<p><strong>5. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TikTok just gave itself permission to collect biometric data on US users, including &#8216;faceprints and voiceprints&#8217;</a></strong></p>
<p>TikTok took off in the thick of the pandemic as many people in 2020 turned to the platform for their daily dose of viral videos, dances and trends while in quarantine. However, now more than ever, social media users are aware of data collection as growing concerns of privacy rights emerge. TikTok changed its privacy policy in June to allow the capture of users’ biometric data, which includes faceprints and voiceprints. At first glance, the new privacy policy is on par with many other social networks&#8217; use of data collection. But Sarah breaks down why the new policy is alarming, TikTok’s history with the U.S. government, past biometric privacy violation lawsuits and the policy update’s buggy rollout. This article is a good starting point for the ongoing data-privacy issues social media users face.</p>

<h2>Best evergreen</h2>
<p>With only a few days left in 2021, we looked back to see what we covered this year that we can continue to learn from in the future. NFTs aren’t going anywhere, yet, so that was at the top of our evergreen list, along with privacy laws, how Zoom effects your brain and how lessons in growth marketing from Cam Sinclair director of Ammo, a Perth-based growth marketing agency.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">If you haven’t followed NFTs, here’s why you should start</a></strong></p>
<p>This new(ish) wave of crypto has grown exponentially over the past year. When Cooper Turley wrote this article in February 2021, he said, “The estimated total value of crypto art has now passed $100 million according to cryptoart.io/data — just one vertical of a growing ecosystem of NFTs.” The estimated total value now, December 2021, is over $2 billion. If you don’t know much about NFT’s, this article is a great starting point.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">This tool tells you if NSO’s Pegasus spyware targeted your phone</a></strong></p>
<p>Are you concerned that your phone was targeted by NSO’s spyware? You probably shouldn’t be, but in July of 2021, a list was leaked that contained, “50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets was obtained by Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International and shared with the reporting consortium, including The Washington Post and The Guardian.” Zack writes about how Pegasus can be delivered and how you can tell if your phone has been targeted.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/new-york-city-biometrics-law/">New York City’s new biometrics privacy law takes effect</a></strong></p>
<p>In July of 2021, Zack also reported on a new biometric law taking effect in New York City. This law limits what businesses can do with the biometric data they collect. Zack says, “The move will give New Yorkers — and its millions of visitors each year — greater protections over how their biometric data is collected and used, while also serving to dissuade businesses from using technology that critics say is discriminatory and often doesn’t work.”</p>
<p><strong>4. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/this-is-your-brain-on-zoom/">This is your brain on Zoom</a></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been working from home, faces seen by colleagues on endless video chats, so it was great to read Devin Coldewey’s breakdown of a study Microsoft conducted about how your brain needs a break. When discussing the study, Devin says, “During the meeting block with no breaks, people showed higher levels of beta waves, which are associated with stress, anxiety and concentration.” Here’s to scheduling meeting breaks in 2022!</p>
<p><strong>5. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/australian-growth-marketing-agency-ammo-helps-startups-calibrate-their-efforts/">Australian growth marketing agency Ammo helps startups calibrate their efforts</a></strong> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><br />
TechCrunch Experts launched this year with the first focus being growth marketing. Anna Heim interviewed Cam Sinclair, Ammo’s director, and they talked about when companies are ready for growth marketing, mistakes to avoid when branding and more. Sinclair says, “At Ammo, we don’t measure time, we measure outcomes. At the start of every project we define what success looks like with the client. Every client is different, and we’re responsive to that.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is always a strange week &#8212; that liminal space between the Christmas holiday and New Year. Romjul &#8212; or “Dead Week” &#8212; as they call it in Norway (thanks Haje). It’s a time for quiet and reflection on the year that was for some &#8212; and CES embargoes for others. We’re currently focused on the latter, while trying to stay mindful of the former here at Actuator HQ.</p>
<p>We devoted much of the past few weeks to rounding up some of the year’s key trends in the space: delivery, warehouse/fulfillment and food prep. We’ve also spoken to a number of key people in the industry, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/raise-and-deliver/">CMU robotics head Matthew Johnson-Roberson and Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/every-day-is-boxing-day/">OpenRobotics CEO Brian Gerkey</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/dinner-is-servoed/">iRobot CEO Colin Angle</a>.</p>

<p>This week we’ve asked MIT CSAIL Director Daniela Rus to weigh in on the matter. She’s really gone above and beyond in her responses for this last Actuator of 2021, so I’m going to let her kick things off.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021?</strong> Regarding robotics and automation, the pandemic and subsequent labor shortages made it abundantly clear that there is a critical role for robots in the workplace. Industry has seen increased adoption of robots for manufacturing and logistics applications, where autonomy can deliver value, yet autonomy on the roadways in the form of a robotaxi is still a long way away. Research has made great strides on safer and more capable robots, with advancements in soft robot bodies and machine-learning powered robot brains.</p>
<p>In AI, we have seen heightened awareness about the challenges with today’s AI solutions. Industry has adopted many deep neural network applications that are enabling tools to augment work in a variety of fields. But it has also become clear that these methods require data availability, meaning massive data sets that have to be manually labeled and are not easily obtained in every field. The quality of that data needs to be very high, and if the data is biased or bad, the performance of the systems trained on this data will be equally bad. Furthermore, these systems are black boxes &#8212; there is no way for users of the systems to truly “learn” anything based on the AI’s innerworkings. There are also robustness problems as the trained models are often unstable, and we need to understand that the systems do not do “deep reasoning”, they mostly perform shallow pattern matching. The research community is working to address these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> As we move forward into our rapidly changing world, I believe that robots and AI can help us unlock our human potential, as individuals and as a collective. While the past 60 years have defined the field of industrial robots and empowered hard-bodied machines to execute complex assembly tasks in constrained industrial settings, the next sixty years will usher in robots in human-centric environments to assist humans with physical tasks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the industrial robots of the past 60 years have mostly been inspired by the human form, the next stage will be soft robots inspired by the animal kingdom: form and diversity modeled by our own built environment, with broad potential to mimic our natural state. While the industrial robots of the past 60 years are made of hard plastics and metal, I believe the next 60 years will bring us machines made of materials available to us naturally, or through engineered processes like wood, plastics, paper, ice or even food.</p>
<p>We will also see new ideas for AI, get more serious about AI and privacy, and address AI sustainability. It is important to remember that today’s greatest advances are due to decades-old ideas enhanced by vast amounts of data and computation. New technical ideas and funding to back them are needed to ensure progress. Additionally, we will understand more clearly the carbon footprint of machine learning and get more serious about Sustainable AI.</p>
<p>AI innovations can help optimize many of our activities to slow the impacts of warming: optimizing the electricity cost of technology, making transportation more efficient, monitoring and stopping deforestation, preserving biodiversity or ensuring there’s enough food to go around. But to do all that, AI systems must consume enormous amounts of energy. Current research estimates that training a large deep-learning model produces 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, equal to the lifetime emissions of five cars. We need to develop simpler models, which can drastically reduce the carbon footprint of AI.</p>
<p>The spread of robotics, automation and AI technologies has the potential to make people’s lives easier &#8212; but many of the roles that these technologies can play will displace work done by humans today. We will also focus efforts to anticipate and respond to the economic inequality this could create.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be impossible to top Professor Rus’ words this week, but I would like to cap the year off with a couple of items that highlight what’s happened in the industry over the past year and &#8212; perhaps &#8212; give us a glimpse of where things are going. I will echo what a lot of people have already said in the pages of Actuator: It’s been a remarkable year for robotics. After spending many years covering the space and hearing people prognosticate on the eventually of robotics, the pandemic has seen many begin to be put into practice faster than many predicted.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t think anyone was hoping that a pandemic would be how we got here, but, well, that’s how things go. And to echo Professor Rus’ statement, here’s hoping we’re able to address climate change concerns head on before it’s too late &#8212; and that we can address the inevitable displacement of human jobs. If we’re going to be deploying robots to improve the working conditions of some, it behooves us as a society to ensure that we’re able to support those whose jobs are made redundant as a result.</p>
<p>Roboticists will tell you about the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs they plan to replace, but there’s a far more difficult conversation around the impact that shift has on humans. It’s true right now that companies are having a difficult time filling roles &#8212; something automation can and will address. It’s also true that most of this technology is still in a collaborative stage that requires the involvement of human workers. But as the technology progresses and becomes more capable, is it invetible that we’re going to leave large swaths of the population behind because we’ve deemed the work they do as unskilled?</p>
<p>Looking at the trends for the past year, these are the key categories I’ve been following in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warehouse/fulfillment</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Food delivery/prep</li>
<li>Farming/agriculture</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Medical/surgical</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Construction</li>
</ul>
<p>And in some ways, that’s really just the start. For instance, a couple of weeks ago we covered Petra, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/">a drilling company that raised $30 million</a> to bore through solid rock for infrastructural projects. The list of fields robotics is set to disrupt is long and growing. As we look forward to 2022, let’s consider how we handle such things, going forward. I’m excited to continue discussing these and other issues in Actuator going forward. Next week, however, we’re going to get much more myopic and focus on the robots of CES.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the big robotics news has slowed down a bit this Romjul (I only get to use my new word like once a year, so I’m making the most of it). Rita has a great story for you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/meituan-food-drone-delivery-china/">about Meituan</a>, which is taking drone-based food delivery to Shenzhen. The Tencent-backed company has delivered 19,000 meals to 8,000 customers during its two-year pilot. As the piece notes, relatively lax regulations in the manufacturing hub are a big part of what brought it to Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Speaking of China, the country’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-lays-out-path-to-become-robotics-powerhouse-by-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped map out an ambitious five-year plan</a> aimed at increasing robotic adoption. That includes a planned 20% per year revenue increase, with a focus on manufacturing.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, and congrats on getting through this last one. Not everyone was so lucky. Here&#8217;s to sharing more robot news in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two more auto giants have added their names to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/">growing list of big companies</a> opting out of an in-person CES with less than a week remaining before kickoff. Yesterday, Mercedes confirmed that it would be skipping the physical event.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the health and safety of our customers, partners, employees and guests are our highest priority,” the company <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;Due to the large group of participants and the different country-specific regulations, a solid, safe and harmless planning for all participants is unfortunately not be feasible in the current situation. We deeply regret this decision but consider it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, BMW followed suit, issuing <a href="https://www.bmwusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=3878&amp;mid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a media release</a>, announcing a shift to a virtual press conference. The carmaker’s statement was short and sweet, noting, “For many years, the BMW Group has been presenting innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Due to the pandemic situation, the BMW Group will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully digital program livestreamed from Germany.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252222" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lidar company Velodyne, meanwhile, issued a full press release about its decision this week, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Velodyne Lidar will not participate in person at CES 2022 due to the surge in COVID-19 infection rates. The health and safety of employees, partners and the public are the topmost priorities for Velodyne and were the primary factors in the company’s decision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Early today, IBM also confirmed its decision to extract itself from the in-person event in a statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to the evolving COVID conditions, and out of an abundance of caution, IBM will not participate on-site at CES in Las Vegas this year. We look forward to participating in the event virtually.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also newly out is Panasonic, which had planned an in-person press conference for January 4. The company has shifted to a virtual event and will only <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a limited presence</a> at the show.</p>
<p>Those companies join GM, Google, Microsoft, AMD, OnePlus, MSI, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, Proctor &amp; Gamble, TikTok, Pinterest and a number of major media outlets, TechCrunch included. The decision to jump ship over mounting omicron concerns is likely an especially difficult one for startups, who rely on shows like CES to get noticed. I have, however, been contacted by a growing number of smaller companies who have made the difficult decision to stay home.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Over 2200 companies are confirmed to participate in person at CES 2022 in Las Vegas. Our focus remains on convening the tech industry and giving those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Consumer Technology Association &#8212; which runs CES &#8212; has stood firm in its plans to go ahead with the show, which starts January 5 (with media days on the 3 and 4).</p>
<p>“CES 2022 will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas,” the org said in a statement issued December 22. “Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.”</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, the Las Vegas Review Journal ran<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> an op-ed</a> from CTA head Gary Shapiro headlined “CES will and must go on in Las Vegas,” which accused media of “tell[ing] the story only through their lens of drama and big name companies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year was rife with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>. 2021 witnessed the attack on IT software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">Kaseya</a> that knocked 1,500 organizations offline, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/cd-projekt-red-hit-by-ransomware-attack-refuses-to-pay-ransom/">the CD Projekt Red hack</a> that saw threat actors make off with source code for games including Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3, and several high-profile attacks targeting big-name tech companies, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Olympus</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/fujifilm-becomes-the-latest-victim-of-a-network-crippling-ransomware-attack/">Fujitsu</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/panasonic-data-breach/">Panasonic</a>.</p>
<p>It was also the year that hackers seized global attention by targeting critical infrastructure, hacking American oil pipeline system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, meat-processing giant JBS and Iowa New Cooperative, an alliance of farmers that sells corn and soy, to name just a few.</p>
<p>After the attacks led to prolonged shutdowns, inflated oil prices and ran the risk of food shortages, the U.S. government began to take notice — after years of inaction — and scored some rare wins in what once seemed like an unwinnable battle against the ransomware epidemic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It began in April when the Department of Justice formed the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force. The move, which followed what the DOJ described as the “worst year” for ransomware attacks, aimed to prioritize the “disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity.” The task force declared its first victory two months later when the DOJ announced it had arrested 55-year-old Latvian national Alla Witte and charged her for her role in &#8220;a transnational cybercrime organization&#8221; that was behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/trickbot-spam-millions-emails/">TrickBot</a>, one of the most well-known and widely used banking trojans and ransomware tools.</p>
<p>An even bigger win came just days later when the DOJ announced it had seized $2.3 million in bitcoin that Colonial Pipeline paid to the DarkSide ransomware gang to reclaim its data. Since then, the U.S. government has offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/state-department-darkside-bounty/">a reward of up to $10 million</a> for information that helps identify or track down leaders of the notorious ransomware group.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against the Chatex cryptocurrency exchange for facilitating ransom transactions, just weeks after taking similar action against the Suex crypto exchange.</p>
<p>The biggest win for the Task Force came in October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/us-charges-kaseya-hacker-and-seizes-6m-from-revil-ransomware-gang/">with its disruption of the notorious REvil ransomware gang</a>. Prosecutors announced they had charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian national linked to the gang that orchestrated the July ransomware attack against Kaseya, and said it had seized more than $6 million in ransom tied to another member of the notorious ransomware group.</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s efforts to target ransomware groups this year were applauded by many, particularly for its tactic of following the money. Chainalysis, a provider of blockchain transaction analysis software, lauded the Treasury’s action against Suex as a “big win” against ransomware operators, telling TechCrunch that dismantling the mechanisms for ransomware groups to cash out their cryptocurrency would be vital in slowing them down. Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at SentinelOne, said that without removing the main incentive — financial gain — ransomware gangs will continue to operate and expand.</p>

<p>“Attackers will always have the advantage because they don’t have to follow the rules or the law. However, there are two approaches that could seriously impact the ability of transitional ransomware gangs to achieve their goals &#8212; removing the ability to use cryptocurrency for ransoms and machine speed responses to machine speed attacks,&#8221; said Wright.</p>
<p>The U.S. government also offered rewards for information on ransomware tactics, like the $10 million bounty for information on DarkSide, and the subsequent reward for intel on REvil. “With rewards this large, there’s a substantial incentive for these criminals to turn on one another. This action undermines trust across the ransomware as a service affiliate model,&#8221; Jake Williams, CTO at BreachQuest, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>But some believe that while the government&#8217;s actions have undoubtedly scared off some, it&#8217;s unlikely to disincentive ransomware gangs that continue to reap the financial rewards.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I applaud law enforcement efforts to bring those responsible for ransomware attacks to justice, the likelihood of apprehension and jail time simply does not outweigh the large sums of money being made by these criminal groups,&#8221; said Jonathan Trull at Qualys, an IT security company. &#8220;Unfortunately, the battle against ransomware is an asymmetric one, meaning there simply is not enough law enforcement resources globally to deal with the volumes and complexity of investigations needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright agreed, and was less than impressed by the U.S. government&#8217;s activity so far: &#8220;Arresting two people and recovering a few million dollars isn’t a victory over ransomware. This is more of a political statement to ’show’ something is being done about ransomware. $2.3 million isn’t even worthy of a rounding error when you look at the billions of dollars already lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, many believe that these tactics will unlikely be enough to fend off the growing threat of ransomware as we enter the new year, particularly as threat actors adapt their own. Experts believe that the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model — in which operators lease out their ransomware infrastructure to others in return for a percentage of the ransom proceeds — will continue to thrive in 2022, making it more difficult for law enforcement to track down operators.</p>
<p>Others expect multi-staged attack chains — the breaches that start with a phish and lead to data theft and eventually ransomware — to become more prevalent, which could enable hackers to infiltrate even the most well-protected network infrastructures.</p>
<p>The latter will likely lead to the U.S. government collaborating more closely with the private sector in 2022, according to Trull. &#8220;Law enforcement alone is not going to turn the tide, in my opinion. It will need to be a combination of enforcement actions paired with dedicated efforts to harden systems, develop, and operationalize backups of key data and systems, and effective response from the private sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s clear that more action is needed, the U.S. government is making progress. While a handful of prosecutions has been mocked by some, it&#8217;s clearly had an impact &#8212; particularly on ransomware groups&#8217; ability to advertise and recruit potential partners. In the wake of this unwanted attention, ransomware was banned from several popular hacking forums, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/fin7-fake-company-recruit-hacks/">one hacking group setting up a fake company</a> to lure unwitting IT specialists into supporting its continued expansion into the lucrative ransomware industry.</p>
<p>“Ransomware gangs are less welcome on certain cybercrime forums than they once were,&#8221; said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft.</p>
