										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are backing Koo, an Indian alternative to Twitter, with large size checks at a time when tension is brewing between the American social network and New Delhi.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said on Wednesday it has raised $30 million in a financing round led by Tiger Global Management. Mirae Asset, IIFL&#8217;s venture capital fund and existing investors 3one4 Capital, Blume Ventures, and Accel also participated in the round, which valued the Bangalore-based startup at over $100 million, up from about $25 million in February.</p>
<p>Like Twitter, <a href="http://kooapp.com">Koo app</a> allows users to publish posts in English and half a dozen Indian languages. Its interface, logo, and social sharing mechanism are strikingly similar to those of Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app has gained popularity in India in recent months following flare-ups between Twitter and the Indian government after the San Francisco-headquartered firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year.</p>
<p>(The Indian government, like Singapore&#8217;s, also ordered Twitter and Facebook last week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">take down posts</a> that identified a new variant of the coronavirus as &#8220;Indian variant&#8221;. Also last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians&#8217; tweets as manipulated media</a>. Earlier this week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to &#8220;serve a notice.&#8221;)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157509" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157509 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=768,673 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157509" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshots of Koo app</p></div></p>
<p>Several prominent government officials &#8212; including Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, Union Cabinet Minister Smriti Irani, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad &#8212; and many celebrities have signed up on Koo in recent months and urged their followers to follow suit.</p>
<p>Though the app &#8212; co-founded by Aprameya Radhakrishna (who also co-founded TaxiForSure, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold to local giant Ola</a>; and is a prolific angel investor) &#8212; has won the trust of investors, it is yet to gain ground.</p>
<p>Koo app, which was launched last year, had fewer than 6.5 million monthly active users in India in April, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>The startup says it aims to build a social network for the entire nation and not just a fraction of it. Twitter remains largely popular among users in urban cities in India.</p>
<p>Koo, whose initial traction has been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-koo-became-a-right-wing-darling-in-india/">credited to Hindu nationalists</a>, is currently one of the handful of social networks that has complied with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">India’s new IT rules</a> that grant New Delhi greater power to take down posts it deems offensive.</p>
<p>The revised IT rules, announced in February, would put an end to “double standards” by making platforms more accountable to the local law, government officials said then. Failure to comply might bereft social networks of safe harbor protection they enjoy.</p>
<p>The deadline to comply with the new rules expires on Wednesday. Facebook, which identifies India as its largest market, said it “aims to comply” with the new rules, while Google said in a statement that it “respects” India’s legislative process.</p>
<p>Koo is the latest investment from Tiger Global in India this year. The hedge fund, which has backed over 20 Indian unicorns, has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">most prolific investor in Indian startups in recent months</a>, winning founders with its pace of investment, check size, and favorable terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, has acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for $73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, has developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, which Smart Eye is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems — tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness — and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://corp.smarteye.se/en/press/press-releases/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-enters-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-affectiva-and-intends-to-raise-equity-in-a-directed-share-issue">terms of the deal</a>, $67.5 million will be paid with 2,354,668 new Smart Eye shares, of which 2,015,626 are to be issued upon closing of the transaction. The remaining 339,042 Smart Eye shares will be issued within two years of closing. About $6 million will be paid in cash once the deal closes in June 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Affectiva and Smart Eye were competitors. A meeting at the technology trade show CES in 2020 put the two companies on a path to merge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin and I realized like, wow, we are on a path to compete with each other — and wouldn&#8217;t it be so much better if we joined forces?&#8221; Affective co-founder and CEO Dr. Rana el Kaliouby said in an interview Tuesday. &#8220;By joining forces, we kind of check all the boxes for what the OEMs are looking for with interior sensing, we leapfrog the competition and we have an opportunity to do this better and faster than we could have done it on our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston-based Affectiva brings its emotion-detection software to the deal, which will allow Smart Eye to offer its existing automotive partners a variety of products. Smart Eye helps Affectiva move beyond the development and prototype work and into production contracts. Smart Eye has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM. Smart Eye, which has offices in Gothenburg, Detroit, Tokyo and Chongqing, China, also has a division that provides research organizations such as NASA with high-fidelity eye tracking systems for human factors research.</p>
<p>Smart Eye founder and CEO Martin Krantz said that European manufacturers building luxury and premium vehicles led the charge for driver monitoring systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the same pattern repeating itself now for interior sensing,&#8221; Krantz said. &#8220;I think a large part of the early contracts will be European premium OEMs such as Mercedes, BMW, Audi, JLR, Porsche.&#8221; Krantz added that there are a number of other premium brands it will target in other regions, including Cadillac and Lexus.</p>
<p>The opportunity will initially be in passenger vehicles driven by humans and will eventually expand as greater levels of automated driving enter the market.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which employs 100 people at its offices in Boston and Cairo, also has another business unit that applies its emotio-detection software to media analytics. This division, which will be part of the deal and will operate separately, is profitable, Kaliouby said, noting the software is used by 70% of the world&#8217;s largest advertisers to measure and understand emotional responses to media content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The social video tool <a href="http://promo.com/">Promo.com</a> just raised $16 million in a Series B round led by Getty Images, the company synonymous with stock imagery.</p>
<p>Brands, creators or whoever else might need some quick and dirty video content can search Promo.com for what they need, just like they would use a stock photography service. Getty offers its own library of stock videos as well, but Promo.com provides both the video clips and the tools for non-editors to craft a basic edit with a little bit of customization.</p>
<p>Brands can select an existing professional video clip from a library, plug in their own message and add a logo or custom audio. All that&#8217;s left is downloading the customized video and whisking it off to their social channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, one of the largest banks in Israel, also participated in the Series B round through debt financing. Promo.com&#8217;s existing &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; with Getty Images will deepen as part of the deal, giving the former company access to the latter&#8217;s expansive existing pool of video clips.</p>

<p>Of course, Promo.com isn&#8217;t the only show in town. Video creation platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/biteable-raises-7-million-series-a-for-its-template-based-online-video-builder/">Biteable</a> raised $7 million of its own in December, and similarly allows companies to make bright, bite-sized video content for social. The super streamlined<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/"> graphic design platform Canva</a> also supports video editing with its own library of stock images. Vimeo offers its own video template service too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/vimeos-new-app-helps-small-businesses-create-professional-social-videos/">known as Vimeo Create</a>, which grew out of the company&#8217;s acquisition of the AI-powered video editor Magisto.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Daily Crunch for May 25, 2021. Whether you are a developer, a startup fanatic or merely someone with wanderlust, we have something for everyone today. Well, except for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">disappointed investors in Lordstown Motors</a>. They are stuck holding the bag today after the American electric vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">announced a pretty awful set of earnings</a>.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us, there’s quite a lot of tech and startup news to enjoy. Let’s get to it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/"><strong>TechCrunch’s deep dive into Expensify continues</strong></a>: Ahead of its IPO, TechCrunch is digging into Expensify’s growth from startup to unicorn, with our latest entry discussing how the company shed its “Silicon Valley arrogance” to go global.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/"><strong>$300M for vertical farming</strong></a>: Startups shaking up the agricultural world is no longer a surprising idea, but the recent Bowery Farms round did make us sit up and take note. The company is now worth $2.3 billion, and its “vertically farmed produce is now available in 850 grocery stores.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/"><strong>Venture capital’s global march continues</strong></a>: New data from Africa indicates that the continent’s historically lagging venture capital results are making up for lost time. <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> reports that VC activity in Africa could reach “between $2.25 billion and $2.8 billion” this year. That would be a new record.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/"><strong>$26M for Airbyte, which is working to better connect data to where it’s needed</strong></a>: Having data is one thing, but startups are starting to get into not only <em>storing</em> data, but also how it gets ingested (Monte Carlo is working on that), and making sure it’s moved to where it’s needed. That’s where Airbyte comes in. And the company’s latest round comes just months after it raised a $5.6 million seed deal.</p>
<p>We asked our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> what induced him to cover the round. Here’s what he had to say: “What attracted me to this round was the fact that the founders were using open source to drive the development of a community of users, then worrying about monetization down the road.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/twilio-invests-in-adaptive-communications-platform-hyro/"><strong>Twilio opens wallet for Hyro</strong></a>: Whenever a company well known for leading a sea change in the tech world cuts a check, we tend to take notice. Recall when Salesforce was hip; its investments made waves. Today, Twilio is the BigCo in question, and Hyro the startup it is backing.</p>
<p>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, Hyro “calls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end users in a conversational way.” Very cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatnot-raises-50m-to-let-people-sell-pokemon-cards-funko-pops-and-more-via-livestream/"><strong>$50M for Whatnot, which wants to livestream e-commerce</strong></a>: Look, if you are not into buying things, Whatnot is not going to be your jam. But if you are, it has a neat take on e-commerce that is popular around the world, but has yet to take off in North America. Notably this round comes mere months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Whatnot raised $20 million</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/blockchain-startup-propy-plans-first-ever-auction-of-a-real-apartment-as-a-collectible-nft/"><strong>Something something real-life NFTs?</strong></a>: What happens when you cross a startup that wants to bring blockchain to the real estate market and NFTs? You get this: Propy. The startup in question, is “auctioning a real apartment as an NFT.” I don’t get it! But maybe that’s the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/security-startup-tessian-which-uses-ai-to-fight-social-engineering-trousers-65m/"><strong>$65M for social engineering-fighting Tessian</strong></a>: U.K.-based Tessian is a cybersecurity company, which means that of course it raised a huge new round. The cybersecurity market is hotter than all heck given <em>waves arms around at all the breaches lately.</em> But what makes Tessian neat is that it is taking on the human side of things by “flagging problematic [usage] patterns [that] could signify risky stuff is happening.”</p>
<h2>Brian Chesky describes a faster, nimbler post-pandemic Airbnb</h2>
<p>Managing Editor Jordan Crook interviewed Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world’s biggest hospitality startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it’s like driving a car. You can’t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes and expect nothing really bad to happen.</p>
<p>“Now imagine you’re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today was Microsoft’s Build conference, the second time that the annual Redmond developer confab took place virtually. But before we get into that, a short note on autonomous deliveries.</p>
<p>Getting stuff brought to your house without human power is a long-running technology dream. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/a-first-look-at-amazons-new-delivery-drone/">those Amazon drones</a> that everyone got super stoked about and then we never heard from again (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/amazon-asks-faa-for-permission-to-test-its-delivery-drones/">not once, but twice</a>)? Or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/postmates-robot-serve/">cute Postmates robot</a>? Well, there’s another set of players in the space, namely JD.com and Meituan. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/">the latest</a> on their self-driving delivery efforts.</p>
<p>Back to Build — oh boy was there a lot of news. From top to bottom, Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-brings-more-of-its-azure-services-to-any-kubernetes-cluster/">bringing more Azure services to Kubernetes</a>, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-gives-developers-new-tools-for-building-for-teams/">tools for developers building on top of Teams</a>, updates<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsofts-edge-browser-can-now-start-up-faster-and-put-your-tabs-to-sleep/"> to its Edge browser</a> as Internet Explorer shuffles off this mortal coil, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-azure-launches-pytorch-enterprise/">enterprise Azure support for PyTorch</a>, and, my personal favorite, the company is leveraging GPT-3 (which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">think is super cool</a>) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-uses-gpt-3-to-let-you-code-in-natural-language/">help people code in natural language</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be a Microsoft beat reporter. I kinda miss those days. It’s a huge company with a finger in nearly every pie, which makes covering it surprisingly horizontal. Regardless, enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">Frederic’s</a> coverage!</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Some of us have started traveling again &#8230; revenge travel, if you will. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a> chatted with Airbnb’s CEO and we asked him if he thinks “the trends we’re seeing in travel right now, like more rural destinations and decreased business travel, are here to stay?&#8221; See what he had to say <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/brian-chesky-describes-a-faster-nimbler-post-pandemic-airbnb/">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1397251091323031558">tell us what <em>you</em> think here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles bound for North American customers are being built without radar, fulfilling a desire by CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features.</p>
<p>Like many of Tesla&#8217;s moves, the decision to stop using the sensor runs counter to the industry standard. For now, the radar-less cars will only be sold in North America. Tesla didn&#8217;t state when or if it might remove the radar sensor in vehicles built for Chinese and European customers. Automakers typically use a combination of radar and cameras — and even lidar — to provide the sensing required to deliver advanced driver assistance system features like adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, as well as lane keeping and automatic lane changes.</p>
<p>Musk has touted the potential of its branded &#8220;Tesla Vision&#8221; system, which only uses cameras and so-called neural net processing to detect and understand what is happening in the environment surrounding the vehicle and then respond appropriately. Neural nets are a form of machine learning that work similarly to how humans learn. It is a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence algorithm that allows a computer to learn by using a series of connected networks to identify patterns in data. Many companies developing self-driving tech use deep neural networks to handle specific problems. But they wall off the deep nets and use rules-based algorithms to tie into the broader system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380796939151704071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company detailed the transition away from radar in an <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision">update on its website</a>, noting that the switch started this month. This camera-plus-machine learning (specifically neural net processing) approach has been dubbed Tesla Vision and will be used in its standard Autopilot advanced driver assistance system as well as in its $10,000 upgraded feature that has been branded Full Self-Driving or FSD. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving and require a human driver to remain engaged.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles that are delivered without radar will initially limit Autopilot, including the lane-keeping feature known as Autosteer. For a short period of time, Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph and a longer minimum following distance. The system&#8217;s emergency lane departure avoidance feature and smart summon, which allows the driver to summon its vehicle in a parking lot, may be disabled at delivery, Tesla said.</p>
<p>The company plans to restore these features through wireless software updates in the coming weeks. Tesla didn&#8217;t provide a specific timeline. All other available Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features will be active at delivery, depending on order configuration, the company said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new Model S and Model X vehicles as well as every model built for markets outside of North America, will continue to be equipped with radar and will have radar-supported Autopilot functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Model 3 and Model Y are our higher volume vehicles,&#8221; Tesla noted in its frequently asked questions section. &#8220;Transitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors released its Q1 earnings yesterday, and the electric vehicle manufacturer is facing a few challenges.</p>
<p>Expenses were higher than expected, it plans to slash production by about 50%, and the company reported zero revenue and a net loss of $125 million. Oh, it also needs more capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there’s more to the Lordstown mess than merely a single bad quarter,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;Lordstown’s earnings mess and the resulting dissonance with its own predictions are notable on their own, but they also point to what could be shifting sentiment regarding SPAC combinations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In light of the company&#8217;s lackluster earnings report (and a pending SEC investigation), Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">unpacks the company&#8217;s Q1</a>, &#8220;but don’t think that we’re only singling out one company; others fit the bill, and more will in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Join TechCrunch reporter Ron Miller and Patrik Liu Tran, co-founder and CEO of automated real-time data validation and quality monitoring platform Validio, on Thursday, May 27 at 9 a.m. PDT/noon EDT for a Clubhouse chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/">ensuring data quality in the era of Big Data</a>.</p>
<p>The world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, but modern data infrastructure still lacks solutions for monitoring data quality and data validation.</p>
<p>Among other topics, they&#8217;ll discuss the build versus buy debate, how to better understand data failures, and why traditional methods for identifying data failures are no longer operational.</p>

<h2>How Expensify shed Silicon Valley arrogance to realize its global ambitions</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2148705" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148705" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2148705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg" alt="The Expensify origin story" width="1024" height="686" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg 2463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=1536,1029 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=2048,1372 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Expensify-part1_v2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148705" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Nigel Sussman</p></div></p>
<p>Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.</p>
<p>The startup’s history is tied to places representative of San Francisco: The founding team worked out of Peet’s Coffee on Mission Street for a few months, then crashed at a penthouse lounge near the 4th and King Caltrain station, followed by a tiny office and then a slightly bigger one in the Flatiron building near Market Street.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, Expensify still has an office a few blocks away on Kearny Street, but it’s no longer a San Francisco company or even a Silicon Valley firm. The company is truly global with employees across the world — and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.</p>
<p>It makes sense that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">a company founded by internet pirates</a> would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?</p>
<p>As I described in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">Part 2 of this EC-1</a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. It’s also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. It’s also got annual fully paid month-long “workcations” for every employee, their partner and kids.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Jordan Crook interviewed Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world’s biggest hospitality startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it’s like driving a car. You can’t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen.</p>
<p>Now imagine you’re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.&#8221;</p>

<p>There’s latent demand for life insurance currently unaddressed by much of the financial services industry, and embedded finance can be the solution.</p>
<p>It’s imperative for companies to consider product lines and partnerships to expand markets, create new revenue streams and provide added value to their customers.</p>
<p>Connecting consumers with products they need through channels they already know and trust is both a massive revenue opportunity and a social good, providing financial resilience to families at a time when they need it most.</p>

<p>Zeta Global raised north of $600 million in private capital in the form of both equity financing and debt, making it a unicorn worth understanding.</p>
<p>The gist is that Zeta ingests and crunches lots of data, helping its users market to their customers on a targeted basis throughout their individual buying lifecycles. In simpler terms, Zeta helps companies pitch customers in varied manners depending on their own characteristics.</p>
<p>You can imagine that, as the digital economy has grown, the sort of work Zeta Global supports has only expanded. So, has Zeta itself grown quickly? And does it have an attractive business profile? We want to know.</p>

<p>In 2016, more than 20 years after Amazon’s founding and 10 years since Shopify launched, it would have been easy to assume e-commerce penetration (the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online) would be over 50%.</p>
<p>But what we found was shocking: The U.S. was only approximately 8% penetrated — only 8% for arguably the most advanced economy in the world!</p>
<p>Despite e-commerce growth skyrocketing over the past year, the reality is the U.S. has still only reached an e-commerce penetration rate of around 17%. During the last 18 months, we’ve closed the gap to South Korea and China’s e-commerce penetration of more than 25%, but there is still much progress to be made.</p>
<p>Here are five key predictions for what this road to further penetration will hold.</p>

<p>Every company wants to be innovative, but innovation comes with its share of difficulties. One key challenge for early-stage companies that are disrupting a particular space or creating a new category is figuring out how to sell a unique product to customers who have never bought such a solution.</p>
<p>This is especially the case when a solution doesn’t have many reference points and its significance may not be obvious.</p>
<p>Some buyers could use a walkthrough of the buying process. If you are building a singular product in a nascent market that necessitates forward-looking customers and want to drastically shorten sales cycles, create a buyer’s guide.</p>

<p>Pay attention to red flags when meeting with VCs: If they cancel late or leave you waiting, it’s a sign, just like being asked generic questions that demonstrate little or no understanding of the proposition. If they critique you or your business, that’s fine (obviously), but make sure you find out what’s behind their assertions to judge how well informed they are.</p>
<p>If you’re going to face these people each month and debate the direction of your business, the least you can expect is a robust argument outlining precisely why you may not have all the right answers.</p>
<p>If you fail to spot the warning signs, you’ll live to regret it. But do your due diligence and work constructively with them and, together, you might actually build a sustainable future.</p>

<p>This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>In this edition, we have a lot of items concerned with the interface between AI or robotics and the real world. Of course, most applications of this type of technology have real-world applications, but specifically, this research is about the inevitable difficulties that occur due to limitations on either side of the real-virtual divide.</p>

<p>Netflix has two CEOs: Co-founder Reed Hastings oversees the streaming side of the company, while Ted Sarandos guides Netflix’s content.</p>
<p>Warby Parker has co-CEOs as well — its co-founders went to college together. Other companies like the tech giant Oracle and luggage maker Away have shifted from having co-CEOs in recent years, sparking a wave of headlines suggesting that the model is broken.</p>
<p>While there isn’t a lot of research on companies with multiple CEOs, the data is more promising than the headlines would suggest. One study on public companies with co-CEOs revealed that the average tenure for co-CEOs, about 4.5 years, was comparable to solitary CEOs, “suggesting that this arrangement is more stable than previously believed.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s impossible to be in two places at once or clone yourself. With co-CEOs, you can effectively do just that.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For societies with long histories of protecting children with laws and regulations, isn’t it surprising that nothing is being done to similarly shield them from the various and proven dangers of social media? We need to institute the same kinds of age limits and protections for technology and web use as we’ve done for decades in almost every other sphere.</p>
<p>Think about it. We don’t let young people drive, drink, smoke, get married, join the Army, get a tattoo or vote until we feel they’re old enough to handle it.</p>
<p>But we put some of the most powerful technologies ever known to humankind in the hands of a 13-year-old, and then stand back in amazement when <a href="https://bit.ly/3teWOmL">online bullying</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/2OKteq9">body dysmorphia</a> issues go off the charts, when <a href="https://bit.ly/2PYU8Lw">self-harm</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3sdAdpf">suicide rates</a> explode, when <a href="https://bbc.in/2RvvNgO">rape culture</a> is inculcated within a generation of young children steeped in porn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For parents with teenage kids, there is a growing, horrifying realization that over the last 10 years, we’ve knowingly surrendered our offspring as guinea pigs to a grand scheme from tech companies focused on “maximizing engagement” for the sake of profit, with little or no regard to the consequences.</p>

			For societies with long histories of protecting children with laws and regulations, isn’t it surprising that nothing is being done to similarly shield them from the various and proven dangers of social media?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We parents were so in love with cool tech ourselves that we thought it hip and helpful and safe to get Johnny and Jane a phone, with a similar disregard for what damage this could do to their self-esteem and healthy development. The first little emoji text we got from them seemed cute. We didn’t realize it was going to turn into 100, then 500, then 1,000 — a day.</p>
<p>Forgive us, Lord, for we know not what we do.</p>
<p>Try putting <em>your </em>phone down. Go on, do it now. Count how long you can go before you can’t resist picking it up again. How long did you manage? Not long, right? You (like most of us) are a tech addict, and you’re an adult, with willpower and the ability to defer gratification that <em>your</em> upbringing drilled into you. Imagine what it’s like for a 16-year-old whose whole life has been a never-ending carousel of instant gratification.</p>
<p>And we’re surprised when our kids look washed out in the morning before school, after a night of Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and a whole bunch of apps your kids know about but you’ve never heard of. School that now involves even more time staring at a screen.</p>
<h2>A license to scroll</h2>
<p>Having an age limit — we suggest 18 for phones and social media — will begin the process of readjusting our relationship with technology toward our better angels. Just as we teach young people to drive a car with driving lessons, classwork, a highway code guide and a test, let’s teach them how to use social media in a way that won’t harm them. Let’s introduce a “social media user license” that requires passing a test and can be revoked if they don’t follow the rules of the “information superhighway.”</p>
<p>Some people think social media is now so pervasive that it’s impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. But we disagree. In fact, we feel that a fatalistic acceptance of what’s going on is morally unconscionable. Remember, all it takes for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing.</p>
<p>We’ve proved we can introduce rules and regulations to ensure the wise use of powerful technologies. We’ve done it before, with the aforementioned cars, with radiography and nuclear energy — in fact, with all dual-purpose technologies we’ve created. What’s different about social media? Indeed, in some countries, legislation is beginning to emerge. The U.K., as an example, recently introduced proposed laws that would fine, or even shut down, social media platforms that fail to protect children from harm online.</p>
<p>Some people think that even if we wanted to put age limits in place we couldn’t enforce them, logistically. Of course we could — with the biometric security systems now commonplace on our phones (fingerprint readers, facial recognition, etc.) and with the algorithms that routinely customize feeds for billions of active users per day, or with any variety of existing technical solutions. It is simply a question of having the will. Then the way will emerge.</p>
<h2>Keeping a good from becoming evil</h2>
<p>We don’t want to ban social media. When used responsibly, it’s a wonderful thing. Particularly now, during the pandemic, social media has been a lifeline against isolation and loneliness. Who can even imagine how much worse sheltering in place and quarantine would have been without technology that allowed us to connect with each other at the exact time we were forced apart? In just a matter of weeks, we simultaneously became more separated — physically — and connected — digitally — than ever before in history.</p>
<p>But social media has grown so vast and so powerful that we’re now past the point where we can continue to justify naïveté and youthful exuberance. It’s time to admit that the inventors, company leaders and consumers — yes, us, too — of these new technologies all know what we are doing. And worse, what we’re doing to our children’s minds.</p>
<p>The final objection to our argument is that, even if there were an age limit in place, kids would find a way around it. This is obviously true. Some kids would find a way to access the tech and apps they see adults using, just as some kids drink and smoke before they’re of the legal age. But if we believed that because some people break laws, there’s no point in having them, anarchy would await. Imperfect compliance with the law is no argument for its absence.</p>
<p>Young people are not mature enough to be exposed to the bottomless scroll of FOMO, YOLO, trolling, abuse, lunacy and unadulterated filth that is just another day on social media. There’s so much evidence of the harm that is being done to kids by it, if you care to look. San Diego State University professor of psychology Jean Twenge’s “<a href="https://amzn.to/2QjplsL">iGen</a>” has a lot of the details &#8212; if you dare to look.</p>
<p>It’s a parental instinct to protect your children, so let’s act now and set an age limit to spare them from social media’s dark side until they’re mature enough to make responsible choices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In all likelihood, you do not currently associate Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, essayist and cultural critic, with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneurs Brad Feld and Dave Jilk &#8212; whose friendship dates back to their college days at MIT &#8212; think that you should. Indeed, in the foreword of their new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Weekly-Nietzsche-Book-Disruptors-ebook/dp/B0932BPN7N/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Entrepreneur%E2%80%99s+Weekly+Nietzsche%3A+A+Book+for+Disruptor&amp;qid=1621968857&amp;sr=8-1">&#8220;The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Weekly Nietzsche: A Book for Disruptors,&#8221;</a> another renowned entrepreneur (and former philosophy student), Reid Hoffman, explains how Nietzsche has inspired him to think differently throughout his own career, noting that, like disruptive entrepreneurs, Nietzsche &#8220;wanted to destroy the old mindsets that locked people into the past&#8221; and that his &#8220;fierce allegiance to the new&#8221; is as relevant today as it was 150 years ago.</p>
<p>If setting aside precious time to study Nietzsche sounds daunting, don&#8217;t worry; Feld and Jilk clearly get it. Their new book aims to make his writings accessible by focusing on their modern-day applicability, arranging their new book into 52 individual chapters &#8212; one for each week of the year &#8212; that each begin with a Nietzsche quote, then quickly delve into an oral history from a founder that ties back to his words.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yesterday, we asked Feld, who has written books about venture capital and startup communities in the past, about his newest project. Our exchange has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the impetus for this new book? </strong></p>
<p>BF: This has been an on-again, off-again project with Dave, my first business partner, that began in 2013. We were spending the weekend in Keystone with our wives Amy and Maureen, which generally involved a lot of sitting around reading. Dave was reading &#8220;On Nietzsche&#8221; by Eric Steinhart. He read a quote to me and asked if I thought it sounded like an entrepreneur. Dave remembers me saying, “Hmmm, it sure does.” Then we both went back to our books.</p>
<p>As Dave went deeper into studying Nietzsche, we kept talking about Nietzsche quotes that prompted discussions around aspects of entrepreneurship. I had gone deep into Stoicism and was in love with what Ryan Holiday was doing with his writing. His book &#8220;The Obstacle is the Way&#8221; had a huge impact on me.</p>
<p>By 2016, we’d started working on the book. When Ryan came out with &#8220;The Daily Stoic,&#8221; I suggested to Dave that we write a book using this format. After a little more work, we changed the approach a little, focusing on 52 quotes instead of 365, making our interpretation a little longer and adding a narrative from an entrepreneur to many of the quotes.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is an incredibly important and deeply misunderstood philosopher. He’s the bridge between many things that came before him &#8212; beyond just philosophy &#8212; and many things that have come after him. Rather than state the answer, he provokes and encourages deep thought. In some ways, he’s the perfect philosophical mentor for an entrepreneur since you can apply his quotes in many different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Should this be placed in the business section or philosophy section of a bookstore?</strong></p>
<p>Well, according to Amazon, it’s already showing up in both! Dave and I wrote this to be an entrepreneurship book, as applied philosophy, but our fantasy is that philosophers who appreciate applications will like what we&#8217;ve done. We&#8217;re not experts on Nietzsche, nor do we pretend to be Nietzsche scholars. However, we have both read a lot of Nietzsche at this point, so we’ve been deliberate in the quotes we’ve chosen and how we interpret them.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs are often too busy to be introspective, as you acknowledge in the book. How do you persuade them to make the time? </strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is extremely challenging. It can be excruciatingly difficult. The highs are extraordinary. The lows are devastating. They come endlessly, with unexpected frequency.</p>
<p>If you don’t know your “why,” being an entrepreneur is much more difficult than it needs to be. And, no one can tell you your “why” — you have to discover it for yourself. As you grow, experience and age, your “why” will change. You have to build the muscle to continually figure out your “why,” and figure out how it relates to what you are doing.</p>
<p>If you can’t make the time for this, your journey as an entrepreneur will be much harder. When you face failure, it could be catastrophic or permanent rather than episodic. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, you won’t have the tools to figure out what to do to emerge stronger. While you may utter Nietzsche’s famous quote, “What does not kill me makes me stronger,&#8221; if you haven’t thought about it, you are echoing a cliché rather than incorporating an important concept into your way of being.</p>
<p>As for when [to find the time], we talk in the book about establishing cycles of “stepping back” from the business. We discuss the notion of a “metastrategy” — what is your strategy for periodically revising your strategy? We also observe that when things are going well you are likely to plateau, making that an important &#8212; though counterintuitive &#8212; time to think hard.</p>
<p><strong>There are great oral histories throughout this book. How did you choose the storytellers and were they interviewed or did you email them questions, then edit down their responses? </strong></p>
<p>We focused on experiences we were aware of and people we thought might have some connection to the quote. We used our primary network but didn&#8217;t try to be exhaustive. Some of the experiences we already knew about or had played a role in; others were new to us.</p>
<p>We emailed them the quote and a short guideline of what we were looking for. In most cases they wrote a nearly finished narrative; in a few cases, they gave us an outline and we filled it in, or we interviewed them and wrote the text ourselves. We wanted these narratives to feel like the entrepreneurs were talking to the reader in their own voices, and telling the stories that occurred to them, rather than making it an extension of the essay.</p>
<p>We especially love the [stories] where the narrative went in a different direction than our preceding essay, as it demonstrates the different ways Nietzsche can provoke thoughts from a simple quote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the company's putative performance not being very good thus far today, I can't really find much bad about the company's valuation and implied multiples.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The spinout of video platform Vimeo from IAC <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iac-completes-spin-off-of-vimeo-301298522.html">completed today</a>, with the smaller company now trading as an independent entity under the ticker symbol VMEO.</p>
<p>If you missed the news that the internet conglomerate was spinning out the video service, don&#8217;t feel bad; it slipped past many radars. But with the company now trading, with our <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1837686/000183768621000004/vmeo-20210331.htm">access to its historical results</a>, and with our minds still enthralled by YouTube&#8217;s recent financial performance for Alphabet, it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to digest the company&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s answer a few questions: How quickly is Vimeo growing, how profitable is its business, and what can its spinout tell us about the larger video market? Recall that Kaltura, another video-powering company, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/as-procore-looks-to-nearly-double-its-private-valuation-the-ipo-market-shows-signs-of-life/">put its IPO back into the pipeline</a> after a small delay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">during what felt like a snap-freeze of the public markets</a> toward the start of the second quarter.</p>
<p>So the Vimeo debut could impact a possible forthcoming unicorn IPO. With that in mind, let&#8217;s dig into the numbers.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Vimeo&#8217;s revenues expanded from $57 million to $89.4 million, a gain of around 57%. That&#8217;s a solid pace of expansion, but not a surprising one considering how much digital video the world consumed during the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that could have bolstered the company&#8217;s recent performance.</p>
<p>Over the same time frame, Vimeo&#8217;s gross profit grew from $38.6 million to $64.5 million, a gain of around 67%. As you can infer from faster-rising gross profit than revenue, Vimeo&#8217;s gross margins improved during Q1 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, from 68% to 72%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Turntable.fm&#8217;s founder Billy Chasen dusted off the old site and resurrected it for the pandemic age. I know I wasn’t the only one feeling a wistful pang of nostalgia for the service during the long, dull days of sheltering in place. And while March 2020 would have been the best time for a relaunch, March 2021 was pretty good, too.</p>
<p>Today Chasen <a href="https://blog.turntable.fm/im-super-excited-to-announce-that-turntable-has-raised-7-5-b3f676b90c0d">announced that the service</a> has received a nice little slice of VC backing to help the service (which has thus far been invite/password only) take the next step. Andreessen Horowitz led the $7.5 million round a decade after the site’s original launch. Funding had thus far been limited to fans through services like Patreon and Venmo. He notes that he will be turning off the service&#8217;s Patreon.</p>
<p>Chasen is staying mum as far as where the funding will go, stating, “And now with the new fundraising, we can continue to innovate and truly explore the cross section of social + music. I have a lot of ideas for the space and I’m excited to start building them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though, a blog post does note that the company is hiring engineers and designers. Understandable, though as someone <a href="https://turntable.fm/profile/604154afc2dbd9001be73f2d">who’s been enjoying the site</a> these last few months, I’m actually pretty surprised at how fresh the whole thing feels.</p>
<p>The team found a clever loophole around music rights in the form of YouTube videos, but perhaps a future version of the service will involve more direct music licensing or ties to popular apps like Spotify. A mobile app would be nice, if I&#8217;m just spitballing here.</p>
<p>Turntable.fm initially shut down back in 2013, stating at the time, “It was a tough decision to make because we love this community so much, but the cost of running a music service has been too expensive and we can’t outpace it with our efforts to monetize it and cut costs.&#8221; The service added that it was focusing on a live events platform instead.</p>
<p>Notably, Turntable.fm is not the only Turntable service looking to relaunch in 2021. There’s also Turntable.org (confusingly <a href="https://tt.fm/">located at TT.fm</a>), which is seeking fan funding, as well as looking toward a subscription fee. It announced that it had raised $500,000 in March and was aiming for an April launch for a mobile and desktop version. The site currently reads, “We’re building a new version just as much fun as the original.”</p>
<p>The two Turntables are not affiliated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s it like raising a round in 2021? How has it changed over the last few months, as some glimmer of normalcy seems, at least, within reach? What do early-stage founders (and investors!) need to know about the current state of the industry?</p>
<p>Few are in a better place to outline this than Avlok Kohli, the CEO of <a href="https://www.angellist.com">AngelList Venture</a> who will let you know at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=angelistventurepost">TC Early Stage on July 8-9</a>. With more than $2.2 billion in assets under management and over 5,000 startups funded on the platform, AngelList has data-driven insights that just about no one else could offer. Kohli joined AngelList Venture as CEO in mid-2019, giving him a remarkably unique view of the industry through a particularly wild time.</p>
<p>Kohli also knows what it&#8217;s like to be a founder, having been in that seat multiple times. In 2014 he founded Fastbite, a low-cost meal delivery service; in 2015, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/square-caviar-fastbite/">sold it to Square</a>. He dove back in with a daily house cleaning service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/15/fairy-housecleaning/">called Fairy</a> in 2017, and sold it to Postmates at the beginning of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re super excited to announce that Avlok Kohli will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=angelistventurepost">TC Early Stage on July 8-9</a> to get us all up to speed on the state of play in early-stage investing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Washington, DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a new antitrust suit against Amazon Tuesday, accusing the company of stifling competition by exerting control over third-party sellers.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in DC Superior Court, alleges that Amazon fixed prices on its massive online retail platform by blocking third-party sellers from selling their products for less elsewhere. Racine argues that this kind of arrangement means that sellers roll Amazon&#8217;s hefty fees into their prices, creating an &#8220;artificially high&#8221; price floor across the online retail market.</p>
<p>That practice may run afoul of the District of Columbia’s Antitrust Act. The AG&#8217;s office argues that the practice allows Amazon to exert monopoly power in online retail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Amazon has used its dominant position in the online retail market to win at all costs. It maximizes its profits at the expense of third-party sellers and consumers, while harming competition, stifling innovation, and illegally tilting the playing field in its favor,&#8221; Racine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We filed this antitrust lawsuit to put an end to Amazon’s illegal control of prices across the online retail market. We need a fair online marketplace that expands options available to District residents and promotes competition, innovation, and choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DC AG lawsuit is the latest state-level effort to take tech&#8217;s most powerful companies down a notch. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Google</a> are both facing multi-state lawsuits for alleged anticompetitive behavior, even as federal lawmakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">creep toward major antitrust reform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a> exists with one primary goal in mind: to give people a place to buy and sell collectibles (like Pokémon cards, sports cards, pins, etc.) in a safe, authenticated way.</p>
<p>The company started out with intentions of being a GOAT/StockX-style resale marketplace, where the products up for sale lived on neat little pages with row after row of static images. As they started experimenting with other formats, they found one that really seemed to catch on: livestream sales. Think QVC or the Home Shopping Network&#8230; but instead of hosts in huge studios selling jewelry and patio furniture, it&#8217;s users with smartphones selling Charizard cards and Yoda figurines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088789" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088789" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="637" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg 1449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whatnot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">wrote about Whatnot last year</a>. In the short time since, the company has raised three increasingly large rounds: $4 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/whatnot-raises-4m-as-it-gets-into-livestreamed-auctions-and-pokemon-cards/">in December</a>, $20 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">in March</a> and, as of this morning, another $50 million.</p>
<p>While Whatnot still offers the more standard product pages to give sellers a 24/7 presence on the site, the livestreaming side of things has become the primary driver — by far. Co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me that livestreaming is currently &#8220;95% of the focus&#8221;; it&#8217;s where most of their sales are happening, and what users seem to care most about.</p>
<p>Another thing users seem to care about? Sports cards. Whatnot opened up the site to sports card sellers in January, and it almost immediately took over as the site&#8217;s best-selling category. The one category now accounts for &#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; in sales each month, the company says.</p>

<p>The Whatnot team itself is growing quickly as well. When I first spoke to them, it was just a handful of employees; by January of this year, they were up to 10. Today it&#8217;s 45 full-timers. By the end of the year, says Grant, they expect to be nearing 100.</p>
<p>While anyone can sell on Whatnot&#8217;s marketplace, only users that have been vetted/invited can sell via livestream. This helps to keep fraud low; sellers know that if they try to sneak in fake cards or rip anyone off, their access to livestreaming — and thus their audience — could vanish.</p>
<p>The company tells me that this Series B round was led by Anu Hariharan of Y Combinator Continuity fund, and backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Animal Capital and a number of angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salesforce dominates the world of CRM today, but while it&#8217;s a popular and well-used tool for organizing contacts and information, it doesn&#8217;t have all the answers when it comes to helping salespeople and marketers sell better, especially when meetings are not in person. Today, one of the startups that has emerged to help fill the gap is announcing a round of growth funding on the back of a huge year for its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qualified.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualified</a> &#8212; which builds better interactions for B2B sales and marketing teams that already use Salesforce by tapping into extra data sources to develop a better profile of those visiting your website, in aid of improving and personalizing the outreach (hence the name: you&#8217;re building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;qualified&#8221; leads</a>) &#8212; has picked up $51 million in funding. The startup will be using the Series B to continue building out its business with more functionality in the platform, and hiring across the board to expand business development and more.</p>
<p>Led by Salesforce Ventures, the funding round also included Norwest Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures, both previous backers, among others. As with so many rounds at the moment &#8212; the venture world is flush with funding at the moment &#8212; this one is coming less than a year after Qualified&#8217;s last raise. It closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/qualified-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12 million Series A</a> in August of last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TTTyJaeJXR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/qualified-series-a/">Qualified raises $12M to make websites smarter about sales and marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Qualified raises $12M to make websites smarter about sales and marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/qualified-series-a/embed/#?secret=TTTyJaeJXR" data-secret="TTTyJaeJXR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Qualified was co-founded by two Salesforce veterans &#8212; ex-Salesforce CMO Kraig Swensrud and ex-SVP of Salesforce.com Sean Whiteley &#8212; serial entrepreneurs who you could say have long been hammering away at the challenges of building digital tools for sales and marketing people to do their jobs better online. The pair have founded and sold two other startups filling holes to that end: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/12/getfeedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetFeedback</a>, acquired by <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/newsroom/surveymonkey-to-acquire-getfeedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/21/salesforce-dives-deep-into-google-adwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kieden, acquired by Salesforce</a>.</p>
<p>The gap that they&#8217;re aiming to fill with this latest venture is the fact that when sales and marketing teams want to connect with prospects directly through, say, a phone call, they might have all of that contact&#8217;s information at their disposal. But if those teams want to make a more engaged contact when someone is visiting their site &#8212; a sign that a person is actually interested and thinking already about engaging with a company &#8212; usually the sales and marketing teams are in the dark about who those visitors are.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded Qualified on the premise that a website should be more than a marketing brochure, but not just a sales site,&#8221; Swensrud, who is the CEO, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Qualified has built a tool that essentially takes several signals from Salesforce as well as other places to build up some information about the site visitor. It then uses it to give the sales and marketing teams more of a steer so that when they reach out via a screen chat to say &#8220;how can I help?&#8221; they actually have more information and can target their questions in a better way. A sales or marketing rep might know which pages a person is also visiting, and can then use the conversation that starts with an online chat to progress to a voice or video call, or a meeting.</p>
<p>If a person is already in your Salesforce Rolodex, you get more information; but even without that there is some detail provided to be slightly less impersonal. (Example: When I logged into Qualified to look around the site, a chat popped up with a person greeting me &#8220;across the pond&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m in London.)</p>
<p>Qualified also integrates with a number of other tools that are used to help source data and build its customer profiles, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Slack, Microsoft Teams, 6sense, Demandbase, Marketo, HubSpot, Oracle Eloqua, Clearbit, ZoomInfo and Outreach.</span></p>
<p>Additional data is part and parcel of the kinds of information that sales and marketing people always need when reaching out to prospective customers, whether it&#8217;s via a &#8220;virtual&#8221; digital channel or in person. However, in the last year &#8212; where in-person meetings, team meetings and working side-by-side with those who can give advice have all disappeared &#8212; having extra tools like these arguably have proven indispensable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sales reps would heavily rely on their ‘road warrior’ image,&#8221; Swensrud said. &#8220;But all that stuff is gone, so as a result every seller is sitting at an office, at home, expecting digital interactions to happen that never existed before.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it seems some believe that even outside of COVID-19 enforcing a different way of doing things, the trend for &#8220;virtual selling&#8221;, as it&#8217;s often called, is here to stay: Gartner forecasts that by 2025, some 80% of B2B sales interactions will take place in digital channels. (So long to the expense account lunch, I guess.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of the events of 2020, plus those bigger trends, that Qualified has seen revenues in the last year grow some 800% and its net customer revenue retention rate hover at 175%, with funding rounds come in relatively close succession in the wake of that.</p>
<p>There is something interesting to Qualified that reminds me a bit of more targeted ad retargeting, as it were, and in that, you can imagine a lot of other opportunities for how Qualified might expand in scenarios where it would be more useful to know why someone is visiting your site, without outright asking them and bothering them with the question. That could include customer service, or even a version that might sell better to consumers coming to, say, a clothes site after reading something about orange being the new black.</p>

<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s focused on the B2B opportunity.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools on the market that are competing with Salesforce as the go-to platform for people to organise and run CRM operations, but Swensrud is bullish for now on the idea of building specifically for the Salesforce ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our product is being driven by and runs on Salesforce,&#8221; he noted, pointing out that it&#8217;s through Salesforce that you&#8217;re able to go from chatting to a phone call by routing the information to the data you have on file there. &#8220;Our roots go very deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding round today is a sign that Salesforce is also happy with that close arrangement, which gives it a customization that its competitors lack.</p>
<p>“Qualified represents an entirely new way for B2B companies to engage buyers,” said Bill Patterson, EVP of CRM Applications at Salesforce, in a statement. “When marketing and inbound sales teams use this solution with Sales Cloud&#8230; they see a notable impact on pipeline. We are thrilled about our growing partnership with Qualified and their success within the Salesforce ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ontvpass.com/">Struum</a>, the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/former-disney-and-discovery-execs-to-launch-struum-a-classpass-for-streaming-services/">streaming service from former Disney and Discovery execs</a>, is today officially launching to the public. Unlike traditional on-demand streamers, such as Netflix, the Struum model is more akin to a &#8220;ClassPass for streaming,&#8221; as its plan is to aggregate content from smaller video services then provide access under its own subscription.</p>
<p>Today, the streaming landscape is dominated by larger subscription services, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, HBO Max, Disney+ and YouTube, which together have a 75% share of the market, according to Nielsen. But Struum believes there&#8217;s a potential for another service powered by the long tail of the more than 250 niche and specialty streamers.</p>
<p>Many of these smaller services offer their own subscriptions, but will never achieve Netflix-size scale because of their more limited catalog and scope. Struum offers them an alternative path to revenue. Each month, Struum customers will pay a $4.99 subscription fee to access the Struum app where they&#8217;re then provided with 100 &#8220;credits&#8221; they can use to sample and consume content &#8212; just as ClassPass did with gym classes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former Disney and Discovery execs to launch Struum, a &#8216;ClassPass for streaming services&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/former-disney-and-discovery-execs-to-launch-struum-a-classpass-for-streaming-services/embed/#?secret=oYCvQQqOYs" data-secret="oYCvQQqOYs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over time, if the customer continues to use their subscription to routinely access content from one service, they can then opt to become a subscriber to that service from within the Struum app. This part of the business isn&#8217;t all that different from Amazon Prime Video Channels or others like it. But the difference is that Struum&#8217;s sampling model is what helped the customer discover the niche streamer in the first place.</p>
<p>Struum, meanwhile, generates its own revenue from customers&#8217; subscriptions, which it shares with its content partners. It won&#8217;t say what sort of cut it takes, however.</p>

<p>At launch, there are more than 25 partners available through the Struum app, including Tastemade, Tribeca, Cheddar News, Kocowa, Dekkoo, Magellan TV, History Hit, Gusto, Young Hollywood, Indieflix, Filmbox, Echoboom Sports, Social Club TV, Cinedigm, Magnolia Pictures, Little Dot Studios, Group 9, Stingray and SPI/Filmhub.</p>
<p>Later this summer, the lineup will grow to more than 50 partners, with additions that include BBC SELECT, REVOLT, France Channels, InsightTV, Docubay, FuelTV, The Great Courses Signature Collection, Shout Factory TV, OUTtv, SVTV, CGOOD TV and Alchimie.</p>
<p>In total, Struum&#8217;s partners will provide customers with access to tens of thousands of movies and TV shows across a range of categories and genres, like classic films, indies, foreign content, cult hits, lifestyle programming, reality, true crime and more.</p>

<p>Struum&#8217;s app guides users to their interests through a simple interface where it curates content into editorial groupings organized much like the rows of recommendations you&#8217;d find in Netflix. This includes the company&#8217;s own picks (&#8220;Struum Selects&#8221;), as well as groupings by genre &#8212; like Comedy, Action Thrillers, LGBTQ + Documentaries, Class Movies, Incredible Science and others. You also can browse by type from categories across the top, to filter by only Movies, TV shows or Shorts.</p>

<p>At launch, Struum&#8217;s service is available on iOS and web, and supports AirPlay and Chromecast. This summer, it will expand to more platforms, including Android, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and Roku.</p>

<p>The idea for the company comes from founders Lauren DeVillier, the former head of Product for Discovery Ventures; Eugene Liew, the former vice president of Product and Technology at Disney+; Paul Pastor, the former executive vice president of Strategy, Revenue and Operations at Discovery Networks; and Thomas Wadsworth, the former lead of Advanced Product Development for Walt Disney Imagineering.</p>
<p>The team came together in 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out across the U.S., which drove increased demand for streaming content. And though that demand may be here to stay, it remains to be seen whether Struum&#8217;s ClassPass-like model makes the best sense for streaming&#8217;s long tail.</p>
<p>Despite its unique streaming business model, the service will effectively compete with AVOD (ad-supported video on demand) players in terms of aggregating both older and niche content. AVOD services &#8212; like Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, IMDb TV and others &#8212; also help users who can&#8217;t find anything they want to watch on their preferred paid subscription apps. And they often aid consumers who are in search of a particular movie or show but don&#8217;t want to pay for a rental. Struum believes by aggregating content it can encourage these users to pay for yet another subscription.</p>

<p>In other words, Struum will have to convince users to change their existing TV habits in order to find success, and that&#8217;s a risky bet.</p>
<p>But Struum believes the fragmentation of the streaming market may actually work in its favor. As consumers get fed up with so many different services and content that jumps around as rights owners forge new licensing agreements, Struum could step in as someone&#8217;s fourth subscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view ourselves as the ultimate complementary service and a perfect fit for TV and film lovers who are increasingly frustrated by the costs, complexity and effort required to discover and watch what they want,&#8221; noted Struum CEO Lauren DeViller.</p>
<p>Struum is backed by a multimillion-dollar investment from former Disney CEO Michael Eisner through his firm, Tornante Company. Other investors include Firstlight Media, whose technology powers the video service, and Gaingels, which focuses on backing LGBTQ+ founders and allies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the major issues facing companies these days isn&#8217;t finding relevant data so much as moving it to where it&#8217;s needed. Enter <a href="https://airbyte.io/">Airbyte</a>, an early-stage startup that is building an open-source data integration platform to help solve that problem. Today the company announced a $26 million Series A, just a couple of months after announcing its $5.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Benchmark led the investment with help from 8VC, Accel, SV Angel, Y Combinator and multiple tech industry luminaries. The company has raised more than $31 million, all of it coming this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is an open-source data integration platform to bring data wherever it is, whether it&#8217;s a database, a file or an API into the destination of your choice, whether it is a data warehouse or a data lake,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told TechCrunch. This involves building connectors to various data types. The company is providing the open-source platform and an SDK to build connectors, and inviting the community to add their own connectors, while building some too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things are moving quickly for the startup. In addition to the funding, it released its Connected Development Kit or CDK earlier this month. &#8220;It&#8217;s a local framework that enables you to build a custom connector within two hours instead of two or three days,&#8221; company co-founder John Lafleur explained. To this point, the community has contributed approximately 20% of the platform&#8217;s 70 connectors, but the two founders expect that percentage to increase as the CDK has time to spread in the community.</p>

<p>Airbyte was founded just last year and the company plans to spend this year trying to expand the rapidly growing community, which is up to 1,200 members and 500 active users to this point. The long-term plan is to build a hosted version, which they will charge for, while continuing to work on the open-source project.</p>
<p>Chetan Puttagunta, general partner at Benchmark, who is leading today&#8217;s investment, says that Benchmark has a long history of investing in open-source startups, including being an early investor in Red Hat, as well as Elastic, MongoDB, Acquia and many others.</p>
<p>He says that his firm approached Airbyte after seeing a lot of developer activity in the community in a short time. &#8220;We reached out to them just based on our involvement in the developer community. We started seeing Airbyte spike everywhere, and it started to become very quickly the de facto standard for how folks wanted to integrate data. And that was a remarkable achievement for a company that has been around for just several months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rapid growth has led to the number of employees doubling to 14 in a short time. When it comes to diversity and inclusion, the founders have actually <a href="https://handbook.airbyte.io/">written a company handbook</a> that includes a detailed section with definitions and goals <a href="https://handbook.airbyte.io/company/diversity-inclusion-and-belonging">around diversity and inclusion</a>, not something you often see from an early-stage company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try to constantly improve on diversity inclusion and belonging, which is a continuous [thing]. [We] never would think it was done, We always have room to improve,&#8221; Tricot said.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s history is tied to places representative of San Francisco: The founding team worked out of Peet&#8217;s Coffee on Mission Street for a few months, then crashed at a penthouse lounge near the 4th and King Caltrain station, followed by a tiny office and then a slightly bigger one in the Flatiron building near Market Street.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, Expensify still has an office a few blocks away on Kearny Street, but it&#8217;s no longer a San Francisco company or even a Silicon Valley firm. The company is truly global with employees across the world — and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things got so much better when we stopped viewing ourselves as a Silicon Valley company. We basically said, no, we&#8217;re just a global company,&#8221; CEO David Barrett told TechCrunch. That globalism led to it opening a major office in — of all places —a small town in rural Michigan. That Ironwood expansion would eventually lead to a cultural makeover that would see the company broadly abandon its focus on the Bay Area, expanding from a headquarters in Portland to offices around the globe.</p>
<p>It makes sense that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">a company founded by internet pirates</a> would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?</p>
<p>As I described in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">Part 2 of this EC-1</a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. It&#8217;s also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. It&#8217;s also got annual fully paid month-long &#8220;workcations&#8221; for every employee, their partner and kids.</p>
<p>Yet the real story is how a company can become untethered from its original geography, willing to adapt to new places and new cultures, and ultimately, give up the past while building the future.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world's biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we transition from the pandemic to whatever comes next, Airbnb is evolving. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">announced a major redesign of its website</a> and introduced a bevy of features focused on both hosts and guests today. All told, the release includes more than 100 new features or upgrades, with the goal of increasing and diversifying the supply side of the business to not only fuel overall growth but also meet the changing demands of guests.</p>
<p>The changes come in response to the way travel has evolved during the pandemic; Airbnb as a company has changed, too.</p>
<p>TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel, how his company worked to support a changing market and what it was like leading the world&#8217;s biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about today&#8217;s update, you can check out our article on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>New search flexibility around dates, destinations and matching criteria.</li>
<li>Easier onboarding and efficiency for hosts.</li>
<li>Increased and enhanced customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a very high level, the first change is designed to help drive demand, the second to boost supply and the third to keep both sides of the marketplace healthy.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s interview with Chesky follows. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: A lot of the announcement today comes from the fact that we&#8217;ve been through more than a year of a pandemic and travel has evolved, and you are responding to that. As a CEO, you&#8217;ve been through so many big moments, from the IPO to the early launch days to a long regulatory journey. Where does leading a company during a pandemic fit into the CEO journey for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Chesky:</strong> Yeah, Jordan, I would probably say that I never thought we would do anything as crazy as starting Airbnb. I kind of assumed, until last year, that that would probably be the craziest story I&#8217;ll ever have. Little did I know that a travel company in a pandemic might even be crazier than starting a company based on strangers living together. I kind of feel like I&#8217;m now 39 going on 49. It was definitely the craziest year ever.</p>
<p>Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it&#8217;s like driving a car. You can&#8217;t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen. Now imagine you&#8217;re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today announced PyTorch Enterprise, a new Azure service that provides developers with additional support when using PyTorch on Azure. It&#8217;s basically Microsoft&#8217;s commercial support offering for PyTorch.</p>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is a Python-centric open-source machine learning framework with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing. It was originally developed by Facebook and is, at least to some degree, comparable to Google&#8217;s popular TensorFlow framework.</p>
<p>Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for communications, described the new PyTorch Enterprise service as providing developers with &#8220;a more reliable production experience for organizations using PyTorch in their data sciences work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With PyTorch Enterprise, members of Microsoft&#8217;s Premier and Unified support program will get benefits like prioritized requests, hands-on support and solutions for hotfixes, bugs and security patches, Shaw explained. Every year, Microsoft will also select one PyTorch version for long-term support.</p>
<p>Azure already made it <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/pytorch/">relatively easy to use PyTorch</a>, and Microsoft has long invested in the library by, for example, taking over the development of PyTorch for Windows <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/microsoft-becomes-maintainer-of-the-windows-version-of-pytorch/">last year</a>. As Microsoft noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the latest release of PyTorch will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning and the company promises to feed back to the public PyTorch distribution the PyTorch code it gets from developers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCFgTT5AZS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand/">5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand/embed/#?secret=TCFgTT5AZS" data-secret="TCFgTT5AZS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enterprise support will be available for PyTorch version 1.8.1 and up on Windows 10 and a number of popular Linux distributions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new enterprise-level offering by Microsoft closes an important gap. PyTorch gives our researchers unprecedented flexibility in designing their models and running their experiments,&#8221; said Jeremy Jancsary, senior principal research scientist at Nuance. &#8220;Serving these models in production, however, can be a challenge. The direct involvement of Microsoft lets us deploy new versions of PyTorch to Azure with confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new offering, Microsoft is taking a page out of the open-source monetization playbook for startups by offering additional services on top of an open-source project. Since PyTorch wasn&#8217;t developed by a startup, only to have a major cloud provider then offer its own commercial version on top of the open-source code, this feels like a rather uncontroversial move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unlike in other years, this year&#8217;s Microsoft Build developer conference is not packed with huge surprises &#8212; but there&#8217;s one announcement that will surely make developers&#8217; ears perk up: The company is now using OpenAI&#8217;s massive GPT-3 natural language model in its no-code/low-code Power Apps service to translate spoken text into code in its recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/">Power Fx language</a>.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get carried away. You&#8217;re not going to develop the next TikTok while only using natural language. Instead, what Microsoft is doing here is taking some of the low-code aspects of a tool like Power Apps and using AI to essentially turn those into no-code experiences, too. For now, the focus here is on Power Apps formulas, which despite the low-code nature of the service, is something you&#8217;ll have to write sooner or later if you want to build an app of any sophistication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using an advanced AI model like this can help our low-code tools become even more widely available to an even bigger audience by truly becoming what we call no code,&#8221; said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s low-code application platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In practice, this looks like the citizen programmer writing &#8220;find products where the name starts with &#8216;kids&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; and Power Apps then rendering that as <em>&#8220;Filter(‘BC Orders’ Left(‘Product Name’,4)=&#8221;Kids&#8221;)&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/">an investor in OpenAI</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise the company chose its model to power this experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156679" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156679" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156679" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156679" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while this makes programming easier, Microsoft itself stresses that users still have to understand the logic of the application they are building. &#8220;The features don’t replace the need for a person to understand the code they are implementing but are designed to assist people who are learning the Power Fx programming language and help them choose the right formulas to get the result they need. That can dramatically expand access to more advanced app building and more rapidly train people to use low code tools,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>To some degree, this isn&#8217;t all that different from using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-intro">natural language query functions</a> that are now available in tools like <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/introducing-natural-language-queries-in-ideas/ba-p/1594687">Excel</a>, PowerBI or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/analyzing-text-in-a-google-sheet-using-cloud-natural-language-api-and-apps-script">Google Sheets</a>. These, too, translate natural language into a formula, after all. GPT-3 is probably a bit more sophisticated than this and capable of understanding more complex queries, but translating natural language into formulas isn&#8217;t all that new.</p>
<p>The long-term promise here, though, is for tools like this to become smarter over time and be able to handle more complicated programming tasks. But that&#8217;s a big step up from what is essentially a translation problem, though. More complex queries require more of an understanding of a program as a whole. A formula, for the most part, is a pretty self-contained statement but a similar model that could generate &#8220;real&#8221; code would have to contend with a lot more context.</p>
<p>These new features will go live in public preview in English to users in North America by the end of June.</p>
