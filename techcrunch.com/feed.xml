										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth marketing is often misconceived as a set of tactics when it&#8217;s much more: It is a process that startups need to put in place in their early days that will scale as their customer base and internal teams grow.</p>
<p>This is where British growth agency <a href="https://ascendant.uk/">Ascendant</a> shines, Robyn Weatherley, head of marketing at <a href="https://www.thirdfort.com/">Thirdfort</a>, let us know via our growth marketing survey. Ascendant&#8217;s consultants haven&#8217;t just helped the British legal tech startup execute growth tactics, she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/growth-roundup-investing-in-community-targeting-developers-new-marketer-recs/">wrote</a>: &#8220;They’ve helped us set up the framework to keep executing on those whether we are five, 50 or 500 people.&#8221; (If you too have growth marketers to recommend, please<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"> fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come from a growth marketing background, you don&#8217;t know how to even frame the problem, let alone fix it. This is why so much startup marketing is tactical rather than strategic.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We followed up on this recommendation by interviewing Ascendant co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fergus1/">Gus Ferguson</a> and partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssabc/">Alyssa Crankshaw</a> for our ongoing series of growth marketer profiles. If you are in the U.K., you might know them from the <a href="https://techlondon.io/">TechLondon</a> Slack community, or bumped into them pre-COVID at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Online-Marketing-London/">OMN London events</a>, the digital marketing meetups they co-organize. In the interview below, they share how they work with early-stage companies, including tactical planning and building out tools for marketers to use without taking up internal engineering resources.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us about your background and how you came to work with startups?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>I&#8217;ve been a digital marketer for the last 15 or 16 years, and in 2009, I started one of the first content marketing agencies in the U.K. We did a lot of work with big travel brands, but the problem was that in big corporates, teams are in silos, so they weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of being at the forefront of marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>I was based in East London and I started working with a couple of startups. It&#8217;s also around that time that I partnered up with Alyssa. But we were looking at startups being hampered by traditional marketing &#8212; because traditional marketers were bringing big corporate problems to startups, when their key strength is their nimbleness and their agility and their ability to adapt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when we started developing processes for basically building businesses from scratch &#8212; when you don&#8217;t have any historical data to base your marketing strategies on. We were saying to them: Don&#8217;t ask us for a 12-month plan, because it&#8217;s a waste of time. But because there was that mindset at the time, that&#8217;s just what people expected. So we were going in and saying: You need a broad three-month plan, maximum; then a one-month plan in detail, and ideally a two-week sprint.</p>
<p><b>What kind of clients does Ascendant work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Thanks to the growth framework that we&#8217;ve built up over time, we can pretty much work with any new business where there&#8217;s no existing process for marketing. We work with fintech, healthcare and legal companies, e-commerce brands, and both B2C and B2B. So startups, but also startup-type businesses. For instance, we worked with corporate ventures like Canon and VCs like Forward Partners, which was really interesting learning, because we were working with earlier-stage businesses than we would normally.</p>
<p>One million in funding is our sweet spot for startups. The reason for that is that it costs money to bring experienced growth experts into business, and up to that point, I believe it is important for founders to understand growth themselves. Being able to understand how to do it at that early stage will create such a valuable foundation of audience centricity for that business moving forward. A lot of what we do is bringing audience centricity into product-focused businesses &#8212; and generally encouraging founders to think about why their audience should care that they&#8217;ve got a solution to their problem.</p>
<p><b>Right, &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; is a mistake that founders make all the time! Could you give more details on how you help them?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Generally we&#8217;ll look at whatever they have as a foundation, and at similar businesses, and we&#8217;ll create an initial growth model. We&#8217;ll start putting hypotheses in place as to which channels are going to be the most effective at hitting their short-term objectives if they have them ready. But often, part of the process is also defining which metrics matter for that business, and working out how to measure them.</p>
<p>We always start working with founders and sales, and generally before or with one first marketing hire in place. Part of our work is to come up with projected results based on their funnel, but very often, with product-centric businesses, it will be that funnel that&#8217;s missing. So we bring in a bit of funnel thinking to those businesses and get that in place.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p>And then there&#8217;s all sorts of what we call framework building that needs to be in place before you can start doing more traditional campaign-based marketing. So we&#8217;ll start looking at the specific frameworks around data, and how to form an objective truth for that business, with a shared understanding of the key metrics. When nobody knows what the fundamental data framework of that business looks like, for instance, because of team turnover or silos, we&#8217;ll tighten that up and make sure that everything is functioning together so that things like marketing automation are possible.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s perhaps a bit surprising about siloed teams at an early stage; how big are the startups you work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>We start when they are small, but we keep our clients for a long time. So, for example, we worked with <a href="https://www.elder.org/">Elder,</a> which is a health tech startup. When we started off with them, there were 12 people, and when we finished with them, there were hundreds of people. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/soldo/">Soldo</a> is another example: When we started the marketing team was one person, and by the time we left, they were spanning three floors at WeWork.</p>
<p>Our lifecycle ends at Series B, because at that point, all the frameworks will be in place and they&#8217;ll be bringing everything in-house. So that&#8217;s our happy ending when the clients get to huge Series B raises. And then we move on to the next one that needs our help to get there.</p>
<p>But to go back to your question, slips happen because these are very venture-backed companies with very high growth not just in customers but also in their internal teams. Everybody is doing everything, everybody is new at their jobs, and there aren&#8217;t very many internal processes, so there&#8217;s an element of chaos. That&#8217;s where the need for cross-functional teams grew from &#8212; to step out of everybody&#8217;s individual chaotic worlds and create an island of shared objectives and order.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189509" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189509" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2189509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?w=270" alt="Alyssa Crankshaw - Ascendant" width="270" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189509" class="wp-caption-text">Alyssa Crankshaw. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ascendant</p></div></p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw: </b>It&#8217;s just important for us to make people communicate. We often end up actually becoming a reason for the whole team to talk to each other &#8212; because we are external, they see more value in these tasks that they wouldn&#8217;t do otherwise.</p>
<p><b>How does that work in practice?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>An example of that is the CMS system we are putting in place for one client that we&#8217;re working with at the moment, where salespeople use it, marketing people use it, customer services people use it &#8212; and those teams were fairly siloed beforehand.</p>
<p>We also know that probably one of the biggest barriers to growth is marketers being dependent on developers, which are such a rare resource. We address that by implementing marketing frameworks at a basic level of the business whereby marketers are able to at least control basic marketing operations directly.</p>
<p>But one of the most important processes that we bring in is the cross-functional team, with one stakeholder from each department. It means that there&#8217;s at least one person on each team who understands what the objectives are, and then people start problem-solving together.</p>
<p><b>Didn&#8217;t that become more difficult with COVID-19?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Potentially it got easier with remote. Usually, we find one person on each team — generally the team&#8217;s leader — and we bring them as spokespersons into the cross-functional team. In a remote world, it&#8217;s actually easier because you can just all jump on Zoom calls.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: Even before COVID, we weren&#8217;t the type of consultants who sit several days a week in their client&#8217;s office. We are problem-solvers across the company, and we&#8217;ve always done that, whether it was from our old office or remotely now.</p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Our own model also proved exceptionally flexible when we needed it to be during the pandemic. We are a core team of three people, and we are working with a network of specialized freelancers &#8212; so instead of worrying about fixed overheads, we can have agreements with trusted partners and morph into whatever our clients need at that time. Because of the nature of startups, as I said earlier, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to have long-term plans for businesses where there&#8217;s such a high rate of change. And from an agency perspective, it means that what we&#8217;re doing one month is always very different from what we&#8217;re doing the next month.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: It&#8217;s a conscious decision not to follow a traditional agency model, because it helps us be flexible and bring in the specialists when we need them, rather than just having to use that person that sits on your payroll just because you have them. It&#8217;s much more effective for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a thing that people might not know about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Growth marketing is a process; it&#8217;s really how I differentiate it from traditional marketing. A lot of people will say that growth marketing is the AARRR funnel, but is that really any different from traditional marketing? Not really. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a broader set of channels than a traditional marketer would focus on. But what&#8217;s really different is the process that gives our clients confidence that they&#8217;re doing the right thing, even if they&#8217;ve never done it before. Because that&#8217;s how you learn.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with doing something new for the first time, in a team of people who are also doing a new thing for the first time with no historical data, is that you quite often don&#8217;t even know how to frame that. If you don&#8217;t come from a growth marketing background, you don&#8217;t know how to even frame the problem, let alone fix it. This is why so much startup marketing is tactical rather than strategic, or even worse, tool-led. People think: &#8220;Oh, if I was using this tool, then all my problems would be solved,&#8221;  when, actually, you need to be able to create the hypotheses and understand the objectives that the hypotheses are answering.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: We give our clients the roadmap, the foundation and the operational structure in which to run campaigns, retention, acquisition or whatever the target may be, which is huge for them. Because when creating everything from scratch, that&#8217;s where we often see a lot of overtesting. We love a good test &#8212; we&#8217;re both marketers &#8212; but we only like to test the big things. And sometimes when working with inexperienced people, we see a lot of new tests about the smallest things, which is a waste of time and resources. And there are some other things that are foundational, and you just know which they are if you are an experienced marketer and you have done this so many times in your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among Apple&#8217;s more recent social good initiatives is the Impact Accelerator, an effort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/apple-says-its-supply-chains-and-products-will-be-carbon-neutral-by-2030/">launched about a year ago</a> intended to find and elevate minority-owned small businesses taking on sustainability and climate change. The program now has its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-selects-15-black-and-brown-owned-businesses-for-impact-accelerator/">first 15 participants</a>, gathered from all over the country for a three-month program and a shot at an Apple contract.</p>
<p>The Impact Accelerator is part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/">$100M Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>, which is being divided between a number of efforts, some directly funding existing programs, some going to venture firms owned by people of color, and generally whatever the Initiative&#8217;s team thinks is a good investment.</p>
<p>These companies will take part in a three-month-long virtual program (the details are not discussed in Apple&#8217;s announcement post) and then will have the opportunity to become suppliers for Apple&#8217;s carbon neutral supply chain goals.</p>

<p>Apple profiles all 15 companies in this list, but here are five that caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volt Energy Utility</strong> (Co-Founder: Gilbert Campbell III) &#8211; Developer of utility-scale solar projects with a focus on underserved communities.</li>
<li><strong>Bench-Tek</strong> (Founder: Maria Castellon) &#8211; A manufacturer of lab benches that focuses on using environmentally friendly materials.</li>
<li><strong>Vericool</strong> (Founder: Darrell Jobe) &#8211; Aims to make sustainable alternatives to Styrofoam and other packaging products, and makes a point of hiring formerly incarcerated folks.</li>
<li><strong>Oceti Sakowin Power Authority</strong> (Chairman: Lyle Jack) &#8211; Not a company per se, but an NGO formed by six Sioux tribes dedicated to developing renewable energy in the Midwest and on reservations.</li>
<li><strong>Mosaic Global Transportation</strong> (Founder: Maurice H. Brewster) &#8211; Supplies employee and event shuttles and other vehicles with an aim to replace gas-operated ones with EVs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The businesses we’re partnering with today are poised to become tomorrow’s diverse and innovative industry leaders, creating ripples of change to help communities everywhere adapt to the urgent challenges posed by climate change,&#8221; said Apple&#8217;s VP of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, in the announcement.</p>

		Leonardo Lanna is head of payment products at <a href="https://www.monkey.exchange/">Monkey Exchange</a>, a Brazilian marketplace startup that enables sellers to offer receivables from sales in a single platform to many buyers at once, receiving the best price with low effort. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Something strange is afoot in Brazil, and it promises great changes for how merchants get paid.</p>
<p>This the story of one regulator, the Brazilian Central Bank, and how it has taken center stage in creating a framework that will have far-reaching effects across merchants and fintechs in this fast-growing Latin American nation.</p>
<p>But first, some background: Unlike in the rest of the world, when a credit card is used for payment in Brazil, the merchant does not receive the funds owed to them all at once. Instead, nearly 50% of card sales are completed in monthly installments, leaving the sellers to manage a difficult cash flow process.</p>
<p>The most common solution for merchants is that they end up selling the remaining receivable at a discount — taking less than they are owed — in order to get their money sooner. And we’re not talking about a small-volume market: Some R$2 trillion (Brazilian Reais) in card transactions were processed in 2020.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This compelling new regulatory framework brings new opportunities for many players willing to participate in receivables discounting operations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like in practice: Let&#8217;s say Maria purchases a few articles of clothing from retailer Clothing Incorporated. When paying via her credit card at checkout, Maria can choose to pay in two to 12 installments. Maria decides to pay the balance of R$620 over six installments.</p>
<p>While Maria is happy with the products in hand, Clothing Incorporated is without the full payment — and for small merchants in particular, the difficulties associated with limited working capital can be acute. Clothing Incorporated can either wait the full six months to be paid, receiving payments from their merchant acquirer each month until they are paid in full, or they can choose to dramatically discount the amount they are owed and not have to wait the six months.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say Clothing Incorporated merchant acquirer is ExMarko — instead of receiving R$620 over six months (net of any merchant discount rates), they could receive R$520 within days after the purchase, with ExMarko pocketing the rest when it comes in. This comes at a steep cost of doing business to the merchant, with an implied annualized interest rate that sometimes can reach  ~70% — for a risk-free operation, since the acquirer is only liquidating earlier its own obligation to pay the merchant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s no secret that Google is in the midst of a pretty massive overhaul of its Pixel division. The Pixel 6 offers the next major Hail Mary for the company’s hardware division, complete with its own custom chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>This is not that. The new flagship won’t be available until the fall. Meantime, here’s the 5a, the latest addition to the “budget flagship” line that’s proven a nice overall sales boost for a struggling department.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190622" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190622" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png" alt="" width="1000" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=768,295 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=680,261 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190622" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google confirmed the phone’s existence back in April, mostly as a way of curbing rumors prematurely predicting the unannounced handset’s death. “Pixel 5a 5G is not canceled,” the company told TechCrunch at the time. “It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>And, indeed, here it is. The handset officially goes on sale August 26 for $449. <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel5a-with-5g-new-google-phone/">The Pixel 5a with 5G</a> is, in a word, “safe” &#8212; a fact highlighted by the recent announcement of the Pixel 6. This is very much not a phone from a company looking to shake things up, but rather, the remnants of a division that was content to play right down the middle in the smartphone wars. Safe isn’t a bad word &#8212; particularly not at this price point. It’s sturdy (now with IP67 water resistance!) and it’ll get the job done.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5QXH9M16St"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/google-denies-pixel-5a-5g-cancelation-confirming-its-coming-this-year/">Google denies Pixel 5a 5G cancelation, confirming it’s coming this year</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As the name very clearly implies, the price includes 5G connectivity. That’s coupled with a dual-camera &#8212; with the same 12- and 16-megapixel setup as the Pixel 5. Those perform a slew of software-enabled modes, including Night Sight, Live HDR+ and Portrait Light. The phone is powered by the same mid-tier Snapdragon 765G process, while the RAM has been reduced down to 6GB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Storage is the same at 128GB and, interestingly, the battery has actually been bumped up from 4080 mAh to 4680. The screen, too, has been expanded from 6.0 to 6.34 inches, with the same resolution. It drops the Pixel 5’s wireless charging, but hey, there’s a headphone jack.</p>
<p>The Pixel 5a with 5G is up for preorder starting today.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">IKEA won&#8217;t just sell you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-28-ikea-smart-lighting-range-uk.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">smart lights</a> — it&#8217;ll soon sell you the electricity to power those lights, provided you live in the right country. <em>Electrek</em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/17/ikea-is-now-selling-clean-energy-to-swedish-households-no-allen-key-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">notes</a> that IKEA has <a href="https://www.ingka.com/news/sweden-first-ikea-market-to-start-offering-electricity-from-wind-and-solar-through-stromma-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">revealed</a> plans to sell clean energy to Swedish homes through a Strömma subscription service. Pay the (as yet unmentioned) fee and you&#8217;ll get certified solar- or wind-generated electricity with usage you can track through a mobile app.</p>
<p>The home furnishings giant didn&#8217;t say whether it would expand the clean energy sales to other countries, although it hoped to let people &#8220;use and generate&#8221; renewable energy in &#8220;all our Ingka Group markets&#8221; by 2025. The company already sells solar panels.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The retailer is no stranger to eco-friendly efforts. It stopped selling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-01-ikea-to-sell-only-led-based-lighting-by-2016.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">non-LED lights</a> and will soon drop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-stop-selling-alkaline-batteries-by-october-2021-153546827.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">non-rechargeable alkaline batteries</a>. It&#8217;s even planning to turn a Swedish city <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-swedish-sustainable-community-152015989.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">into a sustainable community</a>. And there&#8217;s little doubt this will help burnish IKEA&#8217;s public image. It can address concerns about the chain&#8217;s environmental impact by serving as a clean energy source.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a significant move, though, and we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other larger stores followed suit. It&#8217;s not just a feel-good effort that could reduce emissions — sales of excess clean energy could recoup costs and boost profits.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We are brainstorming a new solution to a widespread challenge in many countries: How to develop a self-sustaining, independent local tech ecosystem. We propose that governments should systematically support funding for their diaspora founders, not just founders locally.</p>
<p>There are three main players in any tech ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first are founders who want to build companies and need funding. In many ecosystems outside of the major tech hubs, founders face cultural, legal, reputational and other hurdles to building a successful tech company. As a result, many of them emigrate to the U.S. Immigrants contribute to the success of the U.S. innovation economy at a vastly <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/kauffman_compilation_immigration_entrepreneurship.pdf">disproportionate</a> rate.</li>
<li>Next are VC firms looking for founders. In a very small number of geographies, there is no shortage of VC funds (NY, CA, Boston, Israel, Beijing). But in most cities in the world, there is only a relatively small number of VC funds.</li>
<li>Then you have national and local governmental organizations interested in promoting economic growth and job creation. They particularly want to see a thriving tech ecosystem generating high-paid jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our proposal is that many governments that are not major tech hubs (i.e., most countries excluding the U.S., China, Israel and India) should stop restricting themselves to supporting locally domiciled VC funds.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Many countries’ governments (Canada, France, etc.) have created or supported funds to invest in local VC managers. Usually, governments have a two-part goal: Achieve good returns and generate jobs. However, in many cases, these VC funds have failed on one or both counts.</p>
<p>There is a reason the definitive book on the topic has such a depressing title: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boulevard-Broken-Dreams-Entrepreneurship-Failed/dp/0691154538">&#8220;Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Why Public Efforts to Boost Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Have Failed — and What to Do about It,&#8221;</a> by my former professor, Josh Lerner, head of the entrepreneurial management unit and the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking at Harvard Business School.</p>
<blockquote><p>Silicon Valley, Singapore, Tel Aviv ― the global hubs of entrepreneurial activity ―all bear the marks of government investment. Yet, for every public intervention that spurs entrepreneurial activity, there are many failed efforts that waste untold billions in taxpayer dollars … [The book] reveals the common flaws undermining far too many programs ― poor design, a lack of understanding for the entrepreneurial process, and implementation problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our proposal is that many governments that are not major tech hubs (i.e., most countries excluding the U.S., China, Israel and India) should stop restricting themselves to supporting locally domiciled VC funds. Instead, they should consider investing in VC funds that invest in their diaspora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We argue that this benefits the home country in three ways:</p>
<p><strong>Remittances:</strong> Entrepreneurs will send money home to their families.</p>
<p><strong>Brain gain:</strong> If you look at the leaders of the tech ecosystem in most countries, you will see a very disproportionate number of people who have education and work experience abroad, especially in the U.S. Diaspora entrepreneurs bring the knowledge and understanding acquired outside the country that may help them see possibilities not apparent to people who have not lived elsewhere. On the other hand, these entrepreneurs often encounter entrenched attitudes, resentment from non-migrants, and administrative barriers in bringing money, materials and equipment from abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Job creation:</strong> Even if a French emigrant starts their business in New York, when they expand, France will be a logical place for a European HQ. In addition, as the firm grows, there are many functions they may set up in their home country, such as engineering, QA and customer support.</p>
<p>The private sector has already identified this opportunity. In New York City, there already exist numerous VC funds with particular interest in certain diasporas. For Israel, we have <a href="http://www.elevatorfund.com/">Elevator Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.hanacovc.com/">Hanaco</a>, <a href="http://www.innovationendeavors.com/">Innovation Endeavors</a>, <a href="http://janvest.com/">JANVEST Capital Partners</a>, <a href="http://www.peregventures.com/">Pereg Ventures</a>, <a href="https://team8.vc/">Team8</a>, numerous others. See <a href="https://www.israel21c.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-us-investor-programs-in-israeli-startups/">&#8220;The ultimate guide to US investment in Israeli startups.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For the Canadian diaspora, you have <a href="https://inovia.vc/">iNovia Capital</a> and <a href="http://hofvc.com">HOF Capital</a> for people from MENA, while <a href="http://fvc.com">ff Venture Capital</a> looks at Poland.</p>
<p>Governments could model these efforts on leading global public/private organizations that have supported diaspora entrepreneurs in many other ways.</p>
<p><strong>Networking, mentoring and training:</strong> Governments can offer opportunities for diaspora and local business leaders to meet one another and discuss potential business and investment opportunities in the homeland. Many of these groups also offer startup services such as market research, business plan advisory, matching with seasoned executives and registering a business. A few such groups are the <a href="https://africandiasporanetwork.org/">African Diaspora Network</a> (ADN), <a href="https://tie.org/">The Indus Entrepreneurs</a> (TiE) (Southeast Asia), <a href="https://advance.org">Advance</a> (Australia) based in New York, <a href="https://www.thec100.org/">C100</a> (focused on Canadian tech leaders), <a href="https://www.globalscot.com/home">GlobalScot</a>, <a href="https://www.ireland101.com/mentoring/register">Irish Executive Mentorship Program</a> and <a href="https://www.gob.mx/ime/acciones-y-programas/red-global-mx">Red de Talentos Mexicanos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investment</strong> (almost entirely in the home country): Investment is typically in the form of pooled private and public funds, or matching grants, and typically requires a physical presence in the home country. A few such organizations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.afford-uk.org/">African Foundation for Development</a> (AFFORD) was founded in 1994 as a nonprofit organization by Africans living in the U.K. to help expatriates there create wealth and jobs back home. Its investment activities include the Diaspora Finance Initiative (DFI), AFFORD Diaspora Grants and the AFFORD Business Club.</li>
<li>Moldova has a <a href="https://www.odimm.md/ro/pare">Pare 1+1</a> program that offers funding and entrepreneurial training to immigrants (and returnees) into Moldova.</li>
<li><a href="https://chileglobalventures.cl/portafolio/">Chile Global Ventures</a> (part of Fundación Chile) finances startups through its network of over 100 influential Chileans living in the U.S., Canada and Europe. They invest in Chilean startups or companies abroad founded by Chileans.</li>
<li><a href="https://migrationsmartpractices.ifrc.org/smart-practice/fondo-concursable-el-cucayo-ecuador/">Ecuador’s Fund El Cucayo</a> provides risk capital in a matching-funding format, 50-50 or 25-75, to returning Ecuadorian entrepreneurs in Ecuador.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recruiting new citizens: </strong>The Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html">Startup Visa Program</a> is great for recruiting international talent. This is an enormous opportunity for Canada to further leverage its historic openness to immigrants. From my point of view as an American, our history of welcoming immigrants (including my French father) is one of our greatest advantages compared to our geopolitical rivals. We’re fools if we don’t aggressively leverage this unique asset.</p>
<p>So here’s our question: Which forward-thinking governments are open to the idea of supporting funding to their diaspora? In our conversations with some senior government officials outside of the U.S., what we’ve heard is, “We love the idea, but it would be difficult to get political support for anything that involves sending money abroad.”</p>
<p>Who can surmount this challenge?</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There are many high-quality tech companies being built in Brazil with very experienced management teams and very exciting stories that will capture the hearts and wallets of Brazilian … investors."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil’s startup market is reaching new heights, and its domestic stock market could benefit from the boom.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/07/venture-pulse-q2-2021.pdf">data from KPMG</a>, Brazilian startups raised the most capital in a single quarter in Q1 2021, when some $1.4 billion flowed into domestic technology upstarts. That record stood until the second quarter of 2021 saw $2.7 billion raised by Brazilian startups.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Inflows are only half of the startup equation, however. Brazil has seen notable acquisitions in recent years, including <a href="https://contxto.com/en/brazil/silicon-valley-twilio-buys-brazilian-startup-teravoz/">Twilio buying Teravoz in January 2020</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/etsy-acquires-elo7-known-as-the-etsy-of-brazil-for-217m/">Etsy buying Elo7</a> in June for more than $200 million. Magazine Luiza <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kabum-m-a-magazine-luiza/brazils-magazine-luiza-to-buy-e-commerce-retailer-kabum-for-200-million-idUSKBN2EL1FU">spent $528 million to buy Kabum</a>, a Brazilian e-commerce player, earlier this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Acquisitions are merely one path to liquidity, however. IPOs are another. The good news for Brazil and its startup ecosystem is that despite a historical dearth of technology public offerings on domestic exchanges, the IPO market for Brazilian tech startups could be gearing up for more volume.</p>
<p>GetNinjas, a platform for hiring local labor for household needs like plumbing and painting, went public earlier this year on the B3 exchange, located in São Paulo. And it’s not alone.</p>
<p>The IPO market in Brazil is changing, data indicates. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/will-brazils-roaring-20s-see-the-rise-of-early-stage-startups/">noted last year</a> that in the decade leading up to 2020, just two of the 56 IPOs in Brazil were technology companies. More recently, the number of technology companies listed in the country <a href="https://invest.exame.com/me/empresas-de-tecnologia-dominam-ipos-e-quadruplicam-em-dois-anos-na-b3">has swelled to at least 16</a>, up from just four in 2019.</p>
<p>Will the trend of domestic IPOs continue for Brazilian technology companies? Or will U.S. IPOs play a preeminent role for the country’s leading tech startups?</p>
<p>The question is not idle, with São Paulo-based fintech giant Nubank heading toward an eventual public offering and more capital than ever wagered on the country’s current generation of startups, all of which must aspire to the most famous of exit paths. Brazil is also minting new unicorns, with <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/unico-becomes-a-new-brazilian-unicorn-and-the-fifth-invested-by-softbank/">at least four graduating</a> to the valuation threshold this year alone.</p>
<p>But even that data point is outdated: Just this morning, Nuvemshop, a Brazilian e-commerce company, announced a <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/nuvemshop-new-unicorn/">new $500 million round</a> valuing it at more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>To better understand the recently expanding number of domestically listed Brazilian technology offerings, and what could be ahead for the country’s startups, The Exchange spoke to GetNinjas CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardolhotellier/?originalSubdomain=br">Eduardo L&#8217;Hotellier</a> about its IPO and <a href="https://twitter.com/rquintini">Renata Quintini</a> from <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/">Renegade Partners</a>, a venture capital firm, about what’s happening in the country. We’ll lean on data as we go. Let’s explore Brazil!</p>
<h2>What’s driving rising technology IPO volume in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The number of public companies, overall depressed compared to historical highs in the Brazilian market, is impacted by both sector-specific and more macro trends. When we consider what is driving more technology offerings in Brazil, we’ll want to think about larger macroeconomic factors along with what’s happening in technology more specifically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans — the platform where adult creators can directly monetize their audience — is pushing its safe-for-work app OFTV, which is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oftv/id1521600438">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zype.oftvandroid&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>. The ad-free app launched in January, sharing over 800 videos from OnlyFans creators, like cooking tutorials, yoga routines, and interviews. But this week will be the first time that OnlyFans will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost">market the app</a> to reach people who aren&#8217;t existing OnlyFans customers.</p>
<p>“There’s no adult content on OFTV. Because it’s not being monetized and there’s no direct impact on creators’ earnings, we are able to be in the app store,&#8221; OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokley told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost">Bloomberg</a>. The App Store and Google Play both prohibit pornography, but in the case of apps with user-generated content (like Reddit), NSFW content can slide as long as it&#8217;s labelled as such and hidden by default. OnlyFans, as it exists on the web, hasn&#8217;t been approved on Apple&#8217;s App Store or Google Play.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190588" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190588" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="750" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=1536,1227 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OFTV (screenshots by TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>OnlyFans is profitable, but to continue to grow, it is seeking funding at a valuation of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/onlyfans-is-said-to-seek-funding-at-valuation-above-1-billion?sref=lAVQtUwz">over $1 billion</a>. Per Bloomberg, OnlyFans wants to become a more mainstream platform in order to solicit advertisers that may be worried about its adult reputation. Even celebrities like Cardi B and athlete Floyd Mayweather Jr. have joined OnlyFans. In March 2020, the app also launched a Creative Fund, which rewarded four musical artists with a <a href="https://blog.onlyfans.com/meet-the-winners-of-the-creative-fund/">£20,000 grant</a>. Plus, the &#8220;<a href="https://blog.onlyfans.com/july-2021-rising-stars-on-onlyfans/">rising stars</a>&#8221; the app features on its blog include songwriters, photographers, stylists, personal trainers, and chefs. Its effort to highlight SFW creators is clear, and the promotion of OFTV supports that.</p>
<p>The platform has paid out over $3 billion in creator earnings since its founding in 2016 — in particular, revenue grew <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/onlyfans-lockdown-boom-transactions-hit-24b-revenue-up-553-2021-4">over 553%</a> in 2020, when many people turned to OnlyFans for an income stream in a time of pandemic-induced financial strain. OnlyFans takes 20% from creators&#8217; earnings, and comparatively, Patreon charges between 5-12%, while Cameo takes 25%. Even if OnlyFans were accepted to app stores — NSFW content and all — it may not even be good for creators, who would then lose an extra 30% to app store fees on top of the platform&#8217;s 20% cut. But OFTV doesn&#8217;t sell content or allow unsolicited users to upload videos, so its apparent purpose is to generate more excitement around non-pornographic OnlyFans content.</p>
<p>To appeal to SFW creators, OnlyFans might have to shed its image (for those concerned with that), but perhaps more importantly, the platform would need to show that it is a particularly profitable space for creators. Its sales speak volumes, but that could have more to do with the booming creator economy and the nature of the content it hosts, rather than the platform itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Kate Ryder, the founder of women’s health clinic and benefits platform Maven, business is personal. During the first year of building her company, Ryder experienced a miscarriage. Maven began offering support for pregnancy loss and high-risk care management as the founder herself waded through the emotions and confusion of it.</p>
<p>Ryder was then a Maven “customer” for her following three pregnancies, using the platform for after-hours advice, virtual access to specialists or, more recently, guidance on how to prepare for a breech birth. As a founder-turned-repeat-customer, Ryder gained a key perspective on parenthood: it’s a diverse experience.</p>
<p>The insights were poured back into her business, a platform that offers services addressing everything from fertility to family care. And today, Maven is making history in its own way.</p>
<p>Maven announced that it has raised $110 million in a Series D financing co-led by Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital. BOND also participated in the round, alongside existing investors, including Sequoia, Oak HC/FT and Icon Ventures. Oprah Winfrey also invested in the round, bringing Maven’s total known funding to date to $200 million.</p>
<p>The financing event valued Maven at $1 billion, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">a rare landmark</a> moment for women’s health, and women-led startups more broadly.</p>
<h2>Maven</h2>
<p>After raising one of the largest Series C rounds <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maven-raises-45-million-in-series-c-one-of-the-largest-funding-rounds-for-female-led-womens-and-family-health-company-301007525.html">for women’s health startups in 2020</a>, Maven’s latest financing came after some strong growth.</p>
<p>The startup said that it has partnered with five new Fortune 15 clients, including Microsoft, and has achieved a near 100% retention rate. While the company didn’t disclose client growth more specifically, it did say that membership in its employer and payer-sponsored clinical problems increased 400% year over year &#8212; suggesting that revenue similarly grew as the company hit larger scale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While COVID-19 refocused women’s health as a top priority, Maven began when that wasn’t a baseline assumption. The company was founded in 2014 to help working women plan and start families. It started by selling to employers as a benefits platform, which it still does today &#8212; the idea being that women could turn to their employers to get access to a network of women’s health and family health provider networks.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=qNudwhKIg7" data-secret="qNudwhKIg7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The focus has aged well as companies rethink health benefits in the wake of the coronavirus, which has disproportionately seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/women-pandemic-harris.html">women depart from the workforce</a>. Ryder says this wasn’t always the case, noting how many rejections she got in the early years of building.</p>
<p>After five years, Maven has grown to offer support services ranging from preconception to post-pregnancy to family care. Companies are able to offer their employees access to 30 different provider types, which include OB-GYNs, pediatricians, therapists and career coaches. Because the options can be overwhelming, Maven also introduced care advocates &#8212; people whose entire job it is to support existing patients in navigating the resources.</p>
<p>“For anyone who says that telemedicine isn&#8217;t important in this user journey is somebody who is not really deeply immersed in the needs of the patient,” Ryder said. “A new mom, particularly in childbirth recovery, has a baby and can&#8217;t really get out of bed and has all of these needs&#8230; There’s no better time to use telemedicine.”</p>
<p>More than 2,000 doctors, caretakers and specialists exist in Maven’s network, a total that represents over 250 subspecialties, from egg donor consultants to fertility awareness educators. The startup has served over 10 million women and families to date.</p>
<p>A growing focus for Maven is being able to match its members to providers who are culturally aware and relatable to them. Black women, for example, face higher mortality rates compared to their white counterparts &#8212;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/"> a factoid that seeded another startup</a>, Expectful, to pivot its focus.</p>
<p>Ryder said that 40% of Maven’s providers are BIPOC, and can speak across 30 languages.</p>
<p>Even with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">introduction of white-labeling services</a> that make it easier for competitors to spin up telehealth services overnight, Ryder said Maven wants to stick to hiring in a more incremental way. The startup accepts about 35% of provider applications that it gets, she said.</p>
<p>“If we were starting today, we’d look at [outsourcing] platforms because we’d need it to compete in the market &#8212; we have the benefit of starting in 2014, when we were able to take our time and just be really thoughtful about the types of providers that work with Maven.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/embed/#?secret=T4eicq1s5n" data-secret="T4eicq1s5n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The rise of competition makes Maven’s status as a unicorn more broadly relevant, with investors thinking it could prove opportunity in women’s health and give the growing sector a fresh consolidator to acquire some startups.</p>
<h2>The rising tide</h2>
<p>Maven’s raise wasn’t only a milestone from a fundraising perspective, but also a board perspective. Most of the startup’s investors are women and mothers, she noted &#8212; a bright spot when looking at data that suggests that nearly half of private companies don’t even <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2020-diversity-study-on-private-company-boards/">have a woman on the board at all. </a></p>
<p>Deena Shakir, partner at lead investor Lux Capital, said this was her largest check to date into a startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dmpQY6psdI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">Mental wellness platform Lyra Health is raising up to $175M at a $2.25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental wellness platform Lyra Health is raising up to $175M at a $2.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=dmpQY6psdI" data-secret="dmpQY6psdI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The idea of the woman as the primary decision maker in healthcare is just part of my overall thesis around women&#8217;s health,” Shakir said. “A woman is more than just, obviously, her reproductive identity &#8212; that’s for sure.” As well-funded startups in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">mental health</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">musculoskeletal</a> worlds &#8212; two other top priorities for employers &#8212; kept growing, Shakir felt like maternal health was the last top cost center that employers needed to address.</p>
<p>Maven is compelling to Shakir because of how comprehensive it is, which she thinks is increasingly important as new vendors and point solutions enter the market and exhaust employers through decision fatigue.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just in maternity and it&#8217;s not just in fertility, and not just in pedes or mental health,” she added. Maven’s language is already starting to look more broad in branding, moving from women’s health to family and child health. “There’s also male infertility, couples therapy, and beyond the gender binary&#8230;it&#8217;s very sensitive to providing inclusive care for everyone.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Ro’s acquisition of Modern Fertility</a> showed that hormonal health and women’s health are being looked at as an attractive opportunity for digital health startups more broadly.</p>
<p>“Ro started off as men’s health,” Shakir said. “I’m excited for when it’s going to be the women&#8217;s health company that&#8217;s going to be making the other, you know, several $100 million acquisitions here.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Christina Farr</a> covered the rise of digital health as a journalist for CNBC before leaving her post to become an investor at OMERS Ventures, which does not have a stake in Maven.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A2waK0F0bk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/embed/#?secret=A2waK0F0bk" data-secret="A2waK0F0bk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As a reporter, Farr said that one of the things she would often hear is that women’s health was too niche as an investment category.</p>
<p>“Which is obviously upsetting, and just not true,” Farr said. “How could you ever refer to 50% of the population as niche on top of the fact that women are the primary buyers of healthcare services in their household &#8212; to me that’s just an ignorant perspective.”</p>
<p>Farr said that she’s not aware of any other companies in the digital health, women’s health space that have raised this much money with a female-founder. “I believe at this stage, the CEO became a man,” she said, of another startup. Long-term, Farr thinks that Maven has the potential to bring together a lot of the different point solutions for women and family health under one roof, whether it&#8217;s postpartum recovery or physical health.</p>
<p>“In my mind, these companies can exist in their own right, but there&#8217;s also an incredible value to pulling together all of us in one kind of platform in one place,” she said. “I think a big kind of potential area for Maven is to be a navigator for all the women’s health solutions that are out there.”</p>
<p>Ryder maintains that her personal experience has given her a lot of opinions &#8212; ones that she thinks have helped the company stay focused, even in the wake of new competition and potential acquisitions.</p>
<p>“We know what we stand for, we know what we do for patients, we know that our care model works, and so we&#8217;re unwilling to kind of bend,” she said. “If there’s the latest shininess that everyone goes rushing for that doesn’t help the patient, then we’re not going to run towards it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monterey Car Week wrapped up on Sunday with the return of the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance. A black 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurrier took top honors at the show, now in its 70th year, held on the golf course overlooking the Pacific Ocean. But it was the electric hypercars and high-performance hybrids, not the historics that stood out this year.</p>
<p>Over the years, the glitz and glam of Pebble Beach has ballooned into a week of activities around racing, displaying, parading and selling cars throughout the picturesque Monterey Peninsula. Last year, car week was canceled. This year, despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Champagne was flowing.</p>
<p>When the New York Auto Show was canceled earlier in the month due to concerns over the presence of the delta variant, there was speculation that Pebble would also be canceled. But it snuck through as the de facto show that must go on before the uncertainty of the fall season amid pandemic shutdowns.</p>

The 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurier, winner of the Best of Show award at the 2021 Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance in Pebble Beach on Aug. 15, 2021.</p></div></p>
<p>On the days leading up to the Concours, the streets of Carmel and Monterey were quieter and less busy, and there seemed to be fewer old cars driving around. There were plenty of modern Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Ferraris revving their engines in parking lots. Many guests slipped masks on and off at gatherings, which were mostly held outside, despite misty rain and cool temperatures. By Sunday, the crowds were back in full force for the Concours, which seemed as packed as ever.</p>
<p>The main event, the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance, was once dedicated to restored pre-war classic cars. But as generations and tastes shifted, newer cars were featured on the green. The attendees also seemed younger; high-performance sports cars dominated the scene.</p>
<p>A 1995 McLaren F1 was auctioned for a record-breaking $20 million at the Gooding &amp; Company auction on Friday night. Meanwhile, automakers hurriedly pulled together splashy car launches of their limited edition high-dollar supercars for the media and their top customers who milled about at private events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Pebble Beach is an important pillar,&#8221; said Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani. &#8220;Pebble Beach told us what people love in terms of the aesthetic of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most notably, Audi showed the futuristic Skysphere concept on Wednesday. Mercedes-Benz previewed a new California-style convertible SL on Friday, which won&#8217;t be officially revealed until September. Aston Martin showed its Valkyrie and Valhalla models on a generous stand overlooking the golf course at Pebble Beach, but only allowed media and serious, vetted customers a close look at its models.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Rimac Automobili and Lucid Group showed up at Pebble Beach to connect with potential customers that can afford to invest in the most pricy electric powertrains. Rimac used the podium to debut its blistering fast Nevera sports car. Monterey 2021 seemed to have shifted to where new cars and new player overtook the old on the periphery. </span></p>
<p>After a year of pent-up demand for super luxury cars, it was the perfect setting for showing off all of those pandemic purchases on the race track and roads in and around Monterey and Carmel. As auction prices soared and seven-figure sports car sold out, it became clear that performance car enthusiasm hasn&#8217;t waned. The new cars shown at Pebble Beach share much in common: All are pricey, packed with sports car technology and manufactured in low volumes. Here are some of the highlights.</p>
<h2>Aston Martin</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190459" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190459" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190459 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit</strong>: Tamara Warren</p></div></p>
<p>After several delays in recent years, the Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider was unveiled as a sold-out car by new CEO Tobias Moers. The Valkyrie has removable roof panels and a top speed of 217 miles per hour. Moers, who took the role over the pandemic, has been making drastic changes to the way Aston produces its cars.</p>
<p>Moers said that adding new in-car technology is essential to the brand&#8217;s future, and will pivot away from using last generation Mercedes-Benz tech. Also on display at the Aston stand was the 2024 Valhalla, which will have a hybrid powertrain.</p>
<h2>Audi Skysphere</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190465" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190465" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190465 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg" alt="Audi Skysphere" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg. The Audi AG Skysphere electric concept car during The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, in Carmel, California.</p></div></p>
<p>The self-driving Skysphere concept looked more like it belonged at the CES show than a vintage car concours. It stuck out as the most interesting car unveiled at Pebble Beach. Audi says it can slim down its wheelbase from a larger car into a small roadster.</p>
<h2>Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190476" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190476" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190476 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg" alt="Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner " width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190476" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Bentley. Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner.</p></div></p>
<p>While the luxe interior of the Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner drew compliments for its lush leather, news that would include a hybrid powertrain is significant for Bentley.</p>
<h2>Bugatti Bolide</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190487" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190487" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190487 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg" alt="Buggati -Winkelmann" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit</strong>: Bugatti. Stephan Winkelmann, president of Bugatti Automobiles, stands next to the Bugatti Bolide at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, in 2021.</p></div></p>
<p>The Bolide wasn&#8217;t at Pebble, but announced at a press conference held at The Quail on Friday. For the ultra-exclusive automaker, a new car is a big deal, especially one that will be its last gasoline-powered car. Bugatti says it will make 40 Bolides priced at $4 million apiece. It will have a top speed of 300 miles per hour.</p>
<h2>Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190466" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190466" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190466 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg" alt="Lamborghini SpA Countach" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234663023.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190466" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg. A Lamborghini SpA Countach during The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering.</p></div></p>
<p>The Countach paid homage to the iconic model 50 years after the marque debuted. Under the hood, it&#8217;s an all-new car with a hybrid powertrain capable of reaching 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds.</p>
<h2>Acura NSX Type S</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190480" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190480" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190480 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2022-Acura-NSX-Type-S_010.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Acura.

<p>Acura introduced a high-end hybrid version of its super car, the NSX, <span style="font-weight: 400;">an outgoing variant of the model that will soon cease to exist</span>. It plans to manufacture only 350 cars and price the car starting at roughly $171,000.</p>
<h2>Rimac Nevera</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190558" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190558" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190558 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg" alt="Rimac Nevera 2021" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rimac-GettyImages-1234662800.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190558" class="wp-caption-text">A Rimac Nevera luxury electric supercar during The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering in Carmel, California on Aug. 13, 2021. <strong>Image credit</strong>: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rimac stamped its mark on Monterey with its U.S. debut of the Nevera, a $2.44 million electric super car. Rimac says Nevera will run up to 400 miles on full  charge, at a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Rimac’s buzzy presence around town is a reminder that while Pebble Beach was once about the past, there’s a hunger for new EV players that can outrun the competition. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just five months after raising $90M, Brazil’s Nuvemshop announced today it has raised $500 million in a round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values Nuvemshop – which some say is Latin America’s answer to Shopify – at $3.1 billion and brings the Sao Paulo-based startup’s total funding in the last 10 months to more than $620 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunley House Capital and VMG Partners, as well as existing backers Accel, Kaszek, Kevin Efrusy, Qualcomm Ventures LLC and ThornTree Capital also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop (also known as Tiendanube in Spanish speaking countries) aims to give entrepreneurs a way to build and grow online businesses. The company’s platform serves more than 90,000 merchants across Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, ranging from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to more established brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong, Colombraro, Zaira Beauty, Osram, Lolja, Vitabe and StrappyCo. That’s up from 20,000 merchants at the start of 2020 and 80,000 at the time of its last raise in March.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nuvemshop, LatAm&#8217;s answer to Shopify, raises $90M in Accel-led Series D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/nuvemshop-latams-answer-to-shopify-raises-90m-in-accel-led-series-d/embed/#?secret=FyZ8IdnCyb" data-secret="FyZ8IdnCyb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Nuvemshop launched a beta version of its own payments solution platform for merchants that is designed to allow for “faster and more secure” purchases. It also reflects the Latin American consumers&#8217; approach to paying for retail purchases over time. In fact, the company says that 70% of the credit card transactions on its platform happen via installments. The new product will be made broadly available to all merchants over the course of the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop says that its logistics capabilities allow merchants to deliver directly to consumers via partnerships and integrations with what would otherwise be a highly fragmented network of carriers. The company plans to keep broadening its set of warehouse and carrier partners with the goal of driving down the click-to-delivery time in most regions — now typically 5 to 6 days — to 1- or 2-day delivery, which is now standard in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With 650 million consumers, <span class="xn-location">Latin America</span> is not only a huge market, but it is the fastest growing e-commerce market in the world,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Matt Gatto</span>, managing director at Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Accel Partner Ethan Choi believes the Latin American e-commerce market has the potential to be just as big as the U.S. market in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the rapid adoption of e-commerce, we believe Nuvemshop has the potential to be one of the most important companies in the region,<br />
he told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Looking at Shopify&#8217;s $185 billion market cap gives you a sense of what&#8217;s possible if you&#8217;re the leading eCommerce player in a big market like the U.S.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward growth in Nuvemshop’s existing markets and support expansion into new countries such as Colombia, Chile and Perú. Nuvemshop will also work to expand its capabilities to serve larger merchants by expanding its sales and customer support staff, as well as continuing to invest in resources and support for its app partners and agencies. The company additionally plans to accelerate its payment and logistics capabilities, and will use the fresh capital in part toward some acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has more than 600 employees and offices in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">InfoSum, a London-based startup that provides a decentralized platform for secure data sharing between organizations, has secured a $65 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chrysalis/">Chrysalis Investments</a>.</p>
<p>The investment comes less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/infosum-raises-15-1m-for-its-privacy-first-federated-approach-to-big-data-analytics/">InfoSum closed a $15.1 million Series A round co-led by Upfront Ventures and IA Ventures</a>. Since, the data privacy startup has tripled its revenue, doubled its employee base, and secured more than fifty new customers, including AT&amp;T, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a>, Omnicom and Merkle.</p>
<p>Its growth was boosted by businesses that are increasingly focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>, largely as a result of the mass shift to remote working and cloud-based collaboration necessitated by the pandemic. InfoSum’s data collaboration platform uses patented technology to connect customer records between and amongst companies, without moving or sharing data. It helps organizations to alleviate security concerns, according to the startup, and is compliant with all current privacy laws, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>The platform was bolstered earlier this year with the launch of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/infosum-outs-an-identity-linking-tool-thats-exciting-marketing-firms-like-experian/"> InfoSum Bridge</a>, a product which it claims significantly expands the customer identity linking capabilities of its platform. It is designed to connect advertising identifiers along with its own &#8220;bunkered&#8221; data sets to better facilitate ad targeting based on first-party data.</p>
<p>“The technology that enables companies to safely and securely compare customer data is thankfully entering a new phase, driven by privacy-conscious consumers and companies focused on value and control. InfoSum is proud to be leading the way,” said Brian Lesser, chairman and CEO of InfoSum. “Companies are looking for solutions to help resolve the existing friction and inefficiencies around data collaboration, and InfoSum is the company to drive this growth forward.”</p>
<p>The company, which says it is poised for &#8220;exponential growth” in 2021 as businesses continue to embrace privacy-focused tools and software, will use the newly raised investment to accelerate hiring across every aspect of its business, expand into new regions, and further the development of its platform.</p>
<p>Nick Halstead, who previously founded and led big data startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/datasift/">DataSift</a>, founded InfoSum (then called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/cognitivelogic-raises-3m-to-help-enterprises-pool-big-data-while-keeping-privacy-intact/">CognitiveLogic</a>) in 2015 with a vision to connect the world’s data without ever sharing it. The company currently has 80 employees spread across offices in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some Bluetooth bugginess and questionable mic performance aside, I liked the NuraTrue quite a bit. And obviously, I’m always in favor of smaller companies mixing it up with tech giants, while bringing something unique to the process. In Nura’s case, that thing is custom sound profiles that can dramatically enhance the listening experience.</p>
<p>The company has also been a proponent of the hardware-as-a-service model. It’s a concept we’ve written about quite a bit that has yet to really catch fire with a broader audience. You pay some money up front and then effectively rent the product for a monthly fee. The company is extending the model to its NuraBuds product.</p>
<p>The fully wireless headphones shouldn’t be confused with the NuraTrue (honestly, though, the NuraBuds name is the better of the two). The devices are remarkably similar, but these are cheaper (and smaller) versions that drop some of the features in the name of keeping the cost down. They&#8217;re not unlike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/googles-much-improved-pixel-buds-are-finally-here/">Google&#8217;s Pixel Buds A</a>, in that respect.</p>
<p>The smaller size (which also drops the largely ornament circle design) also comes with a reduced battery, down from six hours to four on the buds (plus 10 additional hours via the case). How big a difference that will make to you, the user, really depends on how you use the buds. The other big difference is the NuraBuds can’t be used to perform the company’s signature hearing test.</p>
<p>Instead, users will have to use the app to import it from a different model. Essentially that means missing out on their best feature, unless you&#8217;ve already owned (or rented) another set of Nura headphones and saved that profile.</p>
<p>If that all sounds good, the buds run $5 a month through the Nuranow program, plus a $19 upfront “one-time setup” fee. The over-ear Nuraphones are also available through the program for $10 a month (plus $49 up front), while the NuraLoop run $8 a month (plus $29).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch CEO and founder Atif Siddiqi declined to reveal at which valuation the company’s current round was raised but did note that it saw 300% revenue growth year over year in 2020, and a 700% increase in the number of enterprises using its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch was founded to give companies a more cost-effective, faster way to pay employees and contractors, which in turn theoretically can maybe help them attract and retain talent and save money compared to using traditional payment methods. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Siddiqi first started the company, Branch was focused on a use case of helping workers pick up additional hours at companies they already worked at to grow their income. But then the team started looking for other ways to help these workers financially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our strengths was that we were connected to a lot of very disparate enterprise systems. And we were collecting a lot of really interesting employment data,” Siddiqi told TechCrunch. “With that data, we realized we could really build a better financial service experience for this consumer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch typically focuses on low to moderate income users, and sits between the company and its worker payment flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started off with earned wage access and then began accelerating payments for workers. It has since expanded into use cases such as digital tip payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things we saw when we were working with a lot of Domino&#8217;s franchisees is that a lot of them didn’t have enough cash at the end of the day to tip out their drivers,” Siddiqi explains. Rather than be forced to go to an ATM to get cash, some turned to Branch’s Wallet offering, which gives franchise owners the ability to push tip payments in real time after a driver finishes a shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tips represent about 40% of a driver’s income on a monthly basis so that’s pretty significant,” Siddiqi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch then expanded into contractor payments, such as helping companies pay their 1099 contractors faster with a “uniform” payment experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we could rebuild a better financial service experience from the ground up, and that&#8217;s where you find Branch today,” Siddiqi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siddiqi said the company tries to provide as many free options as possible, such as not charging for instant transfers into the Branch Wallet and non-instant transfers to another financial account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other fintechs, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monetizes primarily off of interchange fees. It also charges a transaction fee for pushing funds instantly from the Branch Wallet to another financial account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Faster payments is a compelling and transformative benefit expected by today’s workforce,” Siddiqi said. “We’ve seen how it can significantly improve cash flow for both companies and workers, so we’re excited to deliver instant payments and other engaging tools to more sectors and workforces, from other workers living paycheck to paycheck to independent contractors growing their own businesses.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the company’s efforts to grow beyond the multibillion-dollar earned wage access market, it has expanded into contractor and influencer payments with a new deal with influencer marketing platform Tagger and other on-demand delivery platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch also recently inked an agreement with Kelly, a global staffing firm. Other customers include Delivery Drivers, Inc. (DDI), an independent contractor management solution specializing in last-mile delivery, and HR and IT management platform Rippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is similar to another fintech, <a href="https://gigwage.com/">GigWage</a>, but the biggest difference &#8212; according to Siddiqi &#8212; is that Branch has built its own payment rails and system to push out funds instantly, and also has offerings for W-2 workforces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive Capital partner Andy Jenks believes that the company’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financial services address pay cycle gaps and cash flow challenges in a way “that can save time and costs for both workers and the companies they work for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen how impactful Branch’s acceleration of payments for employers and the W-2 workforce has been,” he wrote via email, “and look forward to their expansion into contractor payments where they can serve a range of rapidly growing industries such as last-mile delivery, logistics and influencers.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company that develops thrusters and de-orbiting modules for small satellites, will be sending its technology to space for the first time. The company has signed on with Rocket Lab to send its inaugural AuroraSat-1 CubeSat into low Earth orbit aboard an Electron rocket rideshare mission in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Aurora is part of a small number of startups that have emerged over the past few years whose technology could help solve a tricky problem that, for most of us, can be summed up as &#8220;out of sight, out of mind&#8221;: space junk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Removing space debris requires action and caution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/embed/#?secret=1MAfrVw3DJ" data-secret="1MAfrVw3DJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Space junk, or orbital debris, includes any human-generated object in space that’s no longer functional. While the Department of Defense keeps track of around 27,000 pieces of space junk through its Space Surveillance Network, there are estimated to be millions of pieces of debris floating around in low Earth orbit. As the costs of launch and other technology continues to decline, LEO is only poised to grow more crowded in the coming years &#8212; which could mean more useless junk floating around us in the long-term.</p>
<p>The launch with Rocket Lab later this year is the opportunity for the company to demonstrate its technology in-space. AuroraSat-1 will have two modules. The first module will contain six “resistojet” thrusters, designed to help CubeSats quickly de-tumble and adjust their attitude control, or the satellite’s orientation. Aurora will also test its Plasma Brakes, which use an electrically charged microtether to generate drag for satellite de-orbiting.</p>
<p>AuroraSat-1 was originally scheduled to fly with in-space transportation provider Momentus on board a Space X Falcon 9 rideshare mission earlier this year, but that flight was halted after Momentus failed to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Regarding the switch-up, Aurora CEO Roope Takala told TechCrunch that “in light of Momentus’ difficulties, we had to re-manifest the satellite onto the now published Rocket Lab flight.” Aurora announced in March it had signed on to launch a satellite with Momentus in June 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A California-based medical startup that provides COVID-19 testing across Los Angeles has pulled down a website it used to allow customers to access their test results after a customer found a vulnerability that allowed access to other people&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>Total Testing Solutions has 10 COVID-19 testing sites across Los Angeles, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flurotest-diagnostics-systems-and-total-testing-solutions-sign-pilot-program-mou-to-bring-first-high-volume-sars-cov-2-testing-system-to-california-301281753.html">processes &#8220;thousands&#8221;</a> of COVID-19 tests at workplaces, sports venues and schools each week. When test results are ready, customers get an email with a link to a website to get their results.</p>
<p>But one customer said they found a website vulnerability that allowed them to access other customers&#8217; information by increasing or decreasing a number in the website&#8217;s address by a single digit. That allowed the customer to see other customers&#8217; names and the date of their test. The website also only requires a person&#8217;s date of birth to access their COVID-19 test results, which the customer who discovered the vulnerability said &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take long&#8221; to brute-force, or simply guess. (That&#8217;s just 11,000 birthday guesses for anyone under age 30.)</p>

	</p>
<p>Although the test results website is protected by a login page that prompts the customer for their email address and password, the vulnerable part of the website that allowed the customer to change the web address and access other customers&#8217; information could be accessed directly from the web, bypassing the sign-in prompt altogether.</p>
<p>The customer passed on details of the vulnerability to TechCrunch to get the vulnerability fixed before someone else finds it or exploits it, if not already.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified the customer&#8217;s findings, but while we did not enumerate each result code, through limited testing found that the vulnerability likely put around 60,000 tests at risk. TechCrunch reported the vulnerability to TTS chief medical officer Geoffrey Trenkle, who did not dispute the number of discovered tests, but said the vulnerability was limited to an on-premise server used to provide legacy test results that has since been shut down and replaced by a new cloud-based system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were recently made aware of a potential security vulnerability in our former on-premises server that could allow access to certain patient names and results using a combination of URL manipulation and date of birth programming codes,&#8221; said Trenkle in a statement. &#8220;The vulnerability was limited to patient information obtained at public testing sites before the creation of the cloud-based server. In response to this potential threat, we immediately shut down the on-premises software and began migrating that data to the secure cloud-based system to prevent future risk of data breach. We also initiated a vulnerability assessment, including the review of server access logs to detect any unrecognized network activity or unusual authentication failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trenkle declined to say when the cloud server became active, and why the allegedly legacy server had test results as recently as last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, TTS is not aware of any breach of unsecured protected health information as a result of the issues with its prior server. To our knowledge, no patient health information was actually compromised, and all risk has been mitigated going forward,&#8221; said Trenkle.</p>
<p>Trenkle said the company will comply with its legal obligations under state law, but stopped short of explicitly saying if the company plans to notify customers of the vulnerability. Although companies aren&#8217;t obliged to report vulnerabilities to their state&#8217;s attorney general or to their customers, many do out of an abundance of caution since it&#8217;s not always possible to determine if there was improper access.</p>
<p>TTS chief executive Lauren Trenkle, who was copied on an email chain, did not comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many companies shift to a hybrid approach to work, where some folks are working in the office and some at home, it&#8217;s easy for the home-based workers to feel a disconnect, even with video conferencing tools like Zoom. Video Window is designed to give users a feeling of being connected to other offices as though you were looking through a virtual window. Today, the company introduced a companion app for iOS and Android called <a href="https://videowindow.com/#remote">Video Window Remote</a> aimed squarely at those remote employees.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the latest addition to the Video Window family is designed to involve not just intra-office remote communication, but also to include those employees who are working offsite, whether at home or in another location, and make them feel like they are in the office.</p>
<p>While video conferencing allows you to meet virtually to discuss the business of your work, it doesn&#8217;t give that connection that you feel of being in the office and chatting with your colleagues. That can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or that your ideas are not being heard.</p>
<p>With Video Window Remote, users download the app to their phone or tablet and use that as a visual connection to the office, getting both video and audio as desired. This provides the water cooler experience that many remote workers feel they are missing by not being in the office.</p>

<p>Company CEO Daryl Hutchings says he came up with many of the features in Video Window Remote based on his own experience working at home during the pandemic. &#8220;Using Video Window is exactly like looking through a window to see your colleagues. It enables you to really be present with the people you work with while successfully completing your projects and accomplishing your goals, making work better, more enjoyable, fun and leveling the playing field for all. Ultimately creating a happy hybrid workplace,&#8221; Hutchings said in a statement.</p>
<p>In case you are concerned about security or privacy with a tool like this, Hutchings says that he built in several safeguards, including preventing guest access, audio and video off by default (you control when you want to be seen and heard), the ability for everyone to see who is present regardless of their video/audio status and scheduled sleep mode, so the service only turns on during scheduled hours.</p>
<p>The tool is available for free starting today from the iOS and Android app stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics, a digital therapeutics startup, has received an FDA breakthrough device designation for their 12-week smartphone-assisted fibromyalgia management program. This is the company’s first breakthrough designation, and precedes a deluge of clinical trials scheduled for this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics was founded in 2019 and has raised a total of $9 million in seed funding led by JAZZ Venture Partners. The company is focused on managing chronic pain, and specifically fibromyalgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA breakthrough designation was awarded to the company’s smartphone adaptation of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program originally designed and tested at the University of Manitoba. Swing Therapeutics has exclusively licensed the program, and adapted it to form their own phone-based version. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically used [The University of Manitoba program] as a basis for our program and then really built on top of it, and adapted it to a sort of experience that would work great for a modern-day smartphone interface,” says Mike Rosenbluth, the founder and CEO of Swing Therapeutics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA designation will allow Swing Therapeutics expedited review at the FDA as the company conducts a series of clinical trials on the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there is no cure for fibromyalgia, but the FDA has approved three drugs that can help manage symptoms. Those include: Lyrica, which is usually prescribed to treat nerve damage, but is also used to treat fibromyalgia; Cymbalta, which was originally developed to treat depression, anxiety and diabetic neuropathy; and Savella, an SSRI that’s similar to treatments for depression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the drug world, there’s some evidence ACT can help patients who live with chronic pain (including fibromyalgia). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neuroglee gets $2.3 million to develop digital therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/neuroglee-gets-2-3-million-to-develop-digital-therapeutics-for-neurodegenerative-diseases/embed/#?secret=272smn94vL" data-secret="272smn94vL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26818413/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 25 studies on ACT and chronic pain, for instance, found that ACT therapy had small effects on pain intensity. But the therapeutic process of teaching patients to accept their pain (but not ignore it) was linked with moderate and long-term improvements in depression, anxiety and quality of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What ACT does is it tries to help people accept those symptoms and things that are uncontrollable. It helps people think about their values &#8212; what is really important to them,” says Rosenbluth. “And then they try to make behavior-based changes aligned with those values.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that vein, Swing Therapeutics’ platform is designed to be prescribed by a doctor as a treatment management tool. Once prescribed, the patient would enter a 41-session acceptance and commitment therapy program that’s run entirely on their phone, and broken into “daily doses.” A &#8220;daily dose&#8221; might include a prompt for a mindfulness session or a short writing prompt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Manitoba program that Swing’s smartphone program is based on</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29481976/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a randomized controlled trial to its name. It was initially validated in a study on 67 participants who either received treatment as usual or their regular treatment plus ACT delivered via an eight-week online course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing the course was linked with improvements in depression symptoms and improvements in patients’ scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R), which measures the effects of fibromyalgia on sleep, pain perception, fatigue or psychological distress. The course appeared to help patients improve their “pain acceptance” and through that mechanism the experience of fibromyalgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, the Swing Therapeutics program does differ slightly from the University of Manitoba program &#8212; namely, it’s designed for almost daily use, over 12 weeks on a smartphone, as opposed to eight weeks on a computer. Even these small changes warrant their own independent clinical trials to ensure this approach also helps fibromyalgia patients benefit from this specific ACT therapy program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics has several of these clinical trials at different stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, Swing completed enrollment of a 67-person pilot study on their adapted treatment for fibromyalgia (patients were assigned to an active control or the ACT digital therapy). This study is ongoing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Swing also launched a large-scale study called <a href="https://react-fm.com/welcome/003">REACT-FM</a>. This study, currently recruiting, aims to enroll about 100 to 150 patients who will use the ACT product for two weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the company is also in the development phase for a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial. After completion of that study, the company plans to submit to the FDA for full approval of the platform. That study, says Rosenbluth, is planned to launch at the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA breakthrough therapy designation has already helped shape these studies. As the trials continue, this designation means the device will continue to enjoy expedited review, which could smooth the platform’s journey through clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found it really useful to be able to have that channel dialogue with the FDA, so that we can make sure that we&#8217;re aligned in clinical study design and our approaches are in line with things that the FDA expects,” Rosenbluth says. </span></p>
