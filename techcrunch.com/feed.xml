					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Wednesday, May 26. Yes, we’re going to get to the huge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">Amazon-MGM deal</a>, but we have to chat about a startup first. Have you heard of Poparazzi? If you have kids you might have &#8212; it’s the latest social phenom. And it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">just ran its way up to the top of the App Store</a>. (Too bad it’s not <em>Pup</em>arazzi!)</p>
<p>Yes, I feel old as well. Take a look if you want to know what the kids are up to. Now, the rest of the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon snaps up MGM:</strong> The biggest news out today is <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">the giant Amazon-MGM deal worth more than $8 billion</a></strong>. Its studio purchase helps cement Amazon in the mix of tech companies with huge investments in the online video space. Observers believe the e-commerce giant plans to use MGM to bolster its Prime service, making consumers less likely to churn thanks to the inclusion of more services. Which rings hollow to us: Who is going to give up Prime, but be swayed by movies? The connection to shipping speed feels tenuous.</li>
<li><strong>The global fintech boom:</strong> This morning, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/latam-focused-corporate-spend-startup-clara-raises-30m-months-after-its-last-round/">Clara announced a new round</a></strong>, mere months after it raised <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">its preceding round of capital</a></strong>. The Mexican startup works in the corporate spend market, a startup niche that recently saw a $2.5 billion exit in the United States, and more capital for<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"> both Ramp</a></strong> and Brex. Our read here is that many nascent fintech formulas that work in the U.S. are going to have wide remit globally.</li>
<li><strong>IPOs are back:</strong> The recent Flywire IPO pricing (strong) and first-day trading (even stronger) are indicative that <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/flywires-flotation-suggests-the-ipo-slowdown-is-behind-us/">the temporarily slowed public-offering market is <em>back</em></a></strong>. So, Robinhood, let’s go?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Here are five of the tastiest venture capital rounds that TechCrunch covered, showing off an array of niches and round sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/uks-paysend-raises-125m-at-a-700m-valuation-to-expand-its-all-in-one-payments-platform/"><strong>UK’s Paysend raises $125M for mobile B2B payments</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You are excused for wondering if every fintech round these days involves both companies and payments. I feel the same way. But what matters in the case of Paysend is that its model to provide SMB online payment services is happening from a post-Brexit U.K. Not even a tectonic decoupling can stop U.K. fintech, it seems.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/yalo-raises-50m-to-build-c-commerce-services-for-chat-apps-like-whatsapp/"><strong>Yalo raises $50M for conversational commerce</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Here’s a tech startup round that typifies the year. Did it raise less than a year ago? Yes. Did the company have funding find it, as opposed to the other way around? Yes. And did COVID accelerate its business? Yes. Yalo is a wager that the way we buy online is changing, a technology story if we’ve ever heard of one. And it’s one that venture capitalists are lining up to bet on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed/"><strong>Skiff raises $3.7M for encrypted Google Docs</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s the pitch, per our own Zack Whittaker. Essentially, Skiff mimics the familiar features of Google Docs, but with end-to-end encryption. As a fan of privacy, I dig the project.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/treet-with-2-8-million-in-seed-funding-gets-brands-involved-in-the-resale-market/"><strong>Treet raises $2.8M to help brands resell their own stuff</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The online resale market is huge. ThreadUp is public now, as is Poshmark. But Treet is betting that there is still room in the market for more tech, namely its plan to get brands involved in their own resale market. It isn’t the richest startup around, but given the sheer number of brands out there, it has a pretty huge TAM to grow into.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">African fintech OPay is in the process of raising a huge new round</a>. The investment could help push the continent’s 2021 venture capital totals to new heights, based on data TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">reported earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<h2>7 questions to ask before relocating your startup to Florida</h2>
<p>Cities like Miami, Pittsburgh and Austin have been drawing talent and wealth from Silicon Valley for years, but the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend.</p>
<p>In recent months, many investors and entrepreneurs have noisily departed for Miami, citing the region&#8217;s favorable business climate and quality of life. It&#8217;s always good to consider one&#8217;s options, but before booking a moving van for the Sunshine State — or any emerging tech hub, for that matter — here are some basic questions entrepreneurs should ask themselves.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We’re not going to touch on the Amazon-MGM deal more here in the Big Tech section, leaving us room for all sorts of other news:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> is looking into allowing users of both the Big Blue App and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">to hide social like counts</a>. Which is great for your mental health, we suspect, if awful for those of us with overdeveloped competitive urges.</li>
<li><strong>Visa</strong> is rebounding from its pre-nuptial breakup with fintech unicorn Plaid by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/visa-takes-a-swipe-in-fintech-builds-new-online-marketplace/">building a vetted list of fintech startups</a> that its friends and other customers may want to leverage. In a sense, it’s a way for startups to get a stamp of approval from Visa, and possibly more clients in the process. What’s in it for Visa? More digital payments. That’s good for a company that does lots of payments work, we reckon.</li>
<li><strong>GM</strong> and <strong>Lockheed</strong> are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/general-motors-lockheed-martin-to-develop-new-lunar-rover-for-nasa-artemis-missions-to-the-moon/">working on the next American lunar vehicle</a>. It is very, very American to have the progenitors of the consumer Hummer and various weapons of death build our next extraplanetary go-kart. And it’s good that we may go back to the moon? It’s more than time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To round out the Big Tech section today, <strong>OpenAI</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/openais-100m-startup-fund-will-make-big-early-bets-with-microsoft-as-partner/">out in the market with a $100 million fund</a> to invest in startups. And Microsoft is partnering with the company and putting funds into the capital pool. It feels like ages ago that Microsoft told me that it wasn’t getting into the VC game because the returns would not prove material to its asset base. That wasn’t the point and the company seems to have figured that out.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports that OpenAI’s Sam Altman of Y Combinator fame said that the fund “plan[s] to make big early bets on a relatively small number of companies, probably not more than 10.” Something to watch out for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Would you pay for an upgraded Twitter? That&#8217;s a question Twitter will soon answer when it rolls out a new subscription service that will present users with an expanded feature set available only to paid subscribers. This is a different offering than Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">previously announced Super Follow subscription</a> plans, which will allow users to subscribe to individual creators for access to exclusive content. Instead, the new subscription service will target Twitter&#8217;s power users who tweet frequently enough or otherwise engage with the product to the point that they&#8217;d be willing to pay to do even more.</p>
<p>Twitter has already broadly hinted at its forthcoming subscription plans, having told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg in February</a> that it would &#8220;research and experiment&#8221; with ways to diversify its revenue beyond advertising in 2021 and beyond. Twitter ads are 85% of revenue, but Twitter often faces <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/twitter-beats-revenue-estimates-warns-of-slowing-user-growth">slowing</a> or <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">flat</a> user growth. That has led the company to consider new ways to extract more money from existing users. It told Bloomberg this plan &#8220;may include subscriptions&#8221; and other approaches that gave businesses and users access to &#8220;unique features.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also reiterated its interest in subscription products<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf"> during its Twitter Analyst Day</a> later that same month, when it said it would &#8220;experiment with subscriptions.&#8221; And its Twitter Investor Relations account <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1366821636712722432">tweeted in March</a> that it would &#8220;test subscription products in public.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But so far, the only subscription product Twitter has fully detailed is Super Follow, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">also announced during its Analyst Day event.</a> It had not specifically spelled out what its other subscription tests would look like, nor provided any sense as to when they would arrive beyond tests that would begin rolling out <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1366821636712722432">&#8220;over the course of this year</a>.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qz3OftytSG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/embed/#?secret=qz3OftytSG" data-secret="qz3OftytSG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What we know of Twitter&#8217;s efforts on this particular front doesn&#8217;t come from official sources.</p>
<p>Instead, it comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">app researcher Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who earlier this month scooped not only Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription offering itself but also its name and pricing. She found the forthcoming subscription plan, currently dubbed &#8220;Twitter Blue,&#8221; would cost $2.99 per month and would include access to new features like bookmark collections and the Undo Tweets feature that Twitter had previously <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-might-let-you-undo-tweets-if-you-pay-a-subscription-fee/">confirmed to CNET</a> were being tested.</p>
<p>However, when tech news site <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets">The Verge</a> asked Twitter to comment on Twitter Blue, the company declined.</p>
<p><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_news/2021/05/JPM-TMC-Conference-2021-Date-Announcement.pdf">This week at</a> J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Twitter spelled things out a bit more clearly.</p>
<p>Instead of vaguely hinting at forthcoming &#8220;experiments&#8221; or tests that gave &#8220;people and businesses of all sizes access to unique features,&#8221; <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf">as it said before</a> (gotta love that corporate speak!), Twitter CFO Ned Segal told investors its new &#8220;premium service&#8221; would be aimed at people who use Twitter&#8217;s service &#8212; &#8220;and they pay us for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Segal noted this premium offering was one of the two types of subscriptions that Twitter had in the works, the other being Super Follows.</p>
<p>The premium service also sounded less of an &#8220;experiment&#8221; than when Twitter had discussed its plans before. In earlier statements, it had seemed as if Twitter was embarking on some kind of research project to see if there was even any demand for a Twitter premium subscription at all. The wording the company used in the past didn&#8217;t make it clear how seriously this effort was.</p>
<p>Segal said the company would offer more info about Twitter&#8217;s premium service in the coming months. It would test the service to learn more, but then it would &#8220;ultimately roll it out to people around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no &#8220;experiment&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s a roadmap.</p>
<p>Twitter won&#8217;t replace the core, free product it offers, in case you were concerned. He cleared that up, too. It will provide premium features &#8220;on top of [Twitter&#8217;s] continuous improvement mindset around the free version of the service that everybody will continue to have access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter shouldn&#8217;t have to tweak the new offering too much, as it&#8217;s already done a lot of pre-launch research on what features users are most interested in, including via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/">user base surveys back in 2020.</a> Not surprisingly, the Undo Tweet option &#8212; as close as we&#8217;ll ever get to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/twitter-edit-button-jack-dorsey-a9286191.html">an &#8220;edit&#8221; button</a>, was among those features users wanted most.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7j9CsqpV5v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=7j9CsqpV5v" data-secret="7j9CsqpV5v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Twitter didn&#8217;t really say anything we didn&#8217;t know already, thanks to assumptions, leaks and vague confirmations in the past, it&#8217;s nice to see it spelled out in a more straightforward manner as a forthcoming product meant for users worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that we have a durable business for our benefit, but also for the benefit of people who use the service,&#8221; Segal said.</p>
<p>The question now remains whether Twitter&#8217;s users will actually subscribe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drug discovery is a large and growing field, encompassing both ambitious startups and billion-dollar Big Pharma incumbents. <a href="https://www.enginebio.com/">Engine Biosciences</a> is one of the former, a Singaporean outfit with an expert founding crew and a different approach to the business of finding new therapeutics, and it just raised $43 million to keep growing.</p>
<p>Digital drug discovery in general means large-scale analysis of biological data like genes, gene expression, protein structures, binding sites, things like that. Where it has hit a wall in the past is not on the digital side, where any number of likely molecules or processes can be generated, but on the next step, when those notions need to be tested in vitro. So a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/daphne-koller-digital-biology-is-an-incredible-place-to-be-right-now/">new crop of biotech companies</a> have worked to integrate these aspects.</p>
<p>Engine does so with a pair of tools it has dubbed NetMAPPR and CombiGEM. NetMAPPR is a huge sort of search engine for genes and gene interactions, taking special note of &#8220;errors&#8221; that could provide a foothold for a molecule or treatment. CombiGEM is like a mass genetic testing process that can look into thousands of gene combinations and edits on diseased cells simultaneously, providing quick experimental confirmation of the targets and effects proposed by the digital side. The company is focused on anti-cancer drugs but is looking into other fields as they become viable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The focus on gene interactions sets their approach apart, said co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Lu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gene interactions are relevant to all diseases, and in cancers, where we focus, a proven approach for effective precision medicines,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;For example, there are four approved drugs targeting the PARP enzyme in the context of mutation in the BRCA gene that is changing cancer treatment for millions of people. The fundamental principle of this precision medicine is based on understanding the gene interaction between BRCA and PARP.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/engine-biosciences-raises-10-million-in-southeast-asias-largest-institutional-seed-round/"> raised a $10 million seed in 2018</a> and has been doing its thing ever since — but it needs more money if it&#8217;s going to bring some of these things to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have chemical compounds directed toward the novel biology we have uncovered,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;These are effectively prototype drugs, which are showing anti-cancer effects in diseased cells. We need to refine and optimize these prototypes to a suitable candidate to enter the clinic for testing in humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now they&#8217;re working with other companies to do the next step up from automated testing, which is to say animal testing, to clear the way for human trials.</p>
<p>The CombiGEM experiments — hundreds of thousands of them — produce a large amount of data as well, and they&#8217;re sharing and collaborating on that front with several medical centers throughout Asia. &#8220;We have built what we believe to be the largest data compendium related to gene interactions in the context of cancer disease relevance,&#8221; said Lu, adding that this is crucial to the success of the machine learning algorithms they employ to predict biological processes.</p>
<p>The $43 million round was led by Polaris Partners, with participation by newcomers Invus and a long list of existing investors. The money will go toward the requisite testing and paperwork involved in bringing a new drug to market based on promising leads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have small molecule compounds for our lead cancer programs with data from in vitro (in cancer cells) experiments. We are refining the chemistry and expanding studies this year,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;Next year, we anticipate having our first drug candidate enter the late preclinical phase of development and regulatory work for an IND (investigational new drug) filing with the FDA, and starting the clinical trials in 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long road to human trials, let alone widespread use, but that&#8217;s the risk any drug discovery startup takes. The carrot dangling in front of them is not just the possibility of a product that could generate billions in income, but perhaps save the lives of countless cancer patients awaiting novel therapies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has installed its 200,000th Powerwall, the company&#8217;s home battery storage product, the company said <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1397651493755498499">in a tweet</a> on Wednesday. Tesla&#8217;s CFO Zachary Kirkhorn told investors during a first-quarter earnings call in April that Tesla is continuing to work through a &#8220;multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall,&#8221; suggesting that the volume of installations will continue to soar in coming months.</p>
<p>During that earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">said the company will no longer sell</a> its Solar Roof panel product without a Powerwall. He said widespread installation of solar panels plus home battery packs (Tesla built, of course) would turn every home into a distributed power plant.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Every solar Powerwall installation that the house or apartment or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so even if all the lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. So that gives people energy security. And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wBnWbYFDDk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">Tesla wants to make every home a distributed power plant</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He noted the unprecedented winter storm in Texas in February, which, combined with record-breaking demand for electricity, left millions without power in freezing temperatures. He suggested that under that scenario, utilities could work with customers who have Powerwalls to release stored electricity back on the grid to meet that demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if the grid needs more power, we can actually then with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and the partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power on to the grid to take care of peak power demand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tesla hit the 100,000 milestone for Powerwall installations in April 2020, five years after it debuted the first-generation Powerwall. That means that sales numbers that took the company five years to achieve were doubled in a single year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The deck has to show that you're solving an important problem, that you've got the path to an important solution, that there is a big market opportunity, and that your team is positioned to execute."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In just a few short years, Vise has gone from launching on the Disrupt Battlefield stage to unicorn. Co-founders Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra met Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire at an afterparty at the event, and Maguire ended up leading a seed and Series A round while Sequoia led the Series B. Last week, Vise raised its Series C of $65 million and was officially valued at $1 billion post-money.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We sat down with Vasavada and Maguire to talk about the early fundraising process for Vise, specifically the seed round, and get a look at the startup&#8217;s first pitch deck. We discussed what Vasavada has learned about delivering a good fundraising pitch, and what stood out about the pitch and the product for Maguire.</p>
<h2>Simplicity is key</h2>
<p>Vasavada says he&#8217;s made dozens of pitch decks since starting Vise and that this early deck was not his best because it was trying to do too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide,&#8221; said Vasavada, adding that many founders think they need to show investors every part of their business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deck has to show that you&#8217;re solving an important problem, that you&#8217;ve got the path to an important solution, that there is a big market opportunity, and that your team is positioned to execute,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are the only four things that matter. Everything else can be discussed in the Q&amp;A.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal of a pitch meeting is not to get the &#8220;yes&#8221; instantly, and satisfy every curiosity, but rather to give the investor something to think about and a reason to want another conversation.</p>
<p>Vasavada explained to the audience that this early seed deck certainly went into too much detail and was too text-heavy. (You can check out the full deck below.)</p>
<h2>Why will this product be successful right now?</h2>
<p>Beyond the problem, solution, market and team, there is an additional X factor that makes a difference in pitching for fundraising.</p>
<p>Timing can make or break a startup. Incredible ideas, ones that have gone on to be some of the biggest businesses in the world, have fizzled out and died for being too early.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Instagram&#8217;s photo tagging feature was spun out into its own app, you&#8217;d have the viral sensation <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">Poparazzi</a>, now the No. 1 app on the App Store. The new social networking app, from the same folks behind <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ttyl-inc">TTYL</a> and others, lets you create a social profile that only your friends can post photos to &#8212; in other words, making your friends your own &#8220;paparazzi.&#8221; To its credit, the new app has perfectly executed on a series of choices designed to fuel day-one growth &#8212; from its prelaunch TikTok hype cycle to drive App Store preorders to its postlaunch social buzz, including favorable tweets by its backers. But the app has also traded user privacy in some cases to amplify network effects in its bid for the Top Charts, which is a risky move in terms of its long-term staying power.</p>
<p>The company positions Poparazzi as a sort of anti-Instagram, rebelling against today&#8217;s social feeds filled with edited photos, too many selfies and &#8220;seemingly effortless perfection.&#8221; People&#8217;s real lives are made up of many unperfect moments that are worthy of being captured and shared, too, <a href="https://medium.com/poparazzi/the-anti-selfie-selfie-club-ad1ce447ac91">a company blog post explains</a>.</p>
<p>This manifesto hits the right notes at the right time. User demand for less performative social media has been steadily growing for years &#8212; particularly as younger, Gen Z users wake up to the manipulations by tech giants. We&#8217;ve already seen a number of startups try to siphon users away from Instagram using similar rallying cries, including<a href="https://www.minutiae-app.org/"> Minutiae</a>,<a href="https://vero.co/"> Vero</a>,<a href="https://www.dayflashapp.com/"> Dayflash</a>,<a href="http://hipstamatic.com/oggl/"> Oggl</a> and, more recently, the once-buzzy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">Dispo</a> and the under-the-radar <a href="https://www.theherdapp.com/">Herd</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even Facebook has woken up to consumer demand on this front, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">plan to roll out new features</a> that allow Facebook and Instagram users to remove the Like counts from their posts and their feeds.</p>
<p>Poparazzi hasn&#8217;t necessarily innovated in terms of its core idea &#8212; after all, tagging users in photos has existed for years. In fact, it was one of the first viral effects <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/22/facebook-photos-pulls-away-from-the-pack/">introduced by Facebook</a> in its earlier days.</p>
<p>Instead, Poparazzi hit the top of the charts by carefully executing on growth strategies that ensured a rocket ship-style launch.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>The company began gathering prelaunch buzz by driving demand <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@poparazziapp?">via TikTok</a> &#8212; a platform that&#8217;s already helped mint App Store hits like the<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/8/22272980/high-heels-tiktok-ios-app-store-free-game"> mobile game High Heels</a>. TikTok&#8217;s powers are still often underestimated, even though its potential to send apps up the Top Charts have successfully boosted downloads for a number of mobile businesses, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/capcut-bytedance-tiktok/">TikTok sister app CapCut</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/">e-commerce app Shein</a>, for example.</p>
<p>And Poparazzi didn&#8217;t just build demand on TikTok &#8212; it actually captured it by pointing users to its App Store preorders page via the link in its bio. By the time launch day rolled around, it had<a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035371884539906"> a gaggle of Gen Z users</a> ready and willing to give Poparazzi a try.</p>

<p>The app launches with a clever onboarding screen that uses haptics to buzz and vibrate your phone while the intro video plays. This is unusual enough that users will talk and post about how cool it was &#8212; another potential means of generating organic growth through word-of-mouth.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After getting you riled up with excitement, Poparazzi eases you into its bigger data grab.</p>
<p>First, it signs up and authenticates users through a phone number. Despite Apple’s App Store policy, which requires it, there is no privacy-focused option to use &#8220;Sign In with Apple,&#8221; which allows users to protect their identity. That would have limited Poparazzi’s growth potential versus its phone number and address book access approach.</p>
<p>It then presents you with a screen where it asks for permission to access your Camera (an obvious necessity) and Contacts (wait, all of them?), and permission to send you Notifications. This is where things start to get more dicey. The app, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332182/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update">Clubhouse once did</a>, demands a full address book upload. This is unnecessary in terms of an app&#8217;s usability, as there are plenty of other ways to add friends on social media &#8212; like by scanning each other&#8217;s QR code, typing in a username directly or performing a search.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>But gaining access to someone&#8217;s full Contacts database lets Poparazzi skip having to build out features for the privacy-minded. It can simply match your stored phone numbers with those it has on file from user signups and create an instant friend graph.</p>
<p>As you complete each permission, Poparazzi rewards you with green checkmarks. In fact, even if you deny the permission being asked, the green check appears. This may confuse users as to whether they&#8217;ve accidently given the app access.</p>

<p>While you can &#8220;deny&#8221; the Address Book upload &#8212; a request met with a <em>tsk tsk</em> of a pop-up message &#8212; <em>Poparazzi literally only works with friends,</em> it warns you &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">you can&#8217;t avoid being found by other Poparazzi users who have your phone number stored in their phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When users sign up, the app matches their address book to the phone number it has on file and then &#8212; boom! &#8212; new users are instantly following the existing users. And if any other friends have signed up before you, they&#8217;ll be following you as soon as you log in the first time.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In other words, there&#8217;s no manual curation of a &#8220;friend graph&#8221; here. The expectation is that your address book <em>is</em> your friend graph, and Poparazzi is just duplicating it.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t always an accurate presentation of reality.</p>
<p>Many younger people, and particularly women, have the phone numbers of abusers, stalkers and exes stored in their phone&#8217;s Contacts. By doing so, they can leverage the phone&#8217;s built-in tools to block the unwanted calls and texts from that person. But because Poparazzi automatically matches people by phone number, abusers could gain immediate access to the user profiles of the people they’re trying to harass or hurt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Sure, this is an edge case. But it&#8217;s a nontrivial one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a well-documented problem, too &#8212; and <a href="https://www.crazyintherain.com/intruder-alert-the-clubhouse-app-is-a-stalkers-dream-and-your-worst-nightmare/">one that had plagued</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubhouseApp/comments/kz7s8r/my_cyber_stalker_has_followed_me_on_clubhouse/">Clubhouse</a>, which similarly required full address book uploads during its early growth phase. It’s a terrible strategy to become the norm, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse-buzz-is-already-fading-but-andreessen-horowitz-isnt-put-off.html">and one that</a> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90632460/as-clubhouse-downloads-plummet-clones-hope-they-can-convince-users-that-audio-is-the-future">does not appear</a> to have created a lasting near-term lock-in for Clubhouse. It&#8217;s also not a new tactic. Mobile social network Path tried address book uploads nearly a decade ago and almost everyone at the time agreed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/path-uploads-your-iphones-address-book-to-their-servers-without-a-peep/">this was not a good idea.</a></p>
<p>As carefully designed as Poparazzi is &#8212; (it&#8217;s even got a blue icon &#8212;<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/175428#:~:text=Blue%3A%20Cool%20blue%20is%20perceived,message%20of%20stability%20inspires%20trust."> a color that denotes trustworthiness</a>!) &#8212; it&#8217;s likely the company intentionally chose the trade-off. It&#8217;s forgoing some aspects of user privacy and safety in favor of the network effects that come from having an instant friend graph.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Chase Stubblefield <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f6f4.png" alt="🛴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@chasestubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/chasestubb/status/1397106165780078592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The rest of the app then pushes you to grow that friend graph further and engage with other users. Your profile will remain bare unless you can convince someone to upload photos of you. A SnapKit integration lets you beg for photo tags over on Snapchat. And if you can&#8217;t get enough of your friends to tag you in photos, then you may find yourself drawn to the setting &#8220;Allow Pops from Everyone,&#8221; instead of just &#8220;People You Approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no world in which letting &#8220;everyone&#8221; upload photos to a social media profile doesn&#8217;t invite abuse at some point, but Poparazzi is clearly hedging its bets here. It likely knows it won&#8217;t have to deal with the fallout of these choices until further down the road &#8212; after it&#8217;s filled out its network with millions of disgruntled Instagram users, that is.</p>
<p>Dozens of other growth hacks are spread throughout the app, too, from <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035390419181568">multiple pushes to invite friends</a> scattered throughout the app to a very Snapchatt-y <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035422899834880?s=20">&#8220;Top Poparazzi&#8221; section</a> that will incentivize best friends to keep up their posting streaks.</p>

<p>The “Top Poparazzi” section is genius. Really incentivizes posting for your friends (which is the biggest friction point). <a href="https://t.co/7WjH0S2hQd">pic.twitter.com/7WjH0S2hQd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Connor V. (@ConnorVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorVO/status/1397035422899834880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a clever bag of tricks. And though the app does not offer comments or followers counts, it isn&#8217;t being much of an &#8220;anti-Instagram&#8221; when it comes to chasing clout. The posts &#8212; which can turn into looping GIFs if you snap a few in a row &#8212; may be more &#8220;authentic&#8221; and unedited than those on Instagram; but Poparazzi users react to posts with a range of emojis and how many reactions a post receives is shown publicly.</p>
<p>For beta testers featured on the explore page, reactions can be in the hundreds or thousands &#8212; effectively establishing a bar for Pop influence.</p>
<p>Finally, users you follow have permission to post photos, but if you <em>unfollow</em> them &#8212; a sure sign that you no longer want them to be in your poparazzi squad &#8212; they can still post to your profile. As it turns out, your squad is managed under a separate setting under &#8220;Allow Pops From.&#8221; That could lead to trouble. At the very least, it would be nice to see the app asking users if they also want to remove the unfollowed account&#8217;s permission to post to your profile at the time of the unfollow.</p>
<p>Overall, the app can be fun &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re in the young, carefree demographic it caters to. Its friend-centric and ironically anti-glam stance is promising as well. But additional privacy controls and the ability to join the service in a way that offers far more granular control of your friend graph in order to boost anti-abuse protections would be welcome additions.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent"> </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch tried to reach Poparazzi&#8217;s team to gain their perspective on the app&#8217;s design and growth strategy, but did not hear back. (We understand they&#8217;re heads down for the time being.) We understand, per SignalFire&#8217;s <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/poparazzi-photo-app-blows-up-by-banning">Josh Constine</a> and our own confirmation, that Floodgate has invested in the startup, as has former TechCrunch co-editor Alexia Bonatsos&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/former-journo-alexia-bonatsos-takes-the-wraps-off-her-new-venture-fund-dream-machine/">Dream Machine</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1396962529968988162?s=20">Weekend Fund</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If it seems like everyone you know is moving to Florida these days, there is evidence to back that up. Recent data from LinkedIn <a href="https://www.axios.com/florida-migration-gains-pandemic-4ade6fc2-1b5f-4a56-b126-ef53cd65b841.html">published in Axios</a> put Tampa Bay, Jacksonville and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro areas among the top 10 U.S. cities seeing in-migration.</p>
<p>When I relocated from Chicago to Tampa in early 2018, I found myself in a city that countered the stereotypes I’d heard about the state. Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the advantages that came with building my organization in Florida, and I’m often asked how I made the call.</p>
<p>To help you weigh the benefits of relocating your startup to Florida, here are some FAQs I’ve encountered. And if the Sunshine State isn’t on your startup’s shortlist, don’t hesitate to apply these answers to a different destination.</p>
<h2>1. What are your company’s needs?</h2>
<p>While you may have personal reasons for wanting to relocate to a new state, it’s a good idea to map out your company’s needs as you think through this decision.</p>
<p>Does a move bring you closer to a great pool of talent? Are you looking for a headquarters near a specific material resource or type of infrastructure? Do you need to be local to a target customer base or community?</p>
<p>For example, Florida is a terrific location for companies that stand to benefit from the presence of retired military talent and the prevalence of military bases, which creates a strong market for certain types of tech innovation, including cybersecurity and aviation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you’re a startup leader who is looking to land in a place with a strong, welcoming network, take the time to reach out to local community leaders and other founders like you.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Whatever it is you need to fuel your company’s growth, listing out your company’s requirements will make it easier to compare your needs with what your potential destination has to offer.</p>
<h2>2. Which community do you want to be a part of?</h2>
<p>If you haven’t found the tech community you’re looking for in your current location, pause to articulate what qualities you’re looking for. With this in mind, you can begin to establish the kinds of local connections you’re hoping to grow before you make any big moves.</p>
<p>I moved to Florida to participate in the diverse tech communities in Tampa and Miami, and I knew I was headed to the right place because I tested the waters before jumping in. As a relative newcomer myself, I’ve found the landscape in Florida to be more open and accessible than in other more established startup hubs, but don’t take my word for it.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup leader who is looking to land in a place with a strong, welcoming network, take the time to reach out to local community leaders and other founders like you. Whether that means sending a tweet to the mayor of Miami or connecting to local startup hubs, these interactions will give you a good sense of the local culture.</p>
<p>Because so many people are migrating down to Florida, we’ve put together a database of recent transplants to make it even easier to connect new residents to the existing tech community.</p>
<h2>3. What are the potential benefits of moving your company to Florida?</h2>
<p>When I think about what brought me to Florida and why I see other entrepreneurs headed this way, three big things come to mind:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenAI is launching a $100 million startup fund, which it calls the <a href="https://openai.com/fund/">OpenAI Startup Fund</a>, through which it and its partners will invest in early-stage AI companies tackling major problems (and productivity). Among those partners and investors in the fund is Microsoft, at whose Build conference OpenAI founder Sam Altman announced the news.</p>
<p>In a prerecorded video, Altman explained that &#8220;this is not a typical corporate venture fund. We plan to make big early bets on a relatively small number of companies, probably not more than 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the $100 million will be divided or disbursed, or on what timeline, or whether this is part of a longer program. But it seems to be a limited fund, not just the 2021 round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altman did say that they will be looking for companies that are taking on serious issues, like healthcare, climate change and education, where AI-powered applications or approaches could &#8220;benefit all of humanity,&#8221; in keeping with OpenAI&#8217;s mission statement. But it would also consider productivity improvements as well, presumably like the GPT-3-powered natural language coding Microsoft showed off yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know it&#8217;s you, the developers, who can use powerful tools like GPT-3 to create ambitious applications that will leave a positive mark on the world,&#8221; said Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott in the company&#8217;s stream. &#8220;Microsoft is thrilled to be able to support this fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies selected for funding will receive early access to new OpenAI systems and Azure resources from Microsoft, which hopefully would allow them to spring fully formed and ready to scale from the program. OpenAI would not elaborate on the equity agreement, expectations for startups, other partners or any further details. It&#8217;s entirely possible that the $100 million figure is the only thing they&#8217;ve actually settled on.</p>
<p>The minimal application process suggests they expect a large number of submissions, but if you want to throw your company into the mix, start prepping your elevator pitch. Part of the application is a one-minute video (take note that &#8220;demos, music and effects are not necessary&#8221;) that the selection team (the makeup of which OpenAI did not detail) will no doubt watch if a company makes it through the first round of winnowing. Hope you haven&#8217;t dismantled that Zoom background just yet.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I do recruitment for tech startups. With a surge of VC investing, many startups are urgently hiring. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Which visas offer the quickest options for international talent? Are there any unique strategies that you would recommend we explore?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Maverick in Milpitas</strong></p>
<p>Dear Maverick,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out with your questions! We’re seeing the same urgent hiring demand from startups. In my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sophie-alcorn/">columns</a>, you’ll find a lot of materials to support you regarding the most common options. However, in a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/072-special-visas-for-talent-from-specific-countries/">podcast episode</a>, I discussed a handful of very specialized — and rarely used — temporary work visas that in most situations offer an expedited way to bring international talent to the United States to live and work. The eligibility requirements for these work visas are very specific, but if any prospective candidates qualify, these visas are great, quick options for the startups you work with.</p>
<p>The quickest option for employers is to hire international talent already in the U.S. because many consulates still remain closed to routine visa processing due to the pandemic. What’s more, travel restrictions have been imposed on India and remain in place for Brazil, the U.K., Ireland, 26 other countries in Europe, China and Iran. However, there are some exceptions in the national interest. As always, I recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney.</p>
<p>Here are a few uncommon visas and strategies that can offer quick options for startups to recruit international talent:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Disrupt has always been opportunity central, but that’s never been truer than this year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23) — especially for early-stage founders who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">exhibit in Startup Alley</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s why. Using Hopin — our virtual platform — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley exhibitors</a> can schedule and host interactive product demos via livestream. Every exhibiting startup receives a company listing — a virtual booth as it were — where you can include a product walk-through video complete with links to your website and social media accounts. But wait, it gets better.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the interactive, livestream capability and share your screen, host a live demo or a product tutorial — you can even moderate the chat area. Put on your entrepreneurial thinking cap and get creative. Why not use the livestream to host your own Q&amp;A session?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before Disrupt even begins, you can combine the power of CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, and your access to the Disrupt attendee list. Schedule a demo to take place during Disrupt, reach out to your targeted audience using CrunchMatch, and line up those RSVPs in advance.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to establish yourself as a subject matter expert — this is a great way to tap into a hot tech topic, invite interested parties and get the conversation rolling. Whether you want to pitch, educate, sell or inspire, Startup Alley is the place and the platform to get the job done.</p>
<p>What else comes with exhibiting in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/"> Startup Alley</a>? We’re so glad you asked.</p>
<p>The founders of every exhibiting startup get two minutes to pitch to TechCrunch staff live in a breakout session — in front of thousands of Disrupt attendees across the globe. It’s not just great practice. You’ll receive invaluable feedback to hone your pitch to prime fundraising perfection.</p>
<p>You might get tapped for a Startup Alley Crawl interview. We’re hosting a one-hour crawl for each business category. TC editors will choose several startups in each category and interview them live on the Disrupt stage.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about the Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Every year, TC editors select two outstanding startups from all the exhibitors. Those Wild Cards get to compete in the epic Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>One last massive opportunity. All early-stages founders who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> before <strong>before Friday, June 4 at 11:59 pm (PDT)</strong> are eligible for Startup Alley+. This is a curated, VIP experience designed to offer more growth opportunities. It kicks off in July and by the time Disrupt rolls around in September, you may well be an unstoppable force. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">Read the details here</a>, and if you want a shot to be one of up to 50 chosen founders, you gotta beat the deadline.</p>
<p>Get creative, take advantage of opportunity central and exhibit in Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. We can’t wait to see what you’ve got!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union plans to beef up its response to online disinformation, with the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2585">saying today</a> it will step up efforts to combat harmful but not illegal content &#8212; including by pushing for smaller digital services and adtech companies to sign up to voluntary rules aimed at tackling the spread of this type of manipulative and often malicious content.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers pointed to risks such as the threat to public health posed by the spread of harmful disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines as driving the need for tougher action.</p>
<p>Concerns about the impacts of online disinformation on democratic processes are another driver, they said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Thierry Breton, commissioner for Internal Market, said: “We need to rein in the infodemic and the diffusion of false information putting people&#8217;s life in danger. Disinformation cannot remain a source of revenue. We need to see stronger commitments by online platforms, the entire advertising ecosystem and networks of fact-checkers. The Digital Services Act will provide us with additional, powerful tools to tackle disinformation.”</p>
<p>A new more expansive code of practice on disinformation is being prepared &#8212; and will, the Commission hopes, be finalized in September, to be ready for application at the start of next year.</p>
<p>Its gear change is a fairly public acceptance that the EU&#8217;s voluntary code of practice &#8212; an approach Brussels has taken since 2018 &#8212; has not worked out as hoped. And, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">we did warn them</a>.</p>
<p>A push to get the adtech industry on board with demonetizing viral disinformation is certainly overdue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear the online disinformation problem hasn&#8217;t gone away. Some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/voter-manipulation-on-social-media-now-a-global-problem-report-finds/">reports</a> have suggested problematic activity &#8212; like social media voter manipulation and computational propaganda &#8212; have been getting worse in recent years, rather than better.</p>
<p>However, getting visibility into the true scale of the disinformation problem remains a huge challenge given that those best placed to know (ad platforms) don&#8217;t freely open their systems to external researchers. But that&#8217;s something else the Commission would like to change.</p>
<p>Signatories to the EU&#8217;s current code of practice on disinformation are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, TikTok, Mozilla, DOT Europe (Former EDiMA), the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and its Belgian counterpart, the Union of Belgian Advertisers (UBA); the European Association of Communications Agencies (EACA), and its national members from France, Poland and the Czech Republic &#8212; respectively, Association des Agences Conseils en Communication (AACC), Stowarzyszenie Komunikacji Marketingowej/Ad Artis Art Foundation (SAR), and Asociace Komunikacnich Agentur (AKA); the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB Europe), Kreativitet &amp; Kommunikation, and Goldbach Audience (Switzerland) AG.</p></blockquote>
<p>EU lawmakers said they want to broaden participation by getting smaller platforms to join, as well as recruiting all the various players in the adtech space whose tools provide the means for monetizing online disinformation.</p>
<p>Commissioners said today that they want to see the code covering a &#8220;whole range&#8221; of actors in the online advertising industry (i.e. rather than the current handful).</p>
<p>In its press release the Commission also said it wants platforms and adtech players to exchange information on disinformation ads that have been refused by one of them &#8212; so there&#8217;s a more coordinated response to shut out bad actors.</p>
<p>As for those who are signed up already, the Commission&#8217;s report card on their performance was bleak.</p>
<p>Speaking during a press conference, Breton said that only one of the five platform signatories to the code has &#8220;really&#8221; lived up to its commitments &#8212; which was presumably a reference to the first five tech giants in the above list (aka: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and TikTok).</p>
<p>Breton demurred on doing an explicit name-and-shame of the four others &#8212; who he said have not &#8220;at all&#8221; done what was expected of them &#8212; saying it&#8217;s not the Commission&#8217;s place to do that.</p>
<p>Rather, he said people should decide among themselves which of the platform giants that signed up to the code have failed to live up to their commitments. (Signatories since 2018 have pledged to take action to disrupt ad revenues of accounts and websites that spread disinformation; to enhance transparency around political and issue-based ads; tackle fake accounts and online bots; to empower consumers to report disinformation and access different news sources while improving the visibility and discoverability of authoritative content; and to empower the research community so outside experts can help monitor online disinformation through privacy-compliant access to platform data.)</p>
<p>Frankly it&#8217;s hard to imagine which of the five tech giants from the above list might actually be meeting the Commission&#8217;s bar. (Microsoft perhaps, on account of its relatively modest social activity versus the rest.)</p>
<p>Safe to say, there&#8217;s been a lot of more hot air (in the form of selective PR) on the charged topic of disinformation versus hard accountability from the major social platforms over the past three years.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s perhaps no accident that Facebook chose today to <a href="https://twitter.com/olgs7/status/1397540905364635655">puff up</a> its historical efforts to combat what it refers to as &#8220;influence operations&#8221; &#8212; aka &#8220;coordinated efforts to manipulate or corrupt public debate for a strategic goal” &#8212; by publishing what it couches as a &#8220;<a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf">threat report</a>&#8221; detailing what it&#8217;s done in this area between 2017 and 2000.</p>
<p>Influence ops refer to online activity that may be being conducted by hostile foreign governments or by malicious agents seeking, in this case, to use Facebook&#8217;s ad tools as a mass manipulation tool &#8212; perhaps to try to skew an election result or influence the shape of looming regulations. And Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;threat report&#8221; states that the tech giant took down and publicly reported only 150 such operations over the report period.</p>
<p>Yet as we know from Facebook whistleblower Sophie Zhang, the scale of the problem of mass malicious manipulation activity on Facebook&#8217;s platform is vast and its response to it is both under-resourced and PR-led. (A memo written by the former Facebook data scientist, covered by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">BuzzFeed</a> last year, detailed a lack of institutional support for her work and how takedowns of influence operations could almost immediately respawn &#8212; without Facebook doing anything.)</p>
<p>(NB: If it&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;broader enforcement against deceptive tactics that do not rise to the level of [Coordinate Inauthentic Behavior]&#8221; that you&#8217;re looking for, rather than efforts against &#8220;influence operations&#8221;, it has a whole other report for that &#8212; the <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Inauthentic-Behavior-Report-October-2020.pdf">Inauthentic Behavior Report</a>! &#8212; because of course Facebook gets to mark its own homework when it comes to tackling fake activity, and shapes its own level of transparency exactly because there are no legally binding reporting rules on disinformation.)</p>
<p>Legally binding rules on handling online disinformation aren&#8217;t in the EU&#8217;s pipeline either &#8212; but commissioners said today that they wanted a beefed-up and &#8220;more binding&#8221; code.</p>
<p>They do have some levers to pull here via a wider package of digital reforms that&#8217;s working its way through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process right now (aka the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a>).</p>
<p>The DSA will bring in legally binding rules for how platforms handle illegal content. And the Commission intends its tougher disinformation code to plug into that (in the form of what they call a &#8220;co-regulatory backstop&#8221;).</p>
<p>It still won&#8217;t be legally binding but it may earn willing platforms extra DSA compliance &#8220;cred&#8221;. So it looks like disinformation-muck-spreaders&#8217; arms are set to be twisted in a pincer regulatory move by the EU making sure this stuff is looped, as an adjunct, to the legally binding regulation.</p>
<p>At the same time, Brussels maintains that it does not want to legislate around disinformation. The risks of taking a centralized approach might smell like censorship &#8212; and it sounds keen to avoid that charge at all costs.</p>
<p>The digital regulation packages that the EU has put forward since the 2019 collage took up its mandate are generally aimed at increasing transparency, safety and accountability online, its values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, said today.</p>
<p>Breton also said that now is the &#8220;right time&#8221; to deepen obligations under the disinformation code &#8212; with the DSA incoming &#8212; and also to give the platforms time to adapt (and involve themselves in discussions on shaping additional obligations).</p>
<p>In another interesting remark Breton also talked about regulators needing to &#8220;be able to audit platforms&#8221; &#8212; in order to be able to &#8220;check what is happening with the algorithms that push these practices&#8221;.</p>
<p>Though quite how audit powers can be made to fit with a voluntary, non-legally binding code remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Discussing areas where the current code has fallen short, Jourova pointed to inconsistencies of application across different EU Member States and languages.</p>
<p>She also said the Commission is keen for the beefed-up code to do more to empower users to act when they see something dodgy online &#8212; such as by providing users with tools to flag problem content. Platforms should also provide users with the ability to appeal disinformation content takedowns (to avoid the risk of opinions being incorrectly removed), she said.</p>
<p>The focus for the code would be on tackling false &#8220;facts not opinions&#8221;, she emphasized, saying the Commission wants platforms to &#8220;embed fact-checking into their systems&#8221; &#8212; and for the code to work toward a &#8220;decentralized care of facts&#8221;.</p>
<p>She went on to say that the current signatories to the code haven&#8217;t provided external researchers with the kind of data access the Commission would like to see &#8212; to support greater transparency into (and accountability around) the disinformation problem.</p>
<p>The code does require either monthly (for COVID-19 disinformation), six-monthly or yearly reports from signatories (depending on the size of the entity). But what&#8217;s been provided so far doesn&#8217;t add up to a comprehensive picture of disinformation activity and platform reaction, she said.</p>
<p>She also warned that online manipulation tactics are fast evolving and highly innovative &#8212; while also saying the Commission would like to see signatories agree on a set of identifiable &#8220;problematic techniques&#8221; to help speed up responses.</p>
<p>In a separate but linked move, EU lawmakers will be coming with a specific plan for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">tackling political ads transparency</a> in November, she noted.</p>
<p>They are also, in parallel, working on how to respond to the threat posed to European democracies by foreign interference CyberOps &#8212; such as the aforementioned influence operations which are often found thriving on Facebook&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The commissioners did not give many details on those plans today but Jourova said it&#8217;s &#8220;high time to impose costs on perpetrators&#8221; &#8212; suggesting that some interesting possibilities may be being considered, such as trade sanctions for state-backed DisOps (although attribution would be one challenge).</p>
<p>Breton said countering foreign influence over the &#8220;informational space&#8221;, as he referred to it, is important work to defend the values of European democracy.</p>
<p>He also said the Commission&#8217;s anti-disinformation efforts will focus on support for education to help equip EU citizens with the necessary critical thinking capabilities to navigate the huge quantities (of variable quality) information that now surrounds them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese-backed and Africa-focused fintech platform OPay is in talks to raise up to $400 million, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/china-backed-african-digital-startup-opay-raising-400-million-to-fuel-expansion">The Information reported</a> today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraising is coming two years after OPay announced two funding rounds in 2019 &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/opera-founded-starup-opay-raises-50m-for-mobile-finance-in-nigeria/">$50 million</a> in June and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/operas-africa-fintech-startup-opay-gains-120m-from-chinese-investors/">$120 million Series B</a> in November</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $170 million raised so far came from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chinese investors who have collectively begun to bet big on African startups over the past few years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them include SoftBank, Sequoia Capital China, IDG Capital, SoftBank Ventures Asia, GSR Ventures and Source Code Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Opera, popularly known for its internet search engine and browser, launched the OPay mobile money platform in Lagos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&#8217;t take long for the company to expand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the city using ORide, a now-defunct ride-hailing service, as an entry point to the array of services it wanted to offer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he company has tested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verticals &#8212; OBus, a bus-booking platform (also defunct); OExpress, a logistics delivery service; OTrade, a B2B e-commerce platform; OFood, a food delivery service, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While none of these services has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scaled, OPay&#8217;s fintech and mobile money arm (which is its main play) is thriving</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, its parent company Opera reported that OPay&#8217;s monthly transactions grew 4.5x last year to over $2 billion in December</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPay also claims to process about 80% of bank transfers among mobile money operators in Nigeria and 20% of the country&#8217;s non-merchant point of sales transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company also said it acquired an international money transfer license with a WorldRemit partnership also in the works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>OPay plays in an extremely competitive fintech market. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s most populous nation, and with a <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/archives/sub-saharan-africa">large share of its people underbanked and unbanked</a>, fintech is arguably the most promising digital sector in the country. The same can be said for the continent as a whole. Mobile money services have long catered to the needs of the underbanked, and per GSMA, Africa had more than 160 million active mobile money users generating over $495 billion in transaction value last year.</p>
<p>While fintech upstarts like OPay and Paga are trying to capture as much market share as possible, telcos like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/mtn-group-values-mobile-money-arm-at-5-billion-considers-ipo">MTN</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/airtel-africa-receives-additional-100m-for-its-mobile-money-business-from-mastercard/">Airtel</a>, with operations in multiple African countries, are spinning off mobile money service arms as billion-dollar businesses to compete as well.</p>

<p>With the money OPay has raised so far, i<span style="font-weight: 400;">t&#8217;s quite surprising that the country until last year December was only present in Nigeria. None of its plans to expand to South Africa and Kenya (countries it expressed interest in during its Series B) has come to fruition yet. Although the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company blamed the pandemic for these shortcomings, it has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set up shop in North Africa by expanding to Egypt this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This next raise, likely a Series C, will be instrumental in the company&#8217;s plans for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and product offerings expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to The Information, OPay&#8217;s valuation will increase to about $1.5 billion, three times what it was worth back in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reached out to OPay for confirmation but they declined to comment at this time.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Headless&#8221; commerce &#8212; a set of tools that companies can use with their own customized front ends to build apps for selling goods and services &#8212; have become a huge business, not just because companies are seeing a bigger demand than ever before for people buying online, but because those companies are generally more focused in their own strategies around how and what they want to present to the world.</p>
<p>Today, one of the companies building headless tools is announcing a round of funding as it continues to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://commercelayer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commerce Layer</a>, which provides a set of APIs for businesses to build e-commerce apps with their own, customized front ends, has raised $16 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue expanding its business and adding more commerce tools into its API library.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently Commerce Layer provides tools to build your own mobile, wearable and voice apps, point of sale solutions, subscriptions, and multi-vendor commerce models (as you might have in a marketplace), along with services like building your own shopping carts and turning print catalogues into interactive, &#8220;shoppable&#8221; digital experiences.</p>
<p>Filippo Conforti, the CEO and co-founder, said it plans to bring in a lot of new features. On the roadmap are a new developer dashboard, a command-line interface (CLI) and order management system, and a hosted checkout application, metrics API, a reporting application, and better support for subscription and marketplace models.</p>
<p>This latest Series B round is being led by Coatue Management, with general partner Caryn Marooney (who has led comms at Facebook, among many other high-ranking comms roles) taking a seat on Commerce Layer&#8217;s board. Previous investors Benchmark and Mango Capital also participated. Benchmark led Commerce Layer&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/italys-commerce-layer-raises-6m-led-by-benchmark-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A about a year ago</a>.</p>
<p>That round came at a very key moment for the startup. Based just outside of Florence, Italy, and coming just on the heels of the first rush of COVID-19 cases in Europe &#8212; where for a time Italy was the epicenter of the pandemic &#8212; it was an early sign not just of how startups were able to keep working, but how investors were willing to back the best of them, even in times of uncertainty.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=Q0n2iP2FDY" data-secret="Q0n2iP2FDY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It also turned out that e-commerce became one of the big stories out of 2020, as more consumers went to digital channels to shop at a time when they couldn&#8217;t go to stores as easily, if at all.</p>
<p>That has definitely had a knock-on effect for Commerce Layer. Conforti told me that the company saw its revenues grow 6x in the last year &#8212; albeit it was starting from a small place, with only six customers on its books back in May 2020. It now has around 26 businesses using its tools, he said, including Chilly&#8217;s, Brioni, SumUp, Paradox Interactive and Coca-Cola Embonor (a company that works under a Coca-Cola license to make and distribute drinks in Chile and Bolivia).</p>
<p>The interesting thing about &#8220;headless&#8221; platforms is that they are becoming a much bigger part of the equation when it comes to building and running e-commerce experiences. That seems to be a sign not just of how the sector continues to mature in terms of retailers and how they are looking for more than a plug-and-play, one-size-fits-most approach in their own strategies. It also speaks to the growing range of permutations of how and where people sell today, and the need for tools to address that.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/commercetools-raises-145m-from-insight-for-shopify-style-e-commerce-apis-for-large-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercetools</a> is one of the bigger &#8220;headless&#8221; commerce providers, and whose founder even coined the term &#8220;headless commerce&#8221;, there are a number of others now building tools to help companies build more unique e-commerce experiences, including the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chord</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun</a>. Even Shopify has stepped into the fray with Shopify Plus.</p>
<p>“eCommerce has become core to our everyday lives. As a result, big brands and enterprises need better ways to shift from retail and build exceptional online storefronts. We believe that Commerce Layer is building the API platform for this new category, and we’re incredibly proud to join them in pursuing their ambitious and exciting vision,&#8221; said Marooney in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last time humans visited the moon, in 1972, they got around on a relatively simple battery-powered vehicle. As NASA prepares for the next crewed mission to the moon, it’s looking to give the lunar rover an upgrade.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin and General Motors said Wednesday they&#8217;re working together to develop a next-generation lunar vehicle designed to be faster and capable of traveling farther distances than its predecessor. If the project is selected by NASA, the rover would be used on the upcoming Artemis missions. The first mission, which will be an uncrewed test flight, is scheduled for November. The request for proposals will likely be published in the third or fourth quarter of this year, executives said at a media briefing Wednesday. NASA will award the contract after evaluating the submitted proposals.</p>
<p>The previous rover was only capable of traveling less than five miles from the Apollo landing site, limiting the astronauts’ ability to collect important data on far-flung lunar locales, like the north and south poles. The moon’s circumference is nearly 7,000 miles. The two companies are aiming to improve the specs, Lockheed’s VP for lunar exploration Kirk Shireman said, noting that the exact materials used for the new rover, its range and other capabilities have yet to be determined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM will also be developing an autonomous driving system for the rover, which executives said Wednesday will improve safety and the ability for astronauts to collect samples and conduct other scientific research. GM is investing more than $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicle technologies through 2025, and it aims to bring that research to the lunar rover project, Jeffrey Ryder, VP of growth and strategy at GM Defense, said. “We’re heads-down right now in investigating how we would take those capabilities and apply them to specific missions and operation associated with the Artemis program.”</p>
<p>GM also said it will be using its earth-bound research into battery and propulsion systems in developing the rover. Ryder anticipates that the rover program will lead to other market opportunities.</p>

<p>Both companies have supplied technology for NASA missions before, including its lunar missions. Auto manufacturer GM helped develop the lunar rover that was used during the Apollo era, including its chassis and wheels. It also manufactured and integrated guidance and navigational systems for the program. Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin’s experience extends to building spacecraft and power systems that have been included on every NASA mission to Mars.</p>
<p>The companies said this was “one of several initiatives” they’re working on together, with further announcements regarding other projects expected in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://prismic.io">Prismic</a>, a company building a content management system, has raised a $20 million Series A funding round. While the startup has been profitable since 2016, it wants to unlock the full potential of its headless CMS by iterating more quickly on its product. Aglaé Ventures and Eurazeo are co-leading today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Headless content management systems are a bit different from traditional content management systems. The backend and the frontend of your website operate totally separately. You write content in the backend where it is safely stored. The frontend of your application fetches content from the backend using an API and displays it to your customers and readers.</p>
<p>Dissociating those two key parts of your content management system provides many advantages. It is more secure, it scales much better and it gives you a ton of flexibility when it comes to frontend framework and hosting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to iterating on its CMS, Prismic manages the infrastructure for you. When you sign up, you don’t have to deploy the backend on your own server. You can connect to the admin interface and start building.</p>
<p>After that, your content is accessible through an API. It means that you can build your own website and fetch content from Prismic. You can also build a mobile app and use Prismic as your content backend for the news section.</p>
<p>You can pick your own framework and build your site through that framework. Prismic supports Gatsby, React.js, Next.js, Vue.js and more.</p>
<p>Prismic is also trying to popularize something called <a href="https://prismic.io/announcement/from-headless-cms-to-custom-website-builder">slices</a>. Traditional content management systems let you create pages or posts. Each page uses the same header and footer. It’s just a unit of content enclosed in your website.</p>
<p>Slices are vertical sections of your websites, such as a banner at the top, a section with featured content, some related content, recent reviews, a newsletter sign-up form, etc. Developers can create their own custom slices using React.js, Vue.js and others.</p>
<p>After that, the content marketing team can mix and match slices as well as customize them whenever they’re creating a new page. It unlocks more potential and lets non-technical people create dynamic content for a website. Essentially, Prismic is adding some no-code features to its CMS with those slices.</p>
<p>“Prismic becomes a page builder for the marketing team. From there, they can access all sections of the site and can compose new pages by piecing together those slices and by adding content,” co-founder and CEO Sadek Drobi told me.</p>
<p>That concept in particular seems to have some potential. That’s why the company is raising some money. The startup generates revenue from subscriptions and targets small clients, such as web agencies, as well as big companies that subscribe to enterprise plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.merlinlabs.co/">Merlin Labs</a> founder Matt George was learning to fly in Vermont, he had a close call with a JetBlue aircraft that was coming into Burlington airport. It was “an unsettling experience,” he told TechCrunch, but one that stuck with him. A few years later, after the transportation company he founded (Bridj) was acquired by Singapore-based Transit Systems, he started thinking about how he could bring to the air the innovations that were taking place in autonomous ground transportation.</p>
<p>Now, two-and-a-half years after founding Merlin Labs, the company is coming out of stealth with a 55-aircraft partnership with aviation solutions company Dynamic Aviation. The company also announced that it has raised $3.5 million in seed funding and $21.5 million in Series A, led by First Round Capital and GV (formerly Google Ventures) respectively, with additional investments from Floodgate, Harpoon, WTI, Ben Ling, Box Group, Shrug Capital and Howard Morgan.</p>
<p>Merlin Labs’ has performed “a couple hundred” autonomous missions from takeoff to touchdown across the three generations of its experimental system, George said. It&#8217;s been conducting its flight tests from a dedicated facility at the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port. The latest iteration, called Murray, is a few months old. He described the system as a drop-in autonomy kit that can be adapted across aircrafts. While there is a human pilot monitoring the aircraft on the ground that can take over in case of an emergency, planes retrofitted with Merlin Labs’ system operate on their own.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2157457" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157457" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157457 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png?w=235" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png?resize=235,300 235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png?resize=532,680 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3-1.png?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.merlinlabs.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merlin Labs <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>However, before the fleet of 55 King Air planes can take to the skies for commercial service, Merlin Labs still needs to get a supplemental type certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. George was unable to provide a timeline of when Merlin Labs might get the certification but it’s a necessary process in an industry that’s highly regulated and justifiably risk averse.</p>
<p>The company is also certifying capability to allow air traffic controllers to “talk” to the aircraft directly, using natural language processing so that the aircraft understands the words and can translate it into action. The plane will also be able to respond with “a high degree of cognition,” George said.</p>
<p>“We firmly believe that air traffic controllers need to be able to interact with the aircraft just like they would interact with any other aircraft,” he said. “There shouldn&#8217;t be any special interfaces. They should be able to go talk to it, have the aircraft perform those actions, and talk back. So that&#8217;s a really important part we’re working on.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, George said that Merlin Labs has no intention of becoming an airline or operating planes themselves. Instead, it’s looking to provide autonomy as a service to more providers like Dynamic Aviation (which owns the largest private fleet of King Air planes) and logistics giants like UPS and FedEx.</p>
<p>“Autonomy is eating the world,” George said. “The opportunity to be able to go automate the airspace is really important, to be able to bring people together, to create digital infrastructure that connects the entire world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say at-home exercise giant Peloton and its closest rival Echelon were not stripping user-uploaded profile photos of their metadata, in some cases exposing users&#8217; real-world location data.</p>
<p>Almost every file, photo or document contains metadata, which is data about the file itself, such as how big it is, when it was created and by whom. Photos and video will often also include the location from where they were taken. That location data helps online services tag your photos or videos that you were at this restaurant or that other landmark.</p>
<p>But those online services — especially social platforms, where you see people&#8217;s profile photos — are supposed to remove location data from the file&#8217;s metadata so other users can&#8217;t snoop on where you&#8217;ve been, since location data can reveal where you live, where you work, where you go and who you see.</p>
<p>Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found the metadata exposure as part of a wider look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">at Peloton&#8217;s leaky API</a>. TechCrunch verified the bug by uploading a profile photo with GPS coordinates of our New York office, and checking the metadata of the file while it was on the server.</p>
<p>The bugs were privately reported to both Peloton and Echelon.</p>
<p>Peloton fixed its API issues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">earlier this month</a> but said it needed more time to fix the metadata bug and to strip existing profile photos of any location data. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed the bugs were fixed last week. Echelon fixed its version of the bug <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/echelon-leaky-api-riders-account-data/">earlier this month</a>. But TechCrunch held this report until we had confirmation that both companies had fixed the bug and that metadata had been stripped from old profile photos.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known how long the bug existed or if anyone maliciously exploited it to scrape users&#8217; personal information. Any copies, whether cached or scraped, could represent a significant privacy risk to users whose location identifies their home address, workplace or other private location.</p>
<p>Parler infamously <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-hack-data-public-posts-images-video/">didn&#8217;t scrub metadata</a> from user-uploaded photos, which exposed the locations of millions of users when archivists exploited weaknesses on the platform&#8217;s API to download its entire contents. Others have been slow to adopt metadata stripping, like Slack, even if it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/slack-strips-location-data/">got there in the end</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://datacy.com/">Datacy</a>, a startup with its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/datacy-1/about/">headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware</a>, announced that it has closed $2.4 million in new funding to continue building its consumer-friendly data collection and monetization service.</p>
<p>The company is effectively an argument that the preceding sentence is possible. Datacy is a tool that allows individuals to collect their browsing data, manage it, have it anonymized and aggregated with others and then sold. The end-user gets 85% of the resulting revenue, while Datacy takes 15%.</p>
<p>Its model has found financial backing, with its new capital coming from Trend Forward Capital, Truesight Ventures, Redhawk VC, the Female Founders Alliance and others. The startup raised the funds using a convertible note that was capped at $9.5 million, though TechCrunch is not certain whether or not there were other terms associated with the fundraising mechanism.</p>
<p>Regardless, Datacy&#8217;s model fits into the modestly more privacy-forward stance that the technology world has taken in recent years; Apple is not the only company looking to make hay off of what some consider to be rising consumer interest in keeping their activities, and data, to themselves. But what Datacy wants to do is merge the consumer privacy impulse with profit.</p>
<p>According to company co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/indiloparoma?lang=en">Paroma Indilo</a>, her startup is not a cookie blocker. She told TechCrunch that if someone wants to block data collection, there are good tools for the task in the market already. What Datacy wants to do, she said, is evolve from its current status as a control platform to the way that data is shared and exchanged, built atop user consent. With monetization, we&#8217;d add.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a better vision for the future than the hellscape adtech and data-vendor market that we&#8217;ve become accustomed to.</p>
<p>Today the startup has live beta users, allowing it to learn and collect initial data. The company is waiting to make the business side of its operation open to all until it has 50,000 users; Indilo told TechCrunch that individual data is not worth much, but in aggregate it can be worth quite a lot. So to see the startup wait to scale up its sales operations until it has a larger user base is reasonable.</p>
<p>It may not be too long until Datacy reaches that 50,000 user mark. From a current base of 10,000, and what Indilo described as 30% monthly growth via word of mouth, it could hit that mark in a half-year or so.</p>
<p>Datacy is one of those early-stage bets that has a lot of potential, but also a notable helping of risk. If it can attract the masses it needs to prove out the economics of its model, its payments to its user base could make growth a self-fulfilling destiny. But if its ability to garner more users slows, it could fail to reach sufficient scale for its model to work whatsoever.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a good use of venture capital, in other words. We&#8217;ll check back in with Datacy in a few months to see how close it is to its 50,000 user goal. And how its bet that consumers want their data back is playing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://databricks.com">Databricks</a> launched its fifth open-source project today, a new tool called <a href="https://delta.io/sharing">Delta Sharing</a> designed to be a vendor-neutral way to share data with any cloud infrastructure or SaaS product, so long as you have the appropriate connector. It&#8217;s part of the broader Databricks open-source <a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake project</a>.</p>
<p>As CEO Ali Ghodsi points out, data is exploding, and moving data from Point A to Point B is an increasingly difficult problem to solve with proprietary tooling. &#8220;The number one barrier for organizations to succeed with data is sharing data, sharing it between different views, sharing it across organizations &#8212; that&#8217;s the number one issue we&#8217;ve seen in organizations,&#8221; Ghodsi explained.</p>
<p>Delta Sharing is an open-source protocol designed to solve that problem. &#8220;This is the industry&#8217;s first-ever open protocol, an open standard for sharing a data set securely. [&#8230;] They can standardize on Databricks or something else. For instance, they might have standardized on using AWS Data Exchange, Power BI or Tableau &#8212; and they can then access that data securely.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tool is designed to work with multiple cloud infrastructure and SaaS services and out of the gate there are multiple partners involved, including the Big Three cloud infrastructure vendors Amazon, Microsoft and Google, as well as data visualization and management vendors like Qlik, Starburst, Collibra and Alation and data providers like Nasdaq, S&amp;P and Foursquare</p>
<p>Ghodsi said the key to making this work is the open nature of the project. By doing that and donating it to The Linux Foundation, he is trying to ensure that it can work across different environments. Another big aspect of this is the partnerships and the companies involved. When you can get big-name companies involved in a project like this, it&#8217;s more likely to succeed because it works across this broad set of popular services. In fact, there are a number of connectors available today, but Databricks expects that number to increase over time as contributors build more connectors to other services.</p>

<p>Databricks operates on a consumption pricing model much like Snowflake, meaning the more data you move through its software, the more money it&#8217;s going to make, but the Delta Sharing tool means you can share with anyone, not just another Databricks customer. Ghodsi says that the open-source nature of Delta Sharing means his company can still win, while giving customers more flexibility to move data between services.</p>
<p>The infrastructure vendors also love this model because the cloud data lake tools move massive amounts of data through their services and they make money too, which probably explains why they are all on board with this.</p>
<p>One of the big fears of modern cloud customers is being tied to a single vendor as they often were in the 1990s and early 2000s when most companies bought a stack of services from a single vendor like Microsoft, IBM or Oracle. On one hand, you had the veritable single throat to choke, but you were beholden to the vendor because the cost of moving to another one was prohibitively high. Companies don&#8217;t want to be locked in like that again and open source tooling is one way to prevent that.</p>
<p>Databricks was founded in 2013 and has raised almost $2 billion. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">latest round was in February</a> for $1 billion at a $28 billion valuation, an astonishing number for a private company. Snowflake, a primary competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/snowflakes-ipo-could-value-it-as-high-as-24b-salesforce-and-berkshire-to-invest/">went public last September</a>. As of today, it has a market cap of over $66 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another mobility SPAC deal. This time, it’s <a href="https://tritiumcharging.com/">Tritium</a>, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers that is taking the SPAC path to the public market in a deal valuing the company at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Tritium said Wednesday it will be heading to the Nasdaq via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II, or DCRN, though it declined to provide a timeline for when the transaction is expected to close. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker “DCFC.”</p>
<p>This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE — a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We didn’t need a PIPE because DCRN is a more than $400 million SPAC and our shareholder group agreed to a minimum cash closing of just $200 million, which significantly reduces redemption risk,&#8221; Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, our revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since 2016 as we expand our presence in major markets where we have a significant market share, such as the U.S. and Europe. This revenue growth helps to reduce our reliance upon new funds to implement our growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2001, Tritium manufactures charger hardware and software for direct current fast chargers. Its products can recharge an EV battery, adding 20 miles in a minute or 100 miles in five minutes, DPAC II chairman Robert Tichio said during an investors call Wednesday. DC chargers are more costly than alternating current (AC) chargers but they send power to the vehicle much more quickly. Generally, AC chargers are installed at home, where a driver can plug in their vehicle overnight, while DC chargers are more frequently found at public charging stations.</p>
<p>“Drivers will want the experience of public charging to be as close as possible to their current experience at the gas pump &#8212; just a few minutes to get enough range to get on with your day,” Hunter said.</p>
<p>Tritium’s largest market is Europe, which composes around 70% of the company’s revenue, followed by North America at 20% and Asia at 10%, Hunter told investors Wednesday. The company will use the capital from the transaction to expand its manufacturing capacity and grow sales.</p>
<p>Demand for public EV charging stations is expected to mushroom over the next two decades alongside the growing market share of EVs. According to analysts Grandview Research, the EV charging infrastructure market was valued at $2 billion in 2020. It is expected to grow by nearly 39% through 2028. President Joe Biden said building out a national EV charging network was a key priority under his proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan.</p>
