										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leave it to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lenovo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lenovo">Lenovo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to give the world a swiveling all-in-one. It’s kind of the company’s M.O. – not always the most necessary or practical, but never not interesting. When it comes to fairly staid product categories like this, I&#8217;m all for trying something a little weird. And hey, in a world of convertible and two-in-one the devices, the big, heavy AIO has always been a hold out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the why here.</p>
<p>I suppose there at least a handful of reason you would want a vertical screen. If, say, you’re a journalist who endless scrolls through news feeds. Though, honestly, the idea of looking at Twitter on a vertical 27-inch 4K display makes me break out into a cold sweat these days. Like the swiveling Samsung TV before it, the form factor allows you view content in portrait mode a la your handset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And like the Sero, it’s hard to imagine too many users deeming such a feature necessary. I could probably see myself using it one or twice a year. It might also be a bonus while doing spring cleaning. Of course, there’s always the possibility that opening a new screen orientation option could go a ways toward adapting your workflow.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>All in all it’s not a bad looking all-in-one. The 4K screen includes some solid color features, per Lenovo,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yoga AIO 7 affords peerless 4K visuals and more authentic colors than you’ve ever seen before on screen through the 99% Adobe RGB color gamut and a hyperrealistic DCI-P3 99% color space. It’s also designed in accordance with professional-grade display requirements, adopting DC dimming, carrying Flicker-Free and Low Blue Light dual certifications from TUV Rheinland and OSD functionality to facilitate display settings.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can cast your mobile device directly to the desktop, which is mostly where the rotating screen comes in. It ships with 16 or 32GB of RAM, and between 256GB-1TB of solid state storage. There’s also a standard hard drive option that comes in either 1 or 2TB.</p>
<p>It’s available now in China and will hit additional markets next month, priced at $1,599. North America may or may not ultimately be one of those markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a>, a multinational startup that builds software to help other companies manage their corporate planning, announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B. The round was led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight</a>, and included both participation from new investor <a href="https://singular.vc/">Singular</a>, and prior investors <a href="https://launchub.com/">LauncHub</a> and <a href="https://crv.com/">CRV</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gtmhub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gtmhub">Gtmhub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> raised capital around 13 months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/gtmhub-raises-9m-from-crv-after-posting-400-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/">a $9 million Series A</a>. At the time, the new capital was larger than the aggregate of its preceding funding efforts. The startup&#8217;s new funding round, like its 2019 Series A, towers above its prior fundraising totals in a similar manner.</p>
<p>How has Gtmhub managed to raise so much money? In a word, growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported at the time of its Series A that Gtmhub had managed 400% growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) heading into the round, on a year-over-year basis. Similar levels of topline expansion have continued, with Gtmhub COO Seth Elliott telling TechCrunch that the company grew its ARR by a multiple of three last year (measured December 2019 through December 2020).</p>
<p>Around the time when Gtmhub raised in 2019, a number of other startups focused on the same software market raised as well, leading to TechCrunch asking &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">why is everyone making OKR software?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The acronym OKR translates to &#8220;objectives and key results,&#8221; a planning method that has become popular among American technology firms, and, according to Elliott, is becoming more popular internationally and among non-technology companies.</p>
<p>The startup executive also told TechCrunch that he sees Gtmhub growing alongside two business trends. The first, the rise of OKRs themselves, is a wave that his company is riding, he told TechCrunch. The second, one that he thinks his startup is leading, deals with large companies pursuing corporate transformations to boost their agility; those firms are adopting Gtmhub, he said, which can help them execute their digital transformation, or similar efforts successfully.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a big surprise that large companies looking to rejuvenate their operations might want a new planning method to help keep their staff pointing in the same direction, and Gtmhub has long had an enterprise bent.</p>
<p>That enterprise focus performed well for the company last year, we learned. TechCrunch asked the company for updates on its annual contract value (ACV) results and gross margin levels during our discussion of its new round. In 2019, at the time of its Series A, the company said that it had grown its ACV by 650% in the preceding year. The COO told TechCrunch that that figure rose by a factor of ten in 2020, implying success in selling to large companies. And, Elliott added, the total number of paying users of the service also rose by a factor of ten during the year.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s gross margins held up to their roughly 90% levels set in 2019, it said.</p>
<p>Given those results, it&#8217;s not a surprise that Gtmhub was able to raise another round more quickly than the startup-standard 18 month timeline would have had us estimate.</p>
<p>The round came together quickly. According to Elliott, Gtmhub started to chat with investors outside of a formal process in early November, kicking off a more serious effort to raise capital by the end of that month. The round was closed as 2020 concluded.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It will be interesting to see if other startups working on the software category that also raised money around a year ago will also now raise more capital. The names on our watch list regarding that question include <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a> and <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>. There are other players in the space as well, like <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a>, that we&#8217;d love to hear from when it comes to their own 2020 growth.</span></p>
<p>Gtmhub declined to share its 2021 growth plans with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The larger lesson from this round is that even inside of a software niche that you might have dismissed as overly narrow &#8212; namely OKR-focused software &#8212; is in fact large enough to support a handful of high-growth startups. That applies broadly, and underscores a little of the pace of the venture and startup industries in the last few quarters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital product design &#8212; the process of building services like websites and apps that work without bugs and as you intend them to &#8212; has come into focus as an especially important thing to get right in the last year. With more customers using sites and apps to interact with a business, if something is broken or just isn&#8217;t working that well, you can lose them much more easily than in the past in physical spaces, when store assistants might help, or the customer might simply get distracted and interested by another product.</p>
<p>Today, one of the startups building tools to help with digital product design is announcing a huge round of funding, a sign of the urgency and interest in the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quantummetric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Metric</a>, which provides a cloud-based service both to build digital products, and then test and fix them in real time to improve how they work, sold by the company as Continuous Digital Product Design, has picked up $200 million in funding, a Series B round that values the company at over $1 billion. This is a significant upround for the startup, with 9.2-fold increase compared to its valuation in 2018, according to Mario Ciabarra, the founder and CEO of Quantum Metric.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is a significant round for the company also in the context of its previous fundraising, which up to now totaled $50 million from just three named investors: Bain, Hangar 51 and Insight.</p>
<p>Now, the Series B is being led by Insight Partners with other backers undisclosed. Insight is shaping up to be a huge and prolific backer of companies focused on building better customer service experiences in our current, socially-distanced and very digital economy: just earlier today, the same partner that led this round for Quantum Metric, managing director Lonne Jaffe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/glia-raises-78m-for-its-integrated-hands-on-ai-based-customer-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">led a $78 million round in Glia</a>, a platform to help customer service agents do their work more easily.</p>
<p>Ciabarra has built his company out of Colorado, and it somewhat feels like the DNA of being &#8220;remote&#8221; from the Bay Area has fueled how the company&#8217;s own product has been developed, with the idea being that you don&#8217;t need to be on the ground and in the room with someone to be able to identify when they are unhappy. Indeed, being remote is an asset.</p>
<p>The company, through its customer base of enterprises, collects data interactions that cover some 1 billion internet users and some 20% of all internet activity, he said, &#8220;capturing experiences to see where people are frustrated on the web and in native apps. Our focus is on friction and frustration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quantum Metric is part devops, and part martech. When it is used, its customers can in turn monitor when their customers are clicking too much trying to get something done, or clicking and navigating away. It logs these actions, and then suggests ways to fix them.</p>
<p>That focus on looking for bad online experiences seems to follow him wherever he goes: the first thing Ciabarra talked to me about when we spoke for this article was about how bad the experience was for his 12 year old daughter &#8220;while trying to buy a bed online for her birthday&#8221; when she couldn&#8217;t immediate see a bed she wanted appear in her cart. (Yes, some 12 year-olds buy beds for themselves online, it seems. I&#8217;ll make sure my kids don&#8217;t know about this.)</p>
<p class="p5">“Economic downturns have a way of shining a light on high-growth ScaleUps that are particularly compelling to customers, and this year, the surging customer demand for Quantum Metric’s product from customers hit hard by the pandemic, has been extraordinary,” said Jaffe in a statement. “Quantum Metric lets enterprises use real-time qualitative and quantitative data to take the guesswork out of improving their digital features and products. We are excited to double down on our partnership with the Quantum Metric team as they bring their powerful analytics capabilities to customers across the world.”</p>
<p class="p6">The company today counts large internet and offline brands among its customers, with the list including Alaska Airlines, Crate and Barrel, Lenovo, Western Union, Lulu Lemon and Fanduel, and Ciabarra claims that it has held a 98% gross retention of that base, despite the aggressive competition from the likes of <a href="https://www2.logrocket.com/signup-awr?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11193814533&amp;utm_group=110127979872&amp;utm_term=quantum%20metric&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX0eIGcQyOJXMTS9VpoUfLVutQSbE34WJm2p5n5Y1gPT0tgcvkrtmgBoCPUkQAvD_BwE#utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11193814533&amp;utm_group=110127979872&amp;utm_term=quantum%2520metric&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX0eIGcQyOJXMTS9VpoUfLVutQSbE34WJm2p5n5Y1gPT0tgcvkrtmgBoCPUkQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log Rocket</a> and <a href="https://decibel.com/lp-demo-ppc-quantummetric/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=competitor-usa&amp;utm_content=quantum-metric-em&amp;utm_term=quantum+metric&amp;_bt=457844989831&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX4_VZZZzsKNHK2ow0kJL3IBIk-gf7SBob635neMvfZAQn7BwZaQ93RoClW0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decibel</a>, which actively market themselves in comparison to it. There is still a lot of opportunity, though, as the market continues to push ahead and not just shift online, but start to look like it&#8217;s here to stay.</p>
<p class="p8">Before Covid, Ciabarra said, &#8220;just 10-15% of transactions were online. That&#8217;s flipped, with only 10% in person now.&#8221; And the reason it&#8217;s having traction, he added, is not just because of how customer interactions are changing, &#8220;but because company cultures are changing, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy almost CES! Sure the year’s biggest consumer electronics show hasn’t officially kicked off, but, well, what do such arbitrary signposts really mean in a year like 2021, right? Samsung just dropped what’s almost certainly one of its biggest pieces of news for the show, with the arrival of the Galaxy Chromebook 2.</p>
<p>The two-in-one follows almost a year to a day after the announcement of the original. It appears to share a fair bit of the charm of its predecessor, but notably has a much improvement price point. This time out the Chrome OS powered portable starts at a far more reasonable $549 – down from $999.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093131" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093131" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2093131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mind you, that’s for the one running a 10th gen Intel Celeron processor. If you want the Core i3, that starts at $699. It’s a bit of a jump, but a better starting point for users looking at the product as day-to-day machine. And besides, it’s still significantly less expensive than the original. Keep in mind here that last year’s model started with an i5 – which is to say the price drop comes with a bit of a processor downgrade.</p>
<p>Battery life was an issue on the original and is still a bit of a question here. The device now sports a QLED display (which Samsung claims is “world’s first” for a Chromebook), rather than the original’s 4K AMOLED, which could go a ways toward improving longevity.</p>
<p>The changes between the first and second gen product are a pretty clear indicator that companies are still trying to figure out precisely what a “premium Chromebook” entails. After all, it wasn’t all that long ago that the phrase was a bit of an oxymoron. The company’s computing GM Shoneel Kolhatkar sums up the general though process here pretty well in the associated press announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>Many kids grew up using Chromebooks in school, and as they enter the workforce, their needs evolve, they’re looking for premium, powerful hardware that can elevate that intuitive Google experience. We designed the Galaxy Chromebook 2 with these users in mind, taking the popular features from Galaxy Chromebook—incredible visuals, great specs, and gorgeous design and color—and bringing them to a wider base of customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sense, Samsung is taking a similar journey as the one Google made from the Pixelbook to the Pixelbook Go. And with Google pretty quiet on that front for the moment, there’s a decent sized market opening for Samsung here.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 arrives later this quarter, sporting a 13.3 inch display, 4/8GB of RAM and 64/128GB of storage. And yes, it still comes in “Fiesta Red” or gray, if you prefer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The popular news app <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com">News Break</a> is announcing that it has raised $115 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The press release claims this round makes News Break &#8220;one of the first new unicorns of 2021,&#8221; but the startup declined to disclose its actual valuation.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zhaohui-zheng" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zhaohui-zheng">Jeff Zheng <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said that when he started the company in 2015, the goal was to differentiate itself from other news aggregation apps by focusing on local news, and to &#8220;help or empower these local content creators.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, you can find similar stories in News Break that you&#8217;d see in other news apps (there&#8217;s a whole section for coronavirus news, for example, and this morning you&#8217;ll see plenty of headlines about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">yesterday&#8217;s violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol</a>), but you&#8217;ll also see plenty stories that are highlighted specifically based on your location.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is interweaving with every aspect of the company — in how we empower local publishers and local journalists to generate content more effectively and to reach an online audience more effectively,&#8221; Zheng said. &#8220;We have AI tools to help provide all these relevant articles &#8230; We have location profiles and what you&#8217;re most interested in, which we basically match against the content.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?w=680" alt="News Break founder and CEO Jeff Zheng" width="680" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> News Break</p></div></p>
<p>The local focus may be increasingly valuable given the broader economic challenges facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/google-news-initiative-project-oasis/">the local news business</a> — as Zheng put it, there&#8217;s &#8220;strong user demand&#8221; for local news but &#8220;weak supply.&#8221; And the strategy seems to have paid off for News Break so far, with the app<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/meet-news-break-the-news-app-trending-in-america-founded-by-a-chinese-media-veteran/"> reaching the top spot</a> in the News category of the Apple&#8217;s U.S. App Store multiple times (it&#8217;s currently ranked number four), and in Google Play as well. The startup says it&#8217;s currently reaching 12 million daily active users.</p>
<p>Zheng said that while News Break already shares ad revenue with publishers, he&#8217;s hopeful that the value it provides those publishers will only grow over time: &#8220;We want to give as much money back to the creators as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I suggested that publishers and journalists may be leery about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/facebooks-news-not-yours/"> relying too much on a third-party platform</a> to reach their audience, Zheng argued that News Break&#8217;s incentives are very different from the big internet and social media platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are local-centric,&#8221; he said.&#8221;If local publishers are struggling, if the newspapers are diminishing every year, then sooner or later we are out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;ve noted in the past that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/meet-news-break-the-news-app-trending-in-america-founded-by-a-chinese-media-veteran/">News Break has Chinese roots</a> — Zheng previously led Yahoo Labs in Beijing and was also founding CEO at Chinese news startup Yidian Zixun, plus the startup has team members in Beijing and Shanghai — Zheng emphasized that that this is a &#8220;U.S. high tech company incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Mountain View,&#8221; with the majority of its workforce in the United State and a focus on the U.S. market. The distinction could become important if News Break continues to grow, given the U.S. government&#8217;s current <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">attempts to ban Chinese companies</a>.</p>
<p>News Break previously raised $36 million in funding. The new round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/francisco-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="francisco-partners">Francisco Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is taking a seat on the News Break board. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/idg-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="idg-capital-partners">IDG Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also participated.</p>
<p>In a statement, Francisco Partners Principal Alan Ni said:</p>
<blockquote><p>News Break’s breakout multi-year successes in the local news space is what first brought them to our attention. We are inspired by their mission and extremely impressed by the work they have done to bring local-news distribution into the 21st Century through cutting-edge machine learning and media savvy. We are thrilled to be partnering with News Break’s talented leadership team as they continue to drive local news innovations while also rapidly expanding their business into adjacent local verticals beyond news.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three years ago, Mercedes-Benz unveiled MBUX, an infotainment system that represented a leap forward in the legacy automotive industry. The system, with its crisp graphics, intuitive user interface and voice assistant, was closer to the experience of using a smartphone and finally got away from the pixelated screens and cluttered designs found in most modern infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Mercedes unveiled Thursday the next iteration of the MBUX, a 56-inch curved screen that runs the length of a dashboard — the central feature of a next-generation infotainment system that learns the behaviors of its driver. The MBUX Hyperscreen, as its called, will be option in the 2022 Mercedes EQS, the flagship sedan under the automaker&#8217;s electric EQ brand. The Hyperscreen, which was unveiled ahead of the virtual CES tech trade show, features 8 CPU cores, 24-gigabyte RAM and 46.4 GB per second RAM memory bandwidth. There&#8217;s a multifunction camera and a sensor that adapts the brightness of the screen depending on the lighting conditions.</p>
<p>All of this technology is meant to deliver an intuitive infotainment system that can be individualized for up to seven people. The software behind the Hyperscreen allows the system to continually get to know the customer better, according to Mercedes-Benz CTO Sajjad Khan, adding that it&#8217;s designed without the occupant needing to click or scroll anywhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The MBUX Hyperscreen is both the brain and nervous system of the car,&#8221; Khan, said in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093070" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093070" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093070 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093070" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>The curved screen, which is really several individual displays under a glass housing, is protected by two coatings of scratch-resistant aluminum silicate on the cover plate to reduce reflections and make cleaning easier. Mercedes also designed the screen with predetermined breaking points in case of a crash.</p>
<p>On either side of the curved screen are two physical air vents that have been integrated into the screen,</p>
<p>Putting the look and size of the screen aside, the user interface and how it operates is what stands out. (Althoug to be clear, we have yet to truly test it). Mercedes chose to put information on <span style="font-weight: 400;">charging, entertainment, phone, navigation, social media, connectivity and massage — yes massage — right up front on the screen. This means no scrolling through menus or using the voice assistant to locate these options. </span></p>
<p>The system&#8217;s software, which will learn the patterns of the driver, will prompt the user, removing any need to<span style="font-weight: 400;"> go deeper into the sub-menu. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">navigation map is always visible in the center and located just below</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it are the controls for the phone and entertainment – or the feature that best suits the specific situation, according to the automaker.</span></p>
<p>Mercedes leaned into the software of the system, playing up its smart features during the Thursday reveal. For instance, if the driver always calls one particular person on the way home on certain days, the system begin to anticipate that action. A business card will appear with their contact information and &#8212; if it&#8217;s stored &#8212; their photo will appear. If someone else drives the EQS on that same evening, this recommendation would not be made.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093071" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093071" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>The driver can dive deeper into the system to change settings or access other features. The front seat passenger has their own section of the screen called the co-driver display to play around with during a trip. In certain markets, the passenger will also be able to watch videos <span style="font-weight: 400;">while traveling using the Bluetooth headphones</span>. An<span style="font-weight: 400;"> intelligent camera-based locking concept will prevent the driver from looking at the passenger display to avoid distraction.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ongoing push for social distancing to slow the spread of Covid-19 has meant that more people than ever before are using internet-based services to get things done. And that is having a direct impact on digital customer service, which is seeing unprecedented traffic and demands when things are not running smoothly. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s built an interesting, very &#8220;hands-on&#8221; approach to addressing that problem is announcing a round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glia</a>, which has built a platform that not only integrates and helps manage different customer support channels, but also provides tools to help agents proactively get into a customer&#8217;s app or web page to help them find things or fix issues, is today announcing that it has picked up $78 million, a Series C. Dan Michaeli, the co-founder and CEO who is based out of New York (the company has a substantial operation in Estonia too), said will be used to continue developing its technology and expanding to address inbound interest for its services after seeing its revenues grow by 150% in 2020.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s original focus was around financial services and it counts a large base of customers in that area, but it is also seeing a lot of activity in adjacent industries like insurance, as well as education, retail and other categories Michaeli said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had overwhelming demand and it&#8217;s incredible to see how businesses want to adopt us right now,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;The plan is to significantly scale up and continue to define and meet that demand for digital customer service.&#8221; The company is likely also to use some of the funding for acquisitions in what appears to be a rapidly consolidating market.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Insight Partners, with Don Brown (an entrepreneur in the world of customer service, with his company Interactive Intelligence acquired by Genesys for $1.4 billion) also participating.</p>
<p>Glia isn&#8217;t disclosing other investors, but past backers include Tola Capital, Temerity Capital, Grassy Creek and Wildcat Capital, as well as Insight. Prior to this, the company, which has been around since 2012 and was previously known as Salemove, had raised just $28 million and its valuation was a modest $69 million <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54664-21/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to PitchBook data</a> (and it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation today).</p>
<p>While there are a lot of customer service startups in the market today, and a number of them are seeing huge boosts in their business, and even some consolidation as others snap up tech to make sure they have their own customer service strategies going in the right direction. (Witness Facebook of all companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring omnichannel customer support and CRM leader Kustomer</a> for $1 billion in November.)</p>
<p>Glia is not unlike many of the new guard of these companies, in that its focus is very squarely on providing a platform to be able to manage and interact across whatever digital channel a customer happens to be using. Glia, I should point out, means &#8220;glue&#8221; in Greek.</p>
<p>What makes Glia quite interesting and different from these are some of the twists it uses to engage with users. One of these involves being able to give agents the ability to actually get on the screen of the user in question, in order to both guide the user around the screen, and to see what the user is doing on that screen.</p>
<p>To be clear, the connection and ability to track what the user is doing is just on the screen in question, and it&#8217;s done with the user&#8217;s awareness of what is going on. In the demo of the service that I went through, it&#8217;s a very smooth service, which reminded me just a little of things like Clippy on Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Glia provides tools to agents to let coach them on questions to ask, phrasing to use, and links for answers, and Glia also develops virtual customer service assistants, to help with more basic questions. These also have the ability to interact with people&#8217;s screens when they make contact with a company. This in effect sees the company combining a number of technologies in one place, from natural language to suggest (and in some cases run) customer service responses, through to computer vision to help detect what is going on on the remote screen, through to more fundamental CRM technology to run those services across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>While screen sharing has been a well-used tool in other areas &#8212; for example in workforce collaboration environments, or for presenting online &#8212; Glia is seen as one of the pioneers in leveraging that for customer service. For investors, the interest in Glia has been to tap into that.</p>
<p>“We are proud to expand our investment in Glia as the company continues to lead the evolution of Digital Customer Service for businesses across the globe,” said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, in a statement. “Glia’s platform provides the modern technology necessary for businesses to meet customers in their digital journeys and communicate through the customer’s channel of choice. With this capital, the company will continue to scale and keep up with skyrocketing demand.”</p>
<p>We are in a key moment of digital transformation in customer services. Surprisingly, there are still many who opt for calling in to ask questions, but as Michaeli noted, these days, even when they are still using phones, customers will do so with &#8220;their screens in front of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown believes that this is the other opportunity to seize. “Many companies are still focused on moving antiquated, on-premises telephony systems to cloud contact centers that essentially offer the same functionality,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Instead, businesses can leapfrog this process and move directly to a digital-first cloud approach by partnering with Glia. If I were to build Interactive Intelligence for today’s contact center, I would take Glia’s approach.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic took hold in 2020, companies accelerated their move to cloud services. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lacework" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lacework">Lacework, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the cloud security startup, was in the right place at the right time as customers looked for ways to secure their cloud native workloads. The company reported that revenue grew 300% year over year for the second straight year.</p>
<p>It was rewarded for that kind of performance with a $525 million Series D today. It did not share an exact valuation, only saying that it exceeded $1 billion, which you would expect on such a hefty investment. Sutter Hill and Altimeter Capital led the round with help from D1 Capital Management, Coatue, Dragoneer Investment Group, Liberty Global Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snowflake-computing" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snowflake-computing">Snowflake <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ventures and Tiger Global Management. The company has now raised close to $600 million.</p>
<p>Lacework CEO Dan Hubbard says one of the reasons for such widespread interest from investors is the breadth of the company&#8217;s security solution. &#8220;We enable companies to build securely in the cloud, and we span across multiple different categories of markets, which enable the customers to do that,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that encompasses a range of services including configuration and compliance, security for infrastructure as code, build time and runtime vulnerability scanning and runtime security for cloud native environments like Kubernetes and containers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>As the company has grown revenue, it has been adding employees quickly. It started the year with 92 employees and closed with over 200 with plans to double that by the end of this year. As he looks at hiring, Hubbard is aware of the need to build a diverse organization, but acknowledges that tech in general hasn&#8217;t done a great job so far.</p>
<p>He says they are working with the various teams inside the company to try and change that, while also working to support outside organizations that are helping educate under represented groups to get the skills they need and then building from that. &#8220;If you can help solve the problem at an earlier stage, then I think you&#8217;ve got a bigger opportunity [to have a base of people to hire] there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was originally nurtured inside Sutter Hill and is built on top of the Snowflake platform. It reports that $20 million of today&#8217;s total comes from Snowflake&#8217;s new venture arm, which is putting some money into an early partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were an alpha Snowflake customer, and they were an alpha customer of ours. Our platform is built on top of the Snowflake data cloud and their new venture arm has also joined the round with an investment to further strengthen the partnership there,&#8221; Hubbard said.</p>
<p>As for Sutter Hill, investor Mike Speiser sees Lacework as one of his firm&#8217;s critical investments. &#8220;[Much] like Snowflake at a similar point in its evolution, Lacework is growing revenue at over 300% per year making Lacework one of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sutter-hill-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sutter-hill-ventures">Sutter Hill Ventures&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> most important and promising portfolio companies,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, a quickly-growing startup that sells a technology platform for hosting digital events, announced that it has acquired <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>. The acquired company, which bootstrapped itself to material revenue scale, will retain its brand and in-market product.</p>
<p>The deal is worth $250 million, paid in a mix of cash and stock. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hopin-8ff6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hopin-8ff6">Hopin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/hopin-raises-40m-series-a-as-its-virtual-events-business-accelerates/">raised a $40 million Series A in late June of 2020</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">a $125 million Series B last November</a> at a valuation of $2.125 billion.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>At the time of its most recent round, Hopin told TechCrunch that it had grown its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from zero to $20 million in around nine months. In an email Hopin told TechCrunch that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/streamyard" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="streamyard">StreamYard <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had itself scaled to $30 million ARR without external capital. And during a conversation regarding the StreamYard deal, Hopin CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyboufarhat?lang=en">Johnny Boufarhat</a> said that the combined entity would sport around $65 million in ARR.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can infer from the numbers that Hopin has continued to grow rapidly since its Series B.</p>
<p>If it feels strange that a Series B company is nearly at IPO-scale, recall that Hopin&#8217;s technology benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic during which events around the world from conference centers and into browsers, and that Series demarcations for startup funding rounds have lost their historical size, and maturity tethers. (TechCrunch used Hopin&#8217;s service to host several of its events in 2020.)</p>
<p>The deal will not subsume StreamYard whole-cloth into the Hopin product. Instead, StreamYard will retain its brand and product, so that it can continue to serve its existing customer base.  Hopin does intend to better integrate StreamYard&#8217;s streaming tech into his company&#8217;s marquee product, though its platform will remain streaming-provider agnostic; StreamYard will become the default Hopin streaming option, however.</p>
<p>StreamYard co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/geigev?lang=en">Geige Vandentop</a> told TechCrunch that around 15% to 20% of its customers use its service for events-related activities. The rest comes from sources like the creator economy, and small businesses.</p>
<p>As a company, StreamYard decided to eschew external capital during its growth, keeping its team nigh-skeletal while focusing on customer feedback to help it make product choices. Vandentop said in an interview that StreamYard will keep up its current cadence of weekly livestreams to solicit customer input while part of the Hopin product lineup.</p>
<p>On the same theme, Boufarhat told TechCrunch that Hopin is working to build a customer-first, multi-product lineup, of which StreamYard will be a key piece that the larger company will be known for.</p>
<p>Why would StreamYard sell to Hopin, if it had managed to scale to eight-figure ARR without requiring booster shots of external cash? Vandentop described the deal as best for his current customers, his team, adding that the tie-up should allow his startup to move more quickly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s read of the deal is that Hopin managed to roughly double its own size through the transaction that came at a relatively modest cost, when we contrast StreamYard&#8217;s revenue scale compared to the acquiring company&#8217;s own. However, StreamYard partially traded its equity for Hopin shares that, given the company&#8217;s rapid 2020 fundraising pace may indicate, could rapidly grow in value. And as Vandentop noted during our chat with the two executives, Hopin was growing even more quickly than his own startup.</p>
<p>The virtual events space, and the hybrid, online and offline events space that Hopin originally set out to serve before COVID-19, is one worth watching in 2021 as vaccines are deployed and the world looks forward to a future of safe travel. With StreamYard in its camp, however, any slowdown in the growth of virtual events software sales could be mitigated by streaming outfit&#8217;s largely distinct customer base.</p>
<p>Now we can begin a countdown of sorts for when the combined Hopin and StreamYard entity reaches $100 million in ARR. After that we&#8217;ll start the IPO timer.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>As an aside, Hopin paying around 10% of its current value for StreamYard puts the deal into a <a href="https://www.saastr.com/if-zuckerberg-offered-whatsapp-8-billion-instead-would-he-have-really-been-unable-to-close-that-deal/">similar bucket to the Facebook-WhatsApp deal</a>. A 10% deal implies that the acquiring company is making a material wager on the choice; the recent Slack-Salesforce deal was just over 10% of the acquiring company&#8217;s December market capitalization peak, for reference.</em></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/waymo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="waymo">Waymo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will no longer use the term &#8216;self-driving&#8217; to describe the technology it has been developing for more than a decade, opting instead for &#8216;autonomous.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Alphabet company said that this seemingly small shift is an important effort to clarify what the technology does and doesn&#8217;t do. It&#8217;s also been viewed as an attempt distance itself — and even the rest of the industry —from the &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; terminology that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> uses to describe its advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This past year, we explored the importance of language and how terms like “self-driving car” inaccurately describe what autonomous driving companies, like Waymo, are building,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.ltad.com/news/weve-changed-our-name-heres-why.html">company wrote in a blog post Wednesday</a>. &#8220;Waymo’s vehicles don&#8217;t drive themselves. Rather, Waymo is automating the task of driving and thus the term &#8220;autonomous driving&#8221; is more accurate. The conflation of terms used to describe vastly different technology &#8212; such as advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving technology &#8212; is referred to as and has serious implications for road safety. find people consistently overestimate the capabilities of driver-assisted features.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Waymo&#8217;s decision to drop the self-driving term has been viewed by other AV companies as a call to action by the entire industry. But not everyone in the industry on board.</p>
<p>Several industry insiders and founders that TechCrunch spoke to wondered if a push to drop &#8220;self-driving&#8221; might have the unintended effect of ceding the term to Tesla. Others suggested efforts would be better spent on other means of education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re pursuing a driverless application of this technology, and will continue to educate the public on its benefits with language that makes a clear distinction between technologies that drive a truck or car as opposed to technologies that assist a driver,&#8221; Aurora CEO Chris Urmson said. &#8220;Rather than rename technology based on misleading marketing efforts of other companies, we agree it is important as an industry to align on clear language to define the life-saving technology we’re building.&#8221;</p>
<p>The push back on Waymo is in part an acknowledgement of the company&#8217;s position in the industry. Waymo, the former Google self-driving project, is one of the leaders in the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Its efforts carry weight and influence in a nascent industry.</p>
<p>Waymo, which changed the name of its education campaign from Let&#8217;s Talk About Self-Driving to Let&#8217;s Talk About Autonomous Driving as part of its announcement, argues that automakers have described or marketed the advanced driver assistance systems in personally owned vehicles as self-driving or semi-autonomous. That, the company says, is creating confusion. Waymo never names Tesla as one of the drivers behind this name change. However, Tesla and its use of the terms Autopilot and FSD has prompted criticism from an array of automotive and safety organizations as well as autonomous vehicle companies.</p>
<p>Waymo points to research that has found that human drivers operating cars, trucks and SUVs that have been marketed as self-driving don&#8217;t understand the limited capabilities of the technology, which can lead to misuse. The company cited one study conducted in 2019, in which half of respondents believed a driver-assist feature allowed them to drive hands-free, even though these systems require drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Questions and confusion around how to describe technology that allows a vehicle to operate on its own without a human driver behind the wheel have persisted for years. Terms like autonomous, automated driving, driverless and self-driving have been used interchangeably for a decade, some fading off for a time before popping back up in popularity. Fully autonomous driving is another more recent entrant in the sphere of AV linguistics. Even Waymo uses the term autonomous and &#8220;fully autonomous&#8221; at different times within its blog post announcing its decision to drop the self-driving term.</p>
<p>&#8216;Self-driving&#8217; has been the go-to term for companies dedicated to developing and commercializing autonomous vehicle technology. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/argo-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="argo-ai">Argo AI, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Aurora, Cruise, Motional, Nuro and Voyage — other leading companies in the industry — use the term &#8216;self-driving&#8217; on their websites to describe what they&#8217;re doing. Zoox is perhaps the one outlier that uses autonomous ride-hailing.</p>
<p>Other companies such as Argo AI are taking a different approach, opting for a storyteller or learn through conversation strategy. Argo AI, which is backed by Ford and VW, launched a podcast in November 2019 and has published about three dozen episodes to date. The company has expanded that effort with the launch of <a href="https://groundtruthautonomy.com/">Ground Truth</a>, which Argo describes as a &#8220;storytelling platform that provides an inside look at the development of autonomous driving technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since there&#8217;s no shortage of hype and speculation about self-driving cars, there is a need for a place where people can get a realistic understanding of this revolutionary technology and how it could one day impact their lives,&#8221; Argo AI co-founder and CEO <span class="xn-person">Bryan Salesky said in a statement about the new platform. </span>&#8220;Ground Truth will be a destination for stories not just about the technology, but about the people doing the work, the cities where it will be deployed, and the businesses it can enable.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks, incumbent banks, and all of the many businesses that are making inroads into any kind of banking service all have something in common: when it comes to launching a new product like a credit line or a deposit or current account, these days many of them are opting not to build from the ground up, but are instead using third-party technology to power these services. Today, one of the big players in providing that tech is announcing a large round of funding to expand its business, underscoring the growth in this market.</p>
<p><a href="http://mambu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a>, a Berlin-based startup that describes itself as an SaaS banking platform &#8212; providing, by way of APIs, technology to banks and others to power lending, deposit and other banking products &#8212; has closed a round of €110 million (about $135 million at today&#8217;s rates). The funding gives Mambu a post-money valuation of €1.7 billion (just over $2 billion at today&#8217;s rates), the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eugene Danilkis said it will be using the money to expand deeper in the 50 markets where it is already active, as well as focus more on specific regions like South America and Asia. (And for those keeping tabs on the &#8220;Is the Bay Area dead?&#8221; story, it&#8217;s one of the many tech companies with its US offices established in Miami.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mambu has been seeing 100% growth year-on-year, but notably, Mambu covered 50 markets when it last raised money, <a href="http://www.eu-startups.com/2019/02/mambu-raises-e30million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€30 million in 2019</a>, so you can argue it has some investing and expanding to do on that front.</p>
<p>The round is being led by TCV, with Tiger Global and Arena Holdings, along with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital and Acton Capital Partners, also participating. TCV, known for making big growth round bets (it&#8217;s invested in the likes of Netflix, Facebook and Spotify in the past) has also been carving out a name for itself for backing some of the biggest names in European fintech and e-commerce, with recent investments including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolut</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mollie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relex</a>.</p>
<p>The market that Mambu is courting is the vast opportunity for a new wave of banking and financial services that tap into the growth of smartphone and web usage.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where people have to go into physical banks to take out or deposit money, or fill out loan applications and meet with assessors who ultimately decide whether you or your business will get money or not. In fact, many of those brick-and-mortar locations don&#8217;t even exist anymore. In their place are apps, websites, and on-demand services that live wherever people are spending time and money online.</p>
<p>Mambu&#8217;s platform, according to Danilkis, covers some 7,000 different banking products at the moment. These are roughly split across three primary categories: lending, current accounts and deposit accounts, but the sheer number of products really speaks to just how many ways and forms in which you are offered banking services today. (Take credit for example: you can get it through various kinds of cards, point of sale pay-later products, straight loans, and so on.) Alongside its own products, it also provides links through to <a href="https://www.mambu.com/post/transferwise-for-banks-integrates-with-mambu-cloud-banking-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain third-party financial services like TransferWise</a>, additional services such as security (perhaps a given for a banking platform) and a platform for &#8220;process orchestration&#8221; (its equivalent of providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business process management</a> tools).</p>
<p>Gartner estimates (cited by Mambu) put the banking software market at over $100 billion and growing at double-digits, and Mambu&#8217;s customer list reveals the range of companies that are vying these days for a piece of that action: they include the likes of challenger banks like N26 and OakNorth, but also large incumbent banks like Santander and ABN Amro, and telecoms carriers like Orange, which together cover some 20 million customers and some $12 billion under management, Mambu said.</p>
<p>And indeed, the bigger opportunity has also meant that companies like Mambu have a large and growing list of competitors too: they include newer companies like Rapyd and Unit, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a>, which raised a big round last year; <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a> and Italy’s <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a>. It will be interesting to see how newer entrants in the SaaS banking-platform space disrupt what are, effectively, becoming incumbents in their own right: Mambu is now approaching 10 years old (it was founded in 2011). That could lead to consolidation, too.</p>
<p>Turning back to that customer list, I can understand the logic of a company not really in the business of financial services like a telco, or a neo-bank taking an API-based service to power banking &#8212; it focuses instead on building clever algorithms for running those services, and fast interfaces to make them easy to use &#8212; it was interesting to me to see large banks on that list, too. It turns out that the reason is because banks are up against it in another way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, banks have the functionality and capability, but launching something new is often a case of speed and cost,&#8221; said Danilkis. &#8220;The banks might have a generation-2 system but many will be much older. And  changing how a financial product behaves is very difficult and highly risky because even a small change can create problems. And those systems are not designed to work with APIs, so it is extremely hard if not impossible to connect to other systems, never mind in real time. Certain solutions or offerings become impossible or impractical to build yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Doran, the TCV partner, is joining Mambu&#8217;s board with this round, and while the company may be seen as an incumbent to some, its early mover position has helped it not only gain market share, but to stand out for investors as one of the players with staying power.</p>
<p>“Mambu was one of the first companies to leverage the opportunity to move banking software into the cloud,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;The team has built a highly composable, truly cloud-native product in a multi-billion dollar, rapidly-growing market traditionally dominated by large, slow-moving on-prem vendors. We have been following Mambu’s progress for many years and are truly delighted to be able to partner with Eugene and the entire Mambu team on their journey to expand their offerings to customers worldwide.”</p>
<p>EDIT: An earlier version of this article misstated the amount raised as €100 million. It is actually €110 million (the valuation is correct).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital services taxes adopted by India, Italy, and Turkey in the past years discriminate against U.S. companies, the U.S. Trade Representative said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>USTR, which began investigations into the three nation’s digital services taxes in June last year, said it found them to be inconsistent with international tax principles, unreasonable, and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.</p>
<p>In its detailed reports, which the office has <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">made public</a>, USTR studied how these digital taxes affected companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, and Twitter. USTR said it conducted these investigations on the ground of Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India, which has become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">largest market for Silicon Valley giants</a> Google and Facebook, introduced digital taxes in 2016 to target foreign firms. Last year, the world’s second largest internet market expanded the scope of its levy to cover a range of additional categories.</p>
<p>USTR investigation <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Report%20on%20India%E2%80%99s%20Digital%20Services%20Tax.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that New Delhi was taxing “numerous categories of digital services that are not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world” and that the aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year.  It also took issue with India not levying similar taxes on local companies.</p>
<p>Despite the strong findings on three nations’ digital services taxes, USTR said it is not taking any specific actions “at this time” but will “continue to evaluate all available options.”</p>
<p>U.S. tech companies have in the past supported terms brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But OECD, which is currently in the middle of working out technical details for agreements for over a 100 nations, doesn’t expect to finish the work until mid-2021. In the absence of OECD agreements, various countries are moving forward with their own versions of the taxes.</p>
<p>Since June last year, USTR has initiated investigations into digital services tax instituted &#8212; or proposed to be put in place &#8211; by a number of countries including Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and France, which resumed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/">collecting digital services tax from US companies</a> late last year.</p>
<p>In retaliation, USTR had set a January 6 deadline for levying a 25% tariff on a range of French imported goods including cosmetics and handbags.</p>
<p>USTR did not say whether the tariff had been enforced, but in a <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">statement</a> said it expects to announce the progress or completion of additional investigations in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://toogoodtogo.com">Too Good To Go</a>, the startup that lets you buy food right before it goes to waste, is raising a $31.1 million round. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blisce">blisce/</a> is leading the round and investing $15.4 million as part of today’s round. Existing investors and employees are also participating. While the company has been around for a while, this is the first time Too Good To Go is raising money from a VC firm.</p>
<p>The startup has been operating across several European countries for a few years now. It runs a marketplace focused on food waste. On one side, restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries and other food businesses contribute surplus food items. On the other side, consumers can snatch food right before it becomes unsellable.</p>
<p>It’s a win for everybody as businesses can generate a bit of revenue from surplus food, customers can buy food at great prices and it reduces unnecessary waste. Of course, it’s also beneficial for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/too-good-to-go-c930" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="too-good-to-go-c930">Too Good To Go <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the company takes a commission on transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s CEO Mette Lykke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/mette-lykke-on-food-waste-and-building-a-big-startup-on-a-big-idea/">told</a> TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden that one-third of food produced today is either lost or wasted — so there’s a big market opportunity. While the startup has been growing nicely, the pandemic has had a big impact on revenue — many restaurants shut down and many customers prefer to stay at home.</p>
<p>Back in September, Lykke told TechCrunch that Too Good To Go saw a 62% drop in revenue due to Covid-19. But that’s not going to stop the company.</p>
<p>Overall, Too Good To Go is operating in 15 countries and has saved 50 million meals. 65,000 businesses have sold something on Too Good To Go so far. 30 million people signed up to the service.</p>

<p>Too Good To Go is already working on its biggest expansion — the U.S. Just like in Europe, billions of pounds of food go to waste. According to <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">USDA’s Economic Research Service</a>, it represents 30 to 40% of the food supply.</p>
<p>As the startup’s operations are extremely local, Too Good To Go is starting with specific metropolitan areas in the U.S. In September, the company started its operations in the U.S. with New York City and Boston. Too Good To Go has expanded to part of New Jersey since then.</p>
<p>In the U.S. alone, the startup has attracted 150,000 users and is working with 600 businesses. It has sold 50,000 meals. Those numbers are still somewhat small, but it’s been a weird quarter for restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it evolves in the coming months. With today’s new funding round, it should definitely boost usage in the U.S. and make it easier to plan for the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.pennylane.tech">Pennylane</a> has raised $18.4 million (€15 million) for its accounting service that combines automated processes with human accountants. Existing investors Global Founders Capital and Partech are investing once again.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pennylane" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pennylane">Pennylane <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is both a software-as-a-service company that helps you deal with your financial data and an accounting firm. By working with accountants directly, it means that you can talk with your accountant through the company’s platform. It becomes a single source of information for financial data.</p>
<p>The startup wants to improve the experience for both its clients and its accountants. Usually, accounting firms receive data every month or every quarter. They waste a ton of time opening files and entering information in accounting software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, accounting reports are a black box for CEOs and CFOs. They can’t leverage that data for financial projections and visibility. Pennylane wants to change that so that you don’t have to use Excel to predict your company’s P&amp;L.</p>
<p>When you first start working with Pennylane, you connect your account with third-party services that already hold valuable information, such as Stripe, Payfit, Qonto, Zoho, Sellsy, etc. This way, information is always up to date, and not just when you manually export data from all your services.</p>
<p>A year after launch, Pennylane has generated €2 million in revenue ($2.5 million) and attracted 550 customers. There are now 30 accountants working for the company.</p>
<p>Up next, the startup wants to attract more companies, and especially companies that have an in-house accounting team or work with an accounting firm already. You&#8217;ll be able to use Pennylane&#8217;s software-as-a-service with your own accountant.</p>
<p>Pennylane had previously raised a $4.3 million (€4 million) seed round with Global Founders Capital, Partech and Kima Ventures.</p>

<p>Leading the round is by JOIN Capital, and Spintop Ventures, with participation from existing pre-seed backer Icebreaker VC. It brings the total raised by the 2018-founded company to €2.35 million.</p>
<p>Co-founded by CEO Sakari Arvela, who has 15 years experience as a patent attorney, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iprally" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iprally">IPRally <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has built a knowledge graph to help machines better understand the technical details of patents and to enable humans to more efficiently trawl through existing patients. The premise is that a graph-based approach is more suited to patent search than simple keywords or freeform text search.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because, argues Arvela, every patent publication can be distilled down to a simpler knowledge graph that &#8220;resonates&#8221; with the way IP professionals think and is infinitely more machine readable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded IPRally in April 2018, after one year of bootstrapping and proof-of-concepting with my co-founder and CTO Juho Kallio,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Before that, I had digested the graph approach myself for about two years and collected the courage to start the venture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arvela says patent search is a hard problem to solve since it involves both deep understanding of technology and the capability to compare different technologies in detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why this has been done almost entirely manually for as long as the patent system has existed. Even the most recent out-of-the-box machine learning models are way too inaccurate to solve the problem. This is why we have developed a specific ML model for the patent domain that reflects the way human professionals approach the search task and make the problem sensible for the computers too&#8221;.</p>
<p>That approach appears to be paying off, with IPRally already being used by customers such as Spotify and ABB, as well as intellectual property offices. Target customers are described as any corporation that actively protects its own R&amp;D with patents and has to navigate the IPR landscape of competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IPRally is not without its own competition. Arvela cites industry giants like Clarivate and Questel that dominate the market with traditional keyword search engines.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a few other AI-based startups, like Amplified and IPScreener. &#8220;IPRally’s graph approach makes the searches much more accurate, allows detail-level computer analysis, and offer a non-black-box solution that is explainable for and controllable by the user,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat locked President Donald Trump’s account after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol</a>. A Snap spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the action was taken on Wednesday and added that the company will monitor the situation closely before re-evaluating its decision.</p>
<p>This is not the first time <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken action against Trump’s account over concerns about dangerous rhetoric from the president. In June, it announced content from Trump’s Snapchat would no longer be promoted in its Discover tab, and would only be visible to users if they subscribe to or search for it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/we-stand-together">blog post</a> published shortly before Snap announced its decision, co-founder and chief executive officer Evan Spiegel said that Snapchat &#8220;simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/">Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/embed/#?secret=CeDEyE2k7l" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike many other social media platforms, Snapchat was created for users to communicate with friends instead of a wider audience, the Snap spokesperson said. It has focused on making it harder to spread misinformation by relying on moderated and vetted content. For example, the Discover tab only features content from editorial partners like Reuters and other news organizations.</p>
<p>Twitter also locked Trump out of his account after forcing the removal of three tweets, but that action may <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">last for only twelve hours</a>. Facebook and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">locked Trump out of posting for 24 hours</a> and blocked the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>
<p>Many activists are calling for Twitter and Facebook to make their bans permanent, with ethics organization Accountable Tech <a href="https://twitter.com/accountabletech/status/1346938971172073473">tweeting</a> that &#8220;the violent assault on the Capitol today has been heartbreaking, but not entirely unexpected. Sadly, Twitter and Facebook’s preparedness and response has been wildly inadequate. Simply labeling incitements of violence is not enough.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The State Department ordered diplomats to stop posting on social media after pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/state-dept-social-media-silence/index.html">reports CNN</a>, citing three diplomatic sources. Diplomats overseas were also told by the under secretary for public affairs to remove scheduled content for Facebook, Hootsuite and Twitter until told otherwise, and that planned social media posts from the State Department’s main accounts were also being suspended.</p>
<p>According to CNN, diplomats are usually only told to pause social media posts after a terrorist attack or major natural disaster.</p>
<p>As of late Wednesday evening in the United States, the main <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept">State Department Twitter account </a>had only retweeted a thread by Secretary of State MIchael Pompeo in which he said &#8220;the storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>So far, the official Instagram accounts of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">State Department’s Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">Pompeo</a> and the State Department’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo">YouTube</a> have made no posts after the rioting at the Capitol, while the State Department&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/statedept/posts/10157789477951074">Facebook page</a> has a post repeating Pompeo’s Twitter thread.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has contacted the State Department for comment.</p>
<p>Social media platforms scrambled to react after an extraordinary and terrifying <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html">day of violence that resulted in the deaths of four people</a>. Rioters breached the Capitol early Wednesday afternoon, as electoral votes were being counted, forcing lawmakers to evacuate (the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote">joint session was later reconvened</a>).</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Twitter required the removal of three of President Donald Trump’s tweets and locked his account for twelve hours, before stating that he would be permanently suspended for future violations of its Civic Integrity policy. Facebook and Instagram announced that the president would barred from posting to his accounts for 24 hours and began blocking content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was hard not to feel emotional today, as the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/social-media-allowed-a-shocked-nation-watch-a-coup-attempt-in-real-time/">watched for more than four hours</a> as rioters stormed into and throughout the Capitol building in Washington to disrupt the certification of the election win of incoming U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden. They&#8217;d been encouraged earlier in the afternoon by outgoing President Donald Trump to head to the building and protest what he falsely claimed yet again was a stolen election, a lie he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ESXL7J6DY">began to spread</a> the evening of the U.S. election in November.</p>
<p>While members of Congress called on Trump to make a statement rebuking the rioters&#8217; actions from their undisclosed locations, he instead encouraged his supporters over Twitter, writing of the &#8220;sacred landslide election victory&#8221; that was &#8220;so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots&#8221; and later posting a video in which repeated his lies about a &#8220;landslide election that was stolen from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/mayhem-erupts-in-the-u-s-capitol-as-congress-certifies-electoral-votes">first time in American history</a> that supporters of the losing presidential candidate forcibly disrupted the official counting of electoral votes, as noted earlier in the evening by PBS. And while Trump&#8217;s tweets were <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/twittersafety/status/1346970430062485505">later deleted</a> by Twitter for &#8220;repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,&#8221; the move was viewed by many as <a href="https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/1346971654484680707?s=20">too little and too late</a>, including by Silicon Valley investors, a wide number of whom let loose their fury toward the outgoing administration and its enablers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
A lingering question is whether the ignominious day &#8212; one on which a dozen Senate Republicans and dozens more Republican House members had planned to object to the certification of the election results &#8212; will begin to polarize people further or whether, following Trump&#8217;s departure, some of that fury begins to subside instead.</p>
<p>Some investors, at least, say their anger has always had more to do with basic human decency, which seemed frequently to take a backseat during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Deena Shakir of Lux Capital used to work for the Obama administration and is transparent about her political perspective on Twitter. But she says of today&#8217;s events that they &#8220;are not about politics. What we have witnessed is an affront to democracy, an assault on American history, and a gruesome reflection of the divided nation we live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hunter Walk &#8212; who cofounded the venture firm Homebrew and today tweeted, &#8220;don&#8217;t be putting [Trump son-in-law and White House advisor] Jared Kushner on cap tables <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1346923275637571592">when this is all said and done</a>&#8221; &#8212; echoes the sentiment. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to have a strong public voice on issues I consider to be urgent and essential human rights questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether the shock of today might make it harder to fund or partner with a team who supported Trump&#8217;s ascendency, Walk suggests it won&#8217;t, that business is business. &#8220;We fund wonderful entrepreneurs and employ no purity tests on whether they agree with us 100%. I&#8217;m certain we&#8217;ve backed people who sit to our political left and to our political right &#8211; that&#8217;s not an issue for us and not an issue for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the extent that Walk&#8217;s public political stance may turn off some talented founders who &#8220;would just prefer their investors shut up and write checks,&#8221; that&#8217;s &#8220;ok,&#8221; too, says Walk. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe we need to compromise our values in order to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shakir meanwhile suggests that she doesn&#8217;t always have the luxury of tuning out politics entirely. For one thing, she considers those who terrorized the nation&#8217;s capital all afternoon &#8220;angered perpetrators of a jingoistic, supremacist ideology that is not only normalized but actually incited by the highest branch of our government and amplified via social media.&#8221;</p>
<p>More, she notes, &#8220;Given my focus on healthcare, so much of my own thesis development and so many of my conversations have inevitably been informed by the pandemic, which—for better or worse—has become politicized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try as she might to bifurcate politics from work, it&#8217;s futile right now, Shakir says. &#8220;These events and policies inform our present and our future, affect the markets that value our companies, and contribute to trends and white spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, she adds, they also &#8220;reflect our values as a nation and as human beings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eat Just, a food startup from San Francisco making chicken-less eggs, has ambitions to crack the Chinese market where consumer appetite for plant-based food is growing and other Western vegan substitute brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">Beyond became available</a> in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The startup said this week it will be suppling to fast-food chain Dicos, a local rival to McDonald&#8217;s and KFC in China. The agreement will see Eat Just add its plant-based eggs to the restaurant&#8217;s breakfast items across more than 500 locations. The eggs are derived from a legume called mung beans, which have long been a popular ingredient for soup, noodles and dessert in China.</p>
<p>At Dicos in major Chinese cities, consumers will find Eat Just eggs in breakfast burgers, bagel sandwiches and Western-style breakfast plates. That diversifies the Dicos plant-based menu which already includes <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006329/dicos%2C-chinas-rival-to-kfc%2C-unveils-imitation-chicken-burgers">a vegan chicken burger</a> supplied by local startup Starfield. Dicos also offers a gateway into China&#8217;s low-tier cities where it has built a stronghold and can potentially help evangelize plant-based proteins in communities beyond China&#8217;s urban yuppies. The chain operates a total of 2,600 stores in China and serves 600 million customers a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eat Just first entered China in 2019 and currently generates less than 5% of its revenue from the country, Andrew Noyes, head of global communications at Eat Just, told TechCrunch. But over time, the company expects China to account for more than half of its revenue. Ten of its 160 employees are based in China.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been intentional about starting small, going slow and hiring people who know the market and understand how to build a sustainable business there. We&#8217;ve also been focused on finding the right partners to work with on downstream manufacturing, sales and distribution, and that work continues,&#8221; said Noyes.</p>
<p>The partnership with Dicos arrived on the heels of Eat Just&#8217;s announcement to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/eat-just-partners-with-proterra-to-launch-a-new-subsidiary-in-asia/"> set up an Asia subsidiary</a>. The nine-year-old company, formerly Hampton Creek, has raised over $300 million from prominent investors including Li Ka-Shing, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures. It was last valued at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Before its tie-up with Dicos, Eat Just had already been selling online in China through Alibaba and JD.com among other retail channels. Its China business is currently growing by 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no shortage of strong competition in the plant-based food race in China, Eat Just claims it&#8217;s taken a unique angle by zeroing in on eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based meat companies offer products that pair deliciously with Just Egg,&#8221; the brand name of the startup&#8217;s main product, Noyes noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based foods are increasing in popularity among Chinese consumers and more sustainable eating is becoming part of a national dialogue about the feeding of the country in the future. China produces about 435 billion eggs per year and demand for protein is increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Euromonitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">predicted</a> that China, the world&#8217;s largest meat-consuming country, would see its &#8220;free from meat&#8221; market size grow to $12 billion by 2023, compared to $10 billion in 2018.</p>
