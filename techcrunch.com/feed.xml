</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the war for talent, equity compensation has become more important than ever, but it’s not the easiest concept to explain, especially in privately funded companies.</p>
<p>Equity isn’t a new concept. Public and private companies have been using stock options (or RSUs) to recruit, motivate and retain talent for decades. However, equity compensation has grown in importance when it comes to hiring, retaining and aligning incentives across all employees, not just senior executives.</p>
<p>This is happening for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A global shortage of skilled tech workers:</strong> Candidates with in-demand skills are now getting multiple offers and can practically name their price. That price, more often than not these days, includes some kind of equity component.</li>
<li><strong>Wage inflation:</strong> The labor shortage and market dynamics are causing significant wage inflation. Companies are looking for ways to increase total compensation while reserving cash. Equity is one way to do this.</li>
<li><strong>A growing focus on private valuations:</strong> The number of companies reaching unicorn status is increasing. According to CB Insights, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 900 companies globally have achieved unicorn status</a>, and 2021 alone minted more than 450 unicorns, up from the previous high-water mark of 111 in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency around compensation:</strong> Compensation data is accessible. Historically, companies like Glassdoor have provided robust salary data for more mature organizations. Now, companies like AngelList provide both <a href="https://angel.co/salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salary and equity benchmarking for startups</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Expectations:</strong> More than half (53%) of millennials say <a href="https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schwab_equity_compensation_survey2020_findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equity compensation was the main reason</a> or one of the main reasons they took their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders need to get better at understanding and articulating not just why equity is important but also how it’s determined. So let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>An ownership mentality is good for both business and morale, which is why many founders choose to allocate some level of equity (even a small piece) beyond leadership roles. Leaders may have the vision, but they need a team to execute and concretize their ideas.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Think strategically, think ahead, and communicate — make sure you’re offering the right equity allocation, for the right strategic reasons, and to achieve the right goals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Designing your equity program</h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided stock options are going to be a component of <a href="https://tercera.io/resources/total-rewards-for-the-remote-workforce/">your total rewards package</a>, it’s time to define your philosophy and design your equity program.</p>
<h3>Sizing the equity pool</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to determine the size of your employee option pool. You will want to formulate your thoughts prior to discussions with investors, who may require the creation of a larger option pool than is necessary if your proposed pool is disconnected from your hiring plan.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.backmarket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Market</a> has raised another mega round of funding. In May, the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">$335 million Series D round</a>. Today, the company is announcing a $510 million Series E round, which values the company at $5.7 billion.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Back Market, the company operates a marketplace of refurbished electronics devices — mostly smartphones. In other words, if you think smartphones are expensive, you can get a phone that is still in good condition without paying full price.</p>
<p>There are many reasons consumers might buy a phone on Back Market instead of buying a new phone from a carrier or smartphone manufacturer. In addition to saving money, many customers think new phones only feature incremental updates compared to previous generation models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Many customers also want to avoid generating additional waste and choose a used device for that reason. Many old smartphones simply end up in a drawer after all. A new battery and sometimes a new display might be enough to turn an old device into an attractive refurbished phone.</p>
<p>Back Market doesn’t refurbish devices directly. Instead, third-party companies act as the sourcing partners for Back Market. By listing their inventory on Back Market’s marketplace, they can find customers more easily.</p>
<p>On the other end of the transaction, customers buy devices through Back Market, as there’s a 30-day money-back guarantee. Overall, 6 million customers have purchased a device on Back Market.</p>
<p>Sprints Capital is leading today’s funding round, with existing investors also participating, such as Eurazeo, Aglaé Ventures, General Atlantic and Generation Investment Management. The French tech ecosystem has been on a roll as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">PayFit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a> also announced that they had raised hundreds of millions of euros each over the last few days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to make refurbished electronics the first choice for tech purchases. We expect to see a similar development in the electronics market as we have witnessed in the pre-owned car market in America, where consumer confidence in buying second-hand vehicles has resulted in sales that have increased twofold compared to new car sales,” co-founder and CEO Thibaud Hug de Larauze said in a statement. “The support and confidence of these funds, together with our growing customer base, marks an important step in Back Market’s journey, and more importantly, for the circular economy as a whole.”</p>
<p>One metric that is particularly important for Back Market is the average failure rate. Right now, the company estimates that it has a failure rate of about 4%, which means that one in every 25 phones doesn’t work as expected in one way or another. That’s why customer service is key when it comes to customer satisfaction. The company also estimates that new devices have a 3% failure rate.</p>
<p>The startup expects to double in size with a specific focus on the U.S. market — it currently has 650 employees. Back Market operates in 16 countries, including many European markets, the U.S. and Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monica Sarbu, co-founder and CEO at <a href="http://Xata.io">Xata.io</a>, has more than 15 years of experience working at tech companies. She never had a mentor to help her navigate her way inside the organizations where she worked, but she saw how some women and other historically underrepresented people struggled to find their way. She began thinking about how she could help more people succeed inside tech companies, and after much thought, she formed a nonprofit mentoring company in 2020 called <a href="http://tupu.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tupu.io</a> as a side project.</p>
<p>She initially considered writing a book, but she concluded that there is really no one-size-fits-all advice and it would need to be tailored to the individual&#8217;s situation. &#8220;I had this idea to build a mentorship program that would give [people] a custom solution designed for their own needs because most of the time, people come to you for mentorship in general when they have a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She sees these problems usually falling into one of two categories: They either have a specific issue with someone in the company or they feel stuck in their careers and have grown depressed or fallen victim to imposter syndrome. She felt a program like Tupu could help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to career site <a href="https://www.zippia.com/software-engineer-jobs/demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zippia.com</a>, just 25% of engineering jobs go to women. That means they are on average outnumbered 3:1, and it&#8217;s often worse than that. That can sometimes lead to a hostile work environment, whether that&#8217;s intentional or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many things that we can do to advise technical content companies to be better and create a more healthy environment because, in the end, this is what kind of makes you feel like you don&#8217;t want to be part of a tech company anymore. It&#8217;s the culture of the company,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, she has spoken at conferences, first primarily focused on women, and then later more general events, trying to articulate what it was like to be a woman inside an organization with mostly men. Through her speaking engagements, she was able to raise awareness and even empathy even among the mostly male audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began the talk by asking them to try to put [themselves] in the shoes of a woman for a second [inside a tech company dominated by men] and then I tried to build a picture around this about what it feels like,&#8221; Sarbu told me.</p>
<p>She received a lot of positive feedback from men who hadn&#8217;t understood what it&#8217;s like to be one of a few women on technical teams. At that point, she wanted to do something more, and<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the idea for Tupu began to form in her head.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hQjWZbvRGW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/all-raise-taps-stitch-fixs-katrina-lake-and-others-to-mentor-female-founders/">All Raise taps Stitch Fix&#8217;s Katrina Lake and others to mentor female founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;All Raise taps Stitch Fix&#8217;s Katrina Lake and others to mentor female founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/all-raise-taps-stitch-fixs-katrina-lake-and-others-to-mentor-female-founders/embed/#?secret=hQjWZbvRGW" data-secret="hQjWZbvRGW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>She said that most programs like this charge by the mentee, and this usually limits the number of people who could be involved to the most promising employees, who in her experience have the least need. Her idea was to do this for free, putting in her own money initially while asking for donations from companies to help support the program and match more mentors with folks who need them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our model going forward is to go to tech companies of all sizes and help them with supporting diversity in their organization by offering mentorship to their employees,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The companies are not forced to choose the most &#8216;promising&#8217; employees to sign up for a mentorship program (as is happening at the moment) and they are able to encourage everyone to sign up for Tupu.io, whether mentees and mentors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program currently has 57 mentees for 128 mentors. The mentors are men and women who have experience working in tech companies. She said that the platform has been able to attract these users to this point with little or no publicity or advertising.</p>
<p>Sarbu, whose day job is running Xata.io, a startup building a serverless database for the Jamstack environment, wants to make the site self-sufficient through donations from participating companies while making the process of signing up and matching mentors with mentees more automated. The company is working on a more automated version of the site and expects it to be ready soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new social app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Locket</a>, popped to the top of the App Store charts in recent days thanks to its clever premise to put live photos from friends in a widget on your iOS homescreen. In other words, it turns Apple&#8217;s widget system &#8212; typically used to showcase information like news, weather, inspirational quotes or photos from your own iPhone&#8217;s gallery &#8212; into a private social networking platform.</p>
<p>The idea for the app was dreamed up by Matt Moss, a former Apple Worldwide Developer Conference student scholarship winner and recent UC Santa Barbara grad, who had been building a user research and testing platform called <a href="https://www.usehawkeye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawkeye Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Locket, he admits, was originally a personal side project &#8212; not his main focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I built it as a present for my girlfriend for her birthday last summer,&#8221; Moss explains. &#8220;She was going back to school in the fall, so we were about to start a long-distance relationship,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The process of getting a little photo from her on my homescreen&#8230;seemed really appealing. Just a nice way to stay in touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The developer build the app over a week or two and ended up using it with his girlfriend fairly extensively over the past six months, sending each other an average of five photos per day. As Locket also stores the photos sent and received in its history section, the app became a fun way to look back on their photos, as well.</p>
<p>Soon, the couple&#8217;s friends started taking notice and asked if they could use it with their own significant others, family or friends. So Moss decided to make Locket publicly available to users on the App Store.</p>
<p>The app launched on New Year&#8217;s Day, and has now seen more than 2 million users sign up as of this morning. On Sunday, Lokcet became the No. 1 app overall on the U.S. App Store, per <a href="https://apptopia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia&#8217;s</a> app store data, and had become the No. 1 Social Networking app the day prior. Apptopia reports only seeing around 1 million global installs so far, with about 31% from the U.S. &#8212; but its data is only through yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moss credits Locket&#8217;s rapid adoption to going viral on TikTok, where he published videos to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@locketcamera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an accompanying company account</a> for Locket where he could show off the app in action. His video received some 100,000 views over just a couple of days. Other TikTok users then began making their own content featuring the app and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7047999931373652783" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the custom sound used</a> on the original Locket video.</p>

<p>This helped blow up the app even more among TikTok&#8217;s young user base. In fact, one video made by a TikTok user in the U.K. topped 5 million views in a single day, Moss noted.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for app developers to leverage TikTok to drive installs at the time of launch, Moss denies that any sort of paid influencer marketing took place here, nor did he run paid advertisements on TikTok or elsewhere, he says.</p>
<p>Today, Locket remains in the No. 1 position on the iPhone&#8217;s Top Free Apps chart as a result of its TikTok exposure &#8212; and because its early adopters invited their friends to download the app and check it out, driving further installs.</p>
<p>To get started using the app, download Locket from the App Store and sign up by verifying your phone number.</p>
<p>Locket then requests access to your iPhone&#8217;s Contacts and Camera in order to function. Ideally, Locket would allow users to bypass full address book access to instead allow users to invite friends through standalone invitations, as that would be a more privacy-focused approach. Moss tells us he&#8217;s considering changing this aspect of the app&#8217;s behavior, which is meant to make the app easier to use. However, he says Locket doesn&#8217;t store your contact info nor send its invites automatically using its own phone number &#8212; it just pops up the iMessage window so you can customize the text sent to your friends.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to decline Apple&#8217;s pop-up, which requests permission to pull in your Contacts, you aren&#8217;t able to use the app at all, we found.</p>
<p>After inviting and adding friends to join you on Locket, you&#8217;ll then add the app&#8217;s widget to your iOS home screen. The widget will showcase your friends&#8217; photos as they add images throughout the day. You can also launch the app at any time to add photos of your own to be sent to your friends&#8217; widgets.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much more to the app than that, really. There are no fancy camera filters or effects, nor can you upload images from your Camera Roll. The experience is designed to be a way to share photos in real time with a small group of up to five friends or loved ones.</p>
<p>Locket&#8217;s quick shot to the top of the App Store has Moss now thinking of his next steps. He plans to later introduce a subscription model and support for additional widgets and, at some point, an Android version. As to whether or not he&#8217;ll take on outside investment, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely thinking about stuff,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the creator believes there&#8217;s potential in Locket beyond its current photo widget experience &#8212; perhaps even growing out a set of features inside the app as users share more photos over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is something pretty meaningful to be built in the close friends and family space,&#8221; Moss says. &#8220;I do think people &#8212; especially younger people &#8212; are a little bit more tired of apps that are kind of very ad-centric and very metric-centric.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You end up with these huge social circles on the app &#8212; where you have 1,000 friends on Instagram, or you have to send Snapchats back and forth with your 100 closest friends &#8212; which actually takes a lot of effort at the end of the day,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;So the idea of making something that&#8217;s more geared towards those five closest people, or those 10 closest people, and then providing a way to make your phone feel more personal and geared towards people instead of these apps &#8212; I think there&#8217;s a real appetite for that,&#8221; Moss adds.</p>
<p>Locket isn&#8217;t the first to offer a collaborative photo widget experience. Another app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnets-shared-widgets/id1520682943?ign-mpt=uo%3D4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magnets</a>, launched in 2020, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/07/magnets-app-lets-you-create-collaborative-photo-widgets-with-your-friends-on-ios-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a similar idea</a> but also supported sending short text messages to friends through its widget. Other apps competing in this space include Ekko, Widgetgram, Lettie, Tile Widget, Fave and others. However, none have yet to achieve any sort of critical mass.</p>
<p>Locket is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061">a free download on iOS</a> but has only achieved a 3.4-star rating, as some users didn&#8217;t seem to understand how to make the widget work, or were struggling with the onboarding process. The latter seemed to largely occur during the height of its viral surge when the app <a href="https://twitter.com/thefuturematt/status/1478527894087344128">was experiencing some issues,</a> but we&#8217;ve since tested Locket and found the problems to be resolved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twigcard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twig</a>, a London-based fintech targeting Gen Z and younger millennial consumers with an e-money account that gives them instant cash-outs on fashion and electronics they want to sell, has closed a $35 million Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>The investment is led by U.K.-based fintech specialist, Fasanara Capital, with additional backing from a number of undisclosed strategic investors which Twig says include current and former executives from LVMH, Valentino and Goldman Sachs, among others.</p>
<p>The startup was only founded in mid 2020 &#8212; launching its service in the U.K. last July &#8212; but it touts rapid domestic growth (100,000+ monthly downloads of its apps; reaching sixth position in the iOS App Store&#8217;s top finance apps); and is already gearing up for international expansion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series A is pegged for launching in the U.S. (slated for Q1 this year) and the EU (Q2; where it&#8217;s eyeing Italy, France and Germany for starters), as well as expanding the product&#8217;s capabilities and feature-set with a focus on the buzz around web3 and digital collectables.</p>
<p>For now, Twig accounts are only available in the U.K. Founder and CEO Geri Cupi tells TechCrunch it has around 250,000 users at this stage.</p>
<p>He adds that the typical user is a 22-year-old, recently graduated professional female &#8212; perhaps with a bunch of stuff in her wardrobe that she&#8217;s outgrown and would be happy to resell.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vinted raises $303M for its 2nd-hand clothes marketplace, used by 45M and now valued at $4.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/embed/#?secret=WLOOMW2XJa" data-secret="WLOOMW2XJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Growth via user referrals looks likely to have helped fuel its early rise, given Twig charges users a £1 transfer fee for users to send money to a third-party account but there&#8217;s no fee if you transfer from one Twig account to another.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that despite having a marketing slogan which paints itself as &#8220;your bank of things&#8221;, Twig is not actually a bank; rather a Twig account is an &#8220;e-money account&#8221; &#8212; so there are key regulatory differences (such as Twig accounts not being covered by the U.K.&#8217;s deposit guarantee scheme).</p>
<p>Not being a full fat bank means the startup can scale faster into new markets, with lighter regulatory requirements on the service than if it needed to obtain a banking licence. For now it&#8217;s not in a hurry to turn into an actual bank, per Cupi.</p>
<p>In earlier decades, long before the internet- and open banking-fuelled fintech boom, legacy banks would pitch to get a new crop of school leavers signed up by offering freebies &#8212; like bags, stationery, music or other offers. Now fintech startups compete to offer the most appealing feature mix to net a target youth demographic.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s fair to say that getting money into accounts remains a key aim.</p>
<p>That said, Twig is applying for <a href="https://bcorporation.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B Corp certification</a> which emphasizes social purpose and environmental performance, as well as transparency and accountability &#8212; Cupi says it&#8217;s in the final stage of the application; it has pending status currently and he anticipates getting full status in Q1 &#8212; while its PR pushes claims of sustainability and circularity, given that it&#8217;s plugging users into selling (rather than binning) their branded goods.</p>
<p>Its website also talks up its use of carbon offsetting and other initiatives to shrink environmental impact.</p>
<p>Thing is, in order for humanity to avert climate catastrophe, major reductions in global CO2 emissions are required &#8212; so, essentially, less consumption overall. Which does call into question the credibility of claims of &#8220;sustainability&#8221; being made to stretch around a concept of resale that risks fuelling increased consumption via instant valuations and cash outs, as Twig offers.</p>
<p>Selling a currently owned thing to free up cash might encourage the consumer to splash out and buy more new things than they otherwise would if they had held onto the original item for longer. Or, to put it another way, circularity needs to work hand in hand with longevity if it&#8217;s to shrink consumption and actually reduce CO2 emissions. And it&#8217;s not clear that reducing friction involved in reselling will lead to consumers buying less overall. On the contrary; it may do the opposite.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s one potential wrinkle in Twig&#8217;s sustainability pitch.</p>
<p>However when we put this conundrum to Cupi he neatly irons it out &#8212; deploying a (somewhat circular) argument which states that Twig&#8217;s goal of increasing &#8220;liquidity&#8221; of secondhand things can work for sustainability and support reduced consumption by making more secondhand stuff available to buy &#8212; thereby reducing demand for new stuff to be made as more items (re)circulate through this (more vibrant) secondary economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially our core business is we enable consumers to get paid for their old items and in the process we give a new life to their items &#8212; and this increases supply in the secondary market at least,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The demand in the secondary market has been growing and growing. The reason we can afford just to be on the supply side of the market is there is such a bigger need for extra supply right now in the market. And when consumers get hat extra cash it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to use it to buy more things.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is from what we&#8217;ve seen from our users. Typically from the funds that are being transferred to Twig we see that roughly 42% of them get used for new experiences &#8212; that might be travelling, it might be&#8230; experience-led &#8212; so it doesn&#8217;t mean that if you increase liquidity you necessarily increase consumerization of things that have a negative impact on the environment. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been seeing so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cupi condenses Twig&#8217;s business to a very simple pitch: &#8220;We tokenize assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way Twig works is you can upload &#8212; let&#8217;s say a Gucci Marmont handbag &#8212; on the platform. And what Twig does is it tokenizes that asset and offers you a price for it,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make this available externally as well. In that scenario blockchain becomes useful&#8230; We want to increase the liquidity of this asset and make it very easy for consumers to trade the physical goods for virtual goods and use the virtual goods to buy physical goods or experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we just want to make it much easier for them to trade, essentially.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cupi has a background in blockchain and the circular economy &#8212; which has included, back in 2018, <a href="https://medium.com/@socialdnateam/levis-albania-completes-the-acquisition-of-social-dna-ltd-53b76c6e3abd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling a denim upcycling business to Levi&#8217;s Albania</a>.</p>
<p>Physical items that resell well include fashion from brands like Nike, Gucci, Chanel, Hermes and other luxury makers, according to a Twig <a href="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/twig.publications/twig-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white paper</a> &#8212; which talks about &#8220;redefining the future of ownership&#8221; and &#8220;empowering Gen Z to live a circular lifestyle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple electronics also hold their value well on the secondhand market, per Cupi &#8212; who notes that after Twig added electronics to the secondhand items it&#8217;ll buy, expanding out from buying fashion cast offs, its demographic shifted from over 90% female to around 70:30 female to male.</p>
<p>Twig takes care of the resale of pre-owned items for its users &#8212; providing them with an instant valuation and (potentially) instant cash to spend on whatever they like if it&#8217;s happy to buy the stuff they&#8217;re selling. (It has a pretty specific list of what it will and won&#8217;t buy.)</p>
<p>Shipping the goods to Twig is free for the user &#8212; so by using its service they essentially skip the hassle and risk associated with manually selling their stuff on a second hand marketplace like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/">Vinted</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/depop-a-social-app-targeting-millennial-and-gen-z-shoppers-bags-62m-passes-13m-users/">Depop</a>. (Albeit, they may get less than if they sold the items themselves.)</p>
<p>If an item fails a quality check once it arrives at Twig&#8217;s warehouse the user is charged a fee to return it to them (and presumably any instant payment they got for it is also reversed). While if Twig ends up being unable to sell an item it says it donates the goods to charity rather than binning them to avoid sending stuff to landfill because that&#8217;s bad for the environment.</p>
<p>Cupi says it&#8217;s in a growth-focused phase at present so is not seeking to make chunky margin on resales.</p>
<p>The value it&#8217;ll offer for an item varies, depending on various dynamic factors &#8212; its white paper notes that it uses a &#8220;market-based pricing algorithm&#8221; to analyze more than 100 million products on the secondary market to provide &#8220;representative resale values for brands, item categories and market segments&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Etsy asks, &#8216;How do you do, fellow kids?&#8217; with $1.6B Depop purchase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase/embed/#?secret=4iHQtnM1TU" data-secret="4iHQtnM1TU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Core to its premise is that factoring in resale value changes the concept of total cost of ownership for the consumer &#8212; which may have the power to shift buying patterns (it could, for example, encourage consumers to opt for high-end fashion to get value longevity over environmentally ruinous and low resale value fast fashion, say).</p>
<p>Combining bank-like functionality &#8212; Twig accounts come with a Twig Visa debit card and include capabilities like the ability to make domestic and international money transfers &#8212; with a baked-in secondhand goods resale service is a pitch tailor-made for the target Gen Z and younger millennial demographic which has shown a keen and growing interest in both the thrift and sustainability of secondhand marketplaces.</p>
<p>Twig&#8217;s target demographic also explains its marketing being heavy on talk of environmental friendliness via circularity. (&#8220;Twig makes it easier and empowers you to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle,&#8221; is one claim on its retro-graphic-heavy website.)</p>
<p>Gen Z especially has been dubbed the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/10/the-environment-is-gen-zs-no-1-concern-but-beware-of-greenwashing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability generation</a> &#8212; with these young consumers prioritizing &#8220;usage of goods over ownership&#8221;, as Twig&#8217;s white paper puts it.</p>
<p>So reimagining the function of a bank as an arbiter and exchange of resale value &#8212; enabling consumers to turn all sorts of stuff into, essentially, quasi-currency to pay for other things they want to have or do (a sort of high tech reinvention of barter if you like) &#8212; rather than as a literal store of financial value starts to look pretty interesting.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another sustainability wrinkle to tackle, though &#8212; given how thoroughly blockchain is baked into what Twig&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>While its tech has been built on blockchain from the start you&#8217;d be hard pressed to notice from the user-facing descriptions on its website. But its plan for the Series A risks throwing its Gen Z-friendly eco-sounding marketing right out of whack &#8212; as its PR seeks to tap into the raging web3 hype, with the launch of what it describes as &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a first-of-its-kind Web 3.0 green payment infrastructure&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This forthcoming functionality will enable users to &#8220;tokenize&#8221; real-world assets and &#8220;make them tradeable in seconds&#8221;, its release goes on, adding that: </span>&#8220;<span class="il">Twig</span> will enable digital and physical items to be monetized and traded in new ways. Such an approach will allow users to trade-in goods at the checkout page and buy crypto currencies as well as NFTs by trading-in their clothes or electronics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite how encouraging the trading of crypto and NFTs can be spun as &#8220;green&#8221; is an interesting question to ponder.</p>
<p>After all the energy costs of crypto can look like an extinction level event, in and of themselves.</p>
<p>For example, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study last year</a> by Cambridge University suggested that just one cryptocurrency &#8212; Bitcoin &#8212; consumed more energy annually than the entire country of Argentina.</p>
<p>Another piece of research,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/10/bitcoin-rise-could-leave-carbon-footprint-size-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> from March last year</a>, suggested Bitcoin consumed as much energy as Norway &#8212; with predictions that its carbon footprint would soon be akin to the emissions generated by the entire metropolitan area of London.</p>
<p>In short, the infamous inefficiency of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies &#8212; certainly those that require proof of work to validate transactions &#8212; looks anything but sustainable.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even more wasteful energy usage being attached to blockchains too: aka the rise of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) which involve &#8212; and further encourage &#8212; the use of energy-intensive transactions by layering the trading of digital collectables atop blockchains.</p>
<p>The current hype around NFTs (as fashion/status symbols) combined with the retail trading of these digital assets &#8212; and the suggestion that hyper quick money can be made by burning energy to shift collectable pixels &#8212; pours yet more fuel on this energy bonfire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year an analysis by a digital artist suggested</a> that an average NFT could have a carbon footprint equivalent to a month&#8217;s worth of electricity usage for a person living in the EU. So, again, it&#8217;s hard to conceive of a way to spin features that encourage users to get busy tokenizing and trading their stuff &#8212; and/or digital collectables &#8212; as, in any shape or form, &#8220;green&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once again, Cupi is not phased by this counter argument, though.</p>
<p>Firstly he says that the blockchain infrastructure Twig has been built on is more energy efficient than some other blockchains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blockchain itself is not bad for the environment as a technology &#8212; there&#8217;s different applications of it,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;In our case the blockchain that we built on top of &#8212; it&#8217;s Hyperledger Sawtooth &#8212; the energy usage is very, very small compared to the other solutions out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we try to minimize the usage of energy intensive solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also specifies that Twig is calculating its internal energy usage to try to quantify its environmental impact and &#8212; at a minimum &#8212; it&#8217;s doing carbon offsetting to counteract this.</p>
<p>He says it is also supporting projects that are seeking to sequester/remove CO2 from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although how viable/credible the specific projects are is a whole other matter.</p>

<p>While Twig may be seeking to minimize/offset its own energy usage/carbon footprint, the bigger potential environmental impact is likely to be from secondary (for want of a better word) usage &#8212; aka, any consumption, energy use and CO2 emissions that Twig&#8217;s users and suppliers generate as a result of what its platform enables them to do.</p>
<p>Calculating those linked but indirect impacts &#8212; sometimes called &#8220;Scope 3&#8221; emissions, in sustainability reporting terms &#8212; is much harder than doing an internal audit of a business&#8217; direct energy usage. Yet Scope 3 emissions also tend to comprise the biggest chunk of an organization&#8217;s carbon footprint. So you can&#8217;t just wish all those connected transactions, emissions and effects away.</p>
<p>Twig is clearly trying to tackle some of this &#8212; by doing carbon offsetting to cover the shipping of goods, for example. And its ambition to gain B Corp status looks laudable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a lot harder to predict what sort of energy costs its platform may ultimately end up generating &#8212; based on the consumer demands and trends it might feed and/or drain.</p>
<p>By encouraging users to buy crypto and get into trading NFTs it&#8217;s clear there will be associated energy costs. And there is a risk that such intensive energy costs could end up erasing potential environmental gains (if Twig is able to turn increased liquidity of secondhand goods into a net reduction in manufacturing of new items via reduced demand from consumers to buy new).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also possible that such a radical reimagining of what can be used to make a payment &#8212; all sorts of items/things/stuff; in theory a consumer may not need to ever spend actual money in a world of tokenized value &#8212; could lead to substantial shifts in consumption that can actually move the needle on circularity. And move our societies away from the vicious circle of throwaway consumption that&#8217;s characterized so many decades of capitalism.</p>
<p>Put another way, if the things we have can be relied upon to more predictably sustain their value for resale &#8212; thanks to the help of blockchain-based tokenization (which can support authentication to combat fakes) and more stable valuations (based on knowing the full ownership history via a distributed ledger infrastructure) &#8212; consumers may be nudged to take better care of the stuff they have in order to preserve its longevity for better resale, meaning the world&#8217;s industries won&#8217;t need to make half so many things in the first place &#8212; lifting crippling systemic pressure on planetary resources.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a thought.</p>
<p>De-emphasizing money by making it much easier to make payments by exchanging all sorts of things might be exactly the kicker we need to rework how we think about value, ownership and wealth. And, indeed, planetary resources.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Cupi again: &#8220;Instead of using your own cash to buy NFTs you can use things that you have at home and don&#8217;t use anymore &#8212; for instance you might have an old iPhone that you don&#8217;t use anymore and you can trade that for an NFT or you can trade that for some cryptocurrency or you can use that to buy an experience &#8212; you can use that to buy a trip to New York or you can use that to pay for your next vocational course&#8230; So the whole purpose of Twig is to increase liquidity in the market and &#8212; essentially &#8212; to make it very easy for people to use assets that they don&#8217;t use anymore and give them a second life.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way our ethos is you can both do good to your wallet and to the Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vision for Twig is therefore to turn itself into a payments platform &#8212; but one that translates physical goods into payments on behalf of its users/customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment Twig is just a B2C platform &#8212; but it&#8217;s going to become a B2B2C platform. So it will be connected as a payment gateway of different providers,&#8221; he says, noting that it has inked agreements with &#8220;a couple of big merchants&#8221; to be plugged into its infrastructure (he&#8217;s not disclosing which retailers as yet).</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do &#8212; essentially &#8212; is to reinvent the definition of wealth,&#8221; Cupi adds, discussing how he sees the notion of money evolving. &#8220;So if everything that you own can be treated as money your perception of wealth also changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old definition of wealth is the value of your largest asset &#8212; the value of your house, the value of your car&#8230; But you don&#8217;t see as part of your wealth &#8212; typically &#8212; the value of your wardrobe, for instance. This is what we&#8217;re trying to change. And in that way if everything has instant liquidity you can treat your things as cash. It doesn&#8217;t make a difference whether it&#8217;s cash &#8212; or a Gucci Marmont handbag. If you want to buy something in pounds it&#8217;s then the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if Twig gets its way the future of payments might get a whole lot more visual and physical &#8212; maybe you&#8217;ll be buying a secondhand iPhone by dragging and dropping an NFT you minted into the ecommerce payment window.</p>
<p>Or posting off a pair of limited edition Nikes to score that sweet Spring city break you&#8217;ve been looking forward to.</p>
<p>Or, er, buying a chunk of prime real estate with some prize pieces of diamond-encrusted jewellery&#8230;</p>
<p>While younger consumers may already be comfortable with a world of fairly commoditized value tradable stuff, what about older consumers? Does Cupi reckon Boomers or Gen X can be convinced to start making payments by parting with things they&#8217;ve ploughed their cash into?</p>
<p>Are first edition signed books and prize vinyl pressings going to end up folded into the future payment mix?</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest I don&#8217;t know the answer to that,&#8221; he says. &#8220;At the moment we&#8217;re seeing our product, Gen Z reacts very well to it. And also young millennials &#8212; so twentysomethings&#8230; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; and in the U.K. It might be a different picture once we go to other markets as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinese scientists believe most of the molecules came to the Moon through a process called solar wind implantation. Charged particles from the sun drove hydrogen atoms to the lunar surface where they later bonded with oxygen to form water and hydroxyl. The study builds on findings NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-moon-sunlight-water-sofia-artemis-162600047.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>published in 2018</ins></a> when it found evidence of water on the sunlit surfaces of the Moon using an airborne infrared telescope. For decades, scientists had believed the Moon was completely dry due to its almost nonexistent atmosphere. With no atmosphere, the thought was there was nothing there to protect water molecules from the sun’s harsh radiation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Labor Relations Board today issued an announcement detailing plans for a second vote among Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse employees. The planned follow-up would be conducted via USPS mail-in ballots, which will be mailed out February 4 and counted March 28.</p>
<p>Late last year, the director of the NLRB’s 10th region <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/labor-board-authorizes-new-amazon-union-vote/">announced</a> that a second vote would occur, following Amazon’s lopsided victory against unionization. In a notice published by the NLRB, the organization notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The election that commenced on February 8, 2021, was set aside because the National Labor Relations Board found the Employer interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice by creating the appearance of irregularity in the election procedure by causing a mailbox to be installed outside the Employer’s main entrance and by improperly polling employees’ support during mandatory meetings. Therefore, a new election will be held in accordance with the terms of this Notice of Second Election. All eligible voters should understand the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, gives them the right to cast their ballots as they see fit and protects them in the exercise of this right, free from interference by any of the parties.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ruling on a second vote followed complaints from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union that Amazon had violated the vote by installing an on-site mailbox and “vote no” signage around the site. The company has long insisted that the failure to unionize reflects the will of its fulfillment center workers.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch at the time, “Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It’s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count.”</p>
<p>Questions around in-person voting were raised by the RWDSU during the initial vote, due to both pandemic concerns and potential voter coercion. The new vote will be conducted via secret ballot.</p>
<p>The RWDSU offered TechCrunch the following statement in the wake of this morning&#8217;s news,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Amazon’s misconduct during the first union election so tainted the outcome that the NLRB overturned the results and directed a second election for workers in Bessemer, Alabama. We are deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election. We proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers, which were not taken up in the Notice of Election issued today. Workers&#8217; voices can and must be heard fairly, unencumbered by Amazon’s limitless power to control what must be a fair and free election, and we will continue to hold them accountable for their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Amazon responded to the news, as well, telling TechCrunch, “Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU last year. We look forward to our team in BHM1 having their voices heard again.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> announced this morning that it has acquired Australian startup <a href="http://envizi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Envizi</a> to add to its package of ESG (environmental, social and governance) offerings to help measure environmental impact up and down the supply chain.</p>
<p>The companies did not share the terms of the acquisition, but with Envizi Big Blue gets a platform for measuring, managing and optimizing a customer&#8217;s environmental sustainability efforts. In other words, it&#8217;s taking a data-centric approach to the problem just as it did when it was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/10/ibm-watson-health-unit-begins-to-take-shape/"> building Watson Health in 2016</a>, a division that it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ibm-reportedly-shopping-watson-health-just-as-healthcare-gets-hot/">reportedly trying to sell</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>Kareem Yusuf, general manager for IBM AI Applications, said that companies need data to drive insights, and that&#8217;s what his company is getting with Envizi.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256229" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Envizi&#8217;s software provides companies with a single source of truth for analyzing and understanding emissions data across the full landscape of their business operations and dramatically accelerates IBM&#8217;s growing arsenal of AI technologies for helping businesses create more sustainable operations and supply chains,&#8221; Yusuf said in a statement.</p>
<p>Envizi CEO and co-founder David Solsky sees this as a way to scale the company by taking advantage of IBM&#8217;s global presence, a typical argument for a company being swallowed up by a much larger one. &#8220;Today doesn’t mark the end of an era, nor the beginning of a new one. Rather, it is a transition to a structure that is going to allow us to scale at an unprecedented rate and globally help our clients accelerate progress toward their sustainability commitments,&#8221; Solsky wrote <a href="https://envizi.com/blog/envizi_acquisition_ibm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<p>IBM sees Envizi as AI-driven software to add to its existing package of products that includes the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, IBM Maximo asset management solutions and IBM Sterling supply chain solutions. The latter uses the IBM blockchain for sourcing and traceability along the supply chain, which could improve safety or traceability.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that even as the company continues to pursue AI-fueled solutions, this time it did not attach the name Watson to its ESG efforts, as it did with the healthcare initiative six years ago. Perhaps IBM has decided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/technology/what-happened-ibm-watson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Watson brand</a> has lost some of its shine over the years and has moved on from attaching the name to every AI-driven solution in the company.</p>
<p>The company notes that it is using these same software tools in-house to help drive its own sustainability efforts as it works to reach<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/"> net-zero</a> greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku is furthering its investment in its Live TV platform with today&#8217;s introduction of a new &#8220;Live TV Zone&#8221; that will roll out to the main, left-side navigation on Roku devices. The addition is designed to promote and highlight Roku&#8217;s livestreaming options, which include its rapidly growing live TV channel guide, now offering free access to <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/the-roku-channel-15-new-live-linear-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 live channels</a> featuring news, weather, kids&#8217; content, sports, movies, tv shows, Spanish-language programming and more.</p>
<p>The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/the-roku-channel-expands-to-include-over-100-live-channels-adds-a-live-tv-guide/">launched</a> its live TV channel guide in 2020 as part of its broader free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, where Roku owners can also stream ad-supported TV shows and movies. At the time, the guide had provided access to over 100 channels from a branded, purple tile that appeared within The Roku Channel. When launched, users could browse through 12 hours of programming information. The experience, which is similar to how pay-TV viewers can browse what&#8217;s now airing in their own provider&#8217;s guide, helps to make the transition to Roku easier for cord-cutters who are used to turning on their TV and accessing live content. However, it also serves as a way to stream shows, movies, news and more without a paid streaming subscription &#8212; an option that may appeal to those looking to save money through cord-cutting.</p>
<p>With the live TV service, Roku positioned itself as more of a direct challenger to other free streamers, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/viacom-buys-the-free-video-streaming-service-pluto-tv-for-340-million/">ViacomCBS-owned</a> Pluto TV and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/comcast-to-buy-xumo-for-ad-supported-streaming-service-and-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comcast&#8217;s</a> XUMO. The former, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached $1 billion</a> in annual revenue last year &#8212; about a year ahead of schedule &#8212; is an indication of the sizable revenue available in this market. Plus, the rollout of livestreaming has enabled media software maker Plex to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/plex-raises-50m-growth-round-to-fuel-ad-supported-streaming-expansions/">grow its business</a> and further fund its mission of becoming a one-stop shop for consumers&#8217; media needs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Roku, meanwhile, generates the majority of its revenue through its platform, not device sales. In other words, largely through advertising inserted inside its free content and content distribution. That&#8217;s also the part of the business that&#8217;s currently growing.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/roku-q3-2021-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent quarter</a>, Roku&#8217;s platform revenue was up 82% year-over-year, to $582.5 million, while player revenue dropped by 26%, to $97.4 million. Streaming hours in the quarter were also up 21%, to 18 billion, with active accounts (56.4 million) streaming 3.5 hours per day.</p>
<p>The company noted, too, that its <a href="https://roku-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Streaming-Report_FINAL_Sept-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://roku-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Streaming-Report_FINAL_Sept-2021.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641995612603000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3o9LFkPkTVPm-3lWob2KaK">recent streaming survey</a> found that 61% of users without traditional pay TV still watch live news at least multiple times a week. So this update will play into that demand by making live news easier to access.</p>
<p>To get to the new Live TV Zone, you can either scroll down on the left-hand navigation to the &#8220;Live TV&#8221; option or do a search for &#8220;Live TV Zone&#8221; from the device. The feature is rolling out starting today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magna has acquired the technology, IP and assets of Optimus Ride, a startup based in Boston that was trying to commercialize electric autonomous shuttles. As part of the deal <a href="https://www.magna.com/company/newsroom/releases/release/2022/01/11/news-release---magna-adds-more-than-120-engineers-strengthens-adas-capabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Tuesday</a>, Magna has hired more than 120 employees of Optimus Ride. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed,</p>
<p>Optimus Ride CEO Sean Harrington will not make the jump over to Magna and the AV startup will cease its operations.</p>
<p>Magna aims to leverage the tech and expertise from Optimus Ride to beef up its efforts in advanced driver assistance systems — technology that is in high demand. Magna has been keen to build out its ADAS offerings; last year the company tried to acquire Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer, but was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/">nudged out by Qualcomm</a>. Veoneer&#8217;s Arriver tech &#8212; an advanced driver assistance system stack that includes sensors and software &#8212; was sold to Qualcomm, while the Swedish company&#8217;s other Tier 1 supplier businesses were retained by investment group SSW Partners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Growing our engineering bench strength in sensing hardware and software helps accelerate our path forward in a rapidly growing ADAS market,&#8221; John O&#8217;Hara, president of Magna Electronics, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The former Optimus Ride engineers will remain in Boston. Magna will use this new team to establish a Boston-based engineering center, which in turn could help the company attract more software and robotics talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;As advancements in autonomy continue, we saw an opportunity to bring in additional expertise to support current programs as well as future customer needs. We are happy to welcome the Optimus Ride employees to the Magna family,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a new partnership that should break new ground for sustainable orbital operations, &#8220;gas stations in space&#8221; startup Orbit Fab has teamed with Astroscale to provide on-orbit refueling services to the latter company&#8217;s LEXI (life extension in-orbit) geostationary servicing spacecraft.</p>
<p>Both Astroscale and Orbit Fab&#8217;s core offerings are designed to provided ways for satellites to extend their useful life. Orbit Fab has designed technology that aims to make it easy for satellites to get fueled up while in space, with a custom interface that makes it possible for other spacecraft to latch on and transfer fuel easily while on orbit. Astroscale is using its LEXI satellite to mission extension provide to existing spacecraft located in geostationary orbit (GEO), by attaching to them and correcting their course, or relocating them to a new target inclination.</p>
<p>Astroscale is touting LEXI as &#8220;the first satellite designed to be refueled,&#8221; which makes it a perfect target customer for Orbit Fab&#8217;s refueling interface (the Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface or RAFTI for short) and roving orbital tanker. If all goes to plan, the first Astroscale LEXI will be active in space by 2026, and Orbit Fab is contracted to provide the LEXI fleet with up to 1,000 kg of Xenon propellant for top ups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256227" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orbit Fab says it plans to have &#8220;dozens&#8221; of fuel tankers and shuttles in space over the next five to 10 years, with spacecraft placed strategically in low Earth orbit (LEO), GEO and also in cislunar space, which should become a more active destination as NASA ramps its Artemis program. The first Orbit Fab fueling spacecraft should be in LEO by 2023 if all goes to plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.doctolib.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doctolib</a> is expected to close the acquisition of <a href="https://tanker.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanker</a> today (based on regulatory filings). Doctolib is a French unicorn that develops a software-as-a-service product to help doctors and medical workers with admin tasks. In particular, Doctolib acts as a booking platform that connects doctors with patients; 300,000 health professionals pay for the service and 60 million people have used it in Europe.</p>
<p>Tanker helps healthcare tech companies secure user data. The startup has developed a protocol as well as client-side development kits that can be integrated in a web app, a mobile app or a desktop app.</p>
<p>After you add Tanker to your product, messages and files that are shared between patients and health professionals are end-to-end encrypted. Tanker and its customers can’t decrypt files or messages as it doesn’t have access to the private encryption key. In other words, if you’re not the sender nor the recipient, you can’t decrypt the data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With a focus on the healthcare industry, Tanker lists Doctolib, healthcare insurance startup <a href="https://alan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan</a> and telehealth startup <a href="https://www.qare.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qare</a> as its customers on <a href="https://tanker.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company’s website</a>. In June 2020, Doctolib announced that it added end-to-end encryption thanks to a <a href="https://info.doctolib.fr/blog/doctolib-adopte-le-chiffrement-de-bout-en-bout-nouvelle-etape-dans-la-securisation-des-donnees-de-sante/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership with Tanker</a>.</p>
<p>A source sent me a regulatory filing from January 3, 2022 with details on the transaction between Doctolib and Tanker. A previous regulatory filing from December 22, 2021 also mentions the acquisition. You can view both of these documents on <a href="https://www.pappers.fr/entreprise/doctolib-794598813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pappers</a>.</p>
<p>“Doctolib plans to acquire the shares of the company named Tanker,” a lawyer writes in a letter. “This transaction would be conducted based on the terms of the agreement protocol signed on December 9th, 2021, which involves transferring 100% of the shares of the capital of the company Tanker for the benefit of Doctolib.”</p>
<p>The most recent filing mentions January 11, 2022 as the closing date for the transaction, which is today. Another source told me that the acquisition was currently happening. We have reached out to Doctolib, but received a &#8220;no comment&#8221; on the matter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based on the legal documents, Doctolib is acquiring Tanker in a cash and stock transaction, which would value Tanker at $28 million to $34 million (€25 million to €30 million).</p>
<h2>The valuation enigma</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers/">wrote</a> about Doctolib’s press conference on its most recent metrics and upcoming product releases. Interestingly, Doctolib co-founder and CEO Stanislas Niox-Chateau said they “have stopped communicating on funding rounds for the past several years. Every quarter, every year, investors invest once again or invest for the first time based on our long-term project.”</p>
<p>Back in 2019, the company said that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/doctolib-is-now-a-unicorn-with-new-170-million-round/">reached</a> a valuation of $1.13 billion (€1 billion). That’s the last time Doctolib talked about funding rounds.</p>
<p>But that’s not the most recent funding round. For instance, as Charlie Perreau <a href="https://twitter.com/CharliePERREAU/status/1480602092796526596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a>, General Atlantic invested $69 million (€61 million) in the company back in February 2020.</p>
<p>As for the company’s valuation, based on Tanker’s acquisition, each Doctolib share is worth €170.91. There are currently around 18 million Doctolib shares, which means that Doctolib could be valued at roughly €3 billion ($3.4 billion).</p>
<p>That valuation seems low given Doctolib&#8217;s customer base (300,000) and Doctolib&#8217;s starting price (€129 per month). Maybe Doctolib&#8217;s shares were a bit undervalued as a nice gesture for Tanker investors. Maybe Doctolib hasn&#8217;t raised in a while and is about to raise at a higher valuation. It remains an enigma for now.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The results are proving to be pure trash so frequently once the hype has died down and real, post-debut life begins that I would hazard we've collected enough data to call the SPAC boom a failure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s painful to watch SPAC deals collapse post-combination. You can viscerally feel dreams melting away to disappointment as founders, employees and investors still holding shares in the newly public entities watch their wealth dwindle.</p>
<p>The mess is not sector-specific. Media? Not a good SPAC target. Insurtech? Nope. 3D printing? Not looking good. E-scooters? Nerp. Hardware and software for apartment buildings? Not that either. Fintech? A mixed bag, but with some pretty poor results as well.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>SPACs did manage to get a number of startups and unicorns public more quickly than they might have managed on their own. But the results are proving to be pure trash so frequently once the hype has died down and real, post-debut life begins that I would hazard that we&#8217;ve collected enough data to call the SPAC boom a failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A failure in what terms? In that SPACs will not become the chariots that help transport enough unicorns across the private-public market divide and begin to cut down on the rising number of pricey former startups collecting by the exits of Startup Land. The results are just too icky for that to work out.</p>
<h2>The unicorn pileup</h2>
<p>One of the most quietly pressing issues in technology investing today is the fact that the number of unicorns continues to grow, year after year. This is to say that the pace at which venture capitalists and other private-market investors can take companies public is far slower than the rate at which they can generate paper wealth. North of 900 unicorns are waiting for an exit, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/unicorn-leaderboard-privately-held/488c2557-4d5a-4c25-8bd3-61c519f07508/identifiers">Crunchbase counting 944</a> and <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">CB Insights landing on a slightly higher figure of 959</a>.</p>
<p>The result is that several <em>trillions</em> of dollars of value are sitting on the sidelines of the capital markets, waiting to be called into the game. And SPACs had a shot at helping.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adelaide-based startup <a href="https://www.fertil.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fertilis</a> is the latest to join a wave of companies worldwide that are trying to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) less stressful and more successful for patients and clinicians.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Fertilis&#8217;s technology to automate cell culture with micro medical devices has won support from some investors. Horizons Ventures, the venture capital firm of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing and an early investor in Facebook and Spotify, recently led Fertilis&#8217;s seed round of AUS$2.75 million ($1.98 million). Other investors were not disclosed.</p>
<p>In 2019, the percentage of IVF treatments that led to a live birth <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was merely 32%</a> for women under 35, according to the U.K.&#8217;s National Health Service. Factors like patients&#8217; age and the quality of sperms and eggs can affect success rates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254924" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A flurry of startups has been working to improve embryo selection, such as Israel-based Embryonics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/this-startup-says-its-ai-can-better-spot-a-healthy-embryo-and-improve-ivf-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which we covered</a>. Fertilis, founded by reproductive biologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-thompson-6a111a17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Thompson</a> and serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martygauvin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Gauvin</a>, is tackling the problem from a different angle &#8212; embryo incubation.</p>
<p>An IVF clinic is &#8220;a very busy place&#8221; where professionals &#8220;are trained in everything they have to do,&#8221; Thompson said in an interview with TechCrunch. A standard IVF process involves transferring cells to different environments in a petri dish as an embryo develops. But from retrieving the egg, carrying the petri dish across the lab, to putting the embryo in the reproductive tract, &#8220;there are all sorts of things that can go wrong,&#8221; the biologist suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time an embryo gets picked up by a clinician, the environment is negatively affected,&#8221; Thompson remarked. &#8220;The hopes and dreams of the patients are literally in every step [the clinician] takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fertilis&#8217;s solution is to standardize and automate the IVF process by putting each embryo in its patented 3D-printed cradle. The device, the width of a hair, allows for culturing of cells in environments that &#8220;more closely resemble the environment of the human body,&#8221; Thompson said. The cradles will then go onto a petri dish, so clinicians won&#8217;t need to handle the embryo directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the regulatory world for reproductive technology, Fertilis sits in a unique position. Because it&#8217;s producing a medical device that acts on cells rather than humans, regulations it faces are more &#8220;straightforward in some countries,&#8221; said Gauvin. The company is currently seeking FDA approval.</p>
<p>Fertilis&#8217;s new funding will support its ongoing scientific development. It plans to start clinical trials globally late this year, with an agreement in place to conduct trials with a fertility clinic in California; it is also talking to partners in Europe and Asia with agreements expected to be signed in the coming months. By 2023, the startup aims to introduce its first commercial product.</p>
<p>Technically, Fertilis&#8217; grain-size devices can be used to culture other types of cells. Fertilization is just its starting point.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Fertilis&#8217; technology will have a transformative impact on a wide range of healthcare applications that ranges from diagnostics and treatment to the creation of specific cell culture products,&#8221; said Chris Liu, Horizons Ventures&#8217; Australia-based investor.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Turo income statement, once we beat back some non-cash costs muddying its bottom line, has me impressed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer car-sharing company Turo <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed to go public</a> last night. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/">first look at its S-1 filing is here</a>, in case you missed it.</p>
<p>That Turo has filed to go public is not a surprise. After <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/turo/company_financials/funding_rounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising nearly $500 million while private</a>, the company has an enormous capital base underneath it, meaning that there is also institutional pressure for the firm to pursue an IPO. Turo first raised external capital back in 2009, Crunchbase data indicates, so some investors have been waiting for the company&#8217;s S-1 filing for a long, long while.</p>

<hr />
<p>The good news is that Turo&#8217;s business had a turnaround year last year. After posting somewhat lackluster 2020 results, Turo saw its revenues and results rebound, at least through the third quarter. We&#8217;ll get Q4 data in a subsequent S-1 filing.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This morning, I want to compare and contrast the company&#8217;s 2020 and 2021 results as a way to show how some unicorns will come out of the pandemic with jets on. Frankly, the Turo income statement, once we beat back some non-cash costs muddying its bottom line, has me impressed.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about acceleration post-lockdown.</p>
<h2>Turo&#8217;s financial rebound</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, Turo recorded slim revenue growth. The company&#8217;s top line grew from $141.7 million to $149.9 million, or around 6%. For a venture-backed company ramping toward an IPO, that&#8217;s an incredibly thin pace of growth.</p>
<p>Even worse, the company&#8217;s net losses stayed essentially flat during the period, decreasing just a smidge from $98.6 million worth of negative net income in 2019 to $97.1 million in 2020.</p>
<p>But then, 2021 came around. Observe the differential in results:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256130" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256130 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png 827w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=768,350 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=680,310 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Turo S-1</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see when we contrast the first three quarters of 2020 with the same portion of 2021, the company&#8217;s revenue growth reignited, and it swung from stinging operating losses to operating profits. It appears that last year was a rebirth of sorts for Turo &#8212; it left slow growth behind for hyper-growth (207% between 2020 and 2021, for the periods listed) and losses for profits (on an operating basis).</p>
<p><em>Yes but,</em> I can hear you saying,<em> the company&#8217;s net loss actually got worse in the first three quarters of 2021 when compared with the preceding year. Why are we giving it plaudits for growth when it torched so much money? </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every company has to decide what to pay their employees and track that compensation in some way, often in spreadsheets and across disparate payroll, finance and HR systems. Companies also need to ensure that they are paying people with comparable experience a similar amount for the same job.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemble.inc/">Assemble</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to bring organization to this process, and today it announced a $5 million seed investment from Susa Ventures, Goldcrest Capital and several industry angels.</p>
<p>Assemble co-founder Enrique Esclusa said that the startup has created a system of engagement for compensation decisions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a system that assembles all that compensation and workforce data in one central location that usually lives in disparate systems, and then makes it not only accessible but actionable and easy to understand for various stakeholders across the company,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Esclusa and his co-founder, Lisa Wallace, worked together at another company where Wallace was in charge of hiring and Esclusa managed finance and business operations. It was there that they learned firsthand just how hard it was to track this type of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we realized was that virtually everything lived in spreadsheets, which is a really painful and time-consuming way to put all this data and frameworks together, share the right information with people who are making decisions across the company, and make decisions that not only were competitive enough so that you could hire folks and attract them and retain employees, but also were financially responsible and fair and equitable,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So in 2020, the two founders got together and decided to do something about it, and built a product to address the issues they experienced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WCIcC5BDO8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/the-need-for-true-equity-in-equity-compensation/">The need for true equity in equity compensation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The need for true equity in equity compensation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/the-need-for-true-equity-in-equity-compensation/embed/#?secret=WCIcC5BDO8" data-secret="WCIcC5BDO8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wallace said that companies typically don&#8217;t consider equity in a direct way as they build an organization, then go back and try to fix it, a process that requires consultants to pull the information from various systems. Assemble is designed to build equity into the compensation system from the start.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about running a pay equity analysis in one place, or providing one-off visibility to managers in another place. It&#8217;s about truly having a layer of engagement across your organization that works from multiple stakeholders that are touching compensation because there are so many different stakeholders and so many different objectives, and it&#8217;s really easy to go off the rails,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256133" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256133" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?w=680" alt="Assemble pay equity report." width="680" height="431" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png 2556w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=768,487 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=1536,974 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=2048,1298 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/assemble-pay-equity.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256133" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Assemble</p></div></p>
<p>Assemble. currently has 10 employees, and with a diverse founding team and a DE&amp;I mission around pay equity, they are working to build a diverse and inclusive company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made a pretty concerted effort for each rec that we&#8217;ve opened to interview and evaluate diverse candidates. … It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really focused on, and Enrique and I spend about a third of our time recruiting,&#8221; she said, adding that while they only have the 10 employees so far, their diversity numbers are fairly good on a number of metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re 40% Hispanic as a company and 60% of us are immigrants or the children of immigrants,&#8221; she said. While just two of the current 10 employees are women, Wallace said that&#8217;s something she&#8217;s working to address in future hires. She said that the company is also working on diversity on the funding side by bringing in a number of historically underrepresented angel investors into the cap table.</p>
<p>Since compensation doesn&#8217;t live on its own inside an organization, Assemble works in conjunction with HR and payroll software tools like WorkDay, Gusto, ADP and Bamboo HR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A brewing scandal over the alleged historical use of controversial mobile spyware by Poland&#8217;s ruling party against an opposition lawmaker is raising questions over the legitimacy of the country&#8217;s 2019 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Internet watchdog Citizen Lab found that the NSO Group&#8217;s notorious spyware Pegasus was used to spy on three critics of the Polish government. One of the targets was named Krzysztof Brejza, a member of the Polish Senate whose phone was hacked dozens of times ahead of parliamentary elections in 2019.</p>
<p>Text messages stolen from Brejza’s phone were doctored and aired by state-controlled TV as part of an apparent smear campaign in the run-up to the election. Brejza&#8217;s left-leaning political coalition, Civic Platform, subsequently lost the country&#8217;s 2019 parliamentary election by a close margin.

<p>The Polish government previously denied that it has used Pegasus, a mobile spyware that gives its government customers near-complete access to a target’s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and precise location.</p>
<p>Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland&#8217;s Law and Justice party and the country&#8217;s deputy prime minister, rebuked accusations that the Polish government used the Pegasus spyware to monitor its political opposition, but told <a href="https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/580785-kaczynski-dla-sieci-o-pegasusie-opozycja-opowiada-bzdury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polish media</a> last week that it &#8220;would be bad&#8221; if the Polish security services did not have access to mobile spying technology while other countries did.</p>
<p>Polish media reports that the government purchased Pegasus in 2017 using money from the so-called Justice Fund, which is supposed to help victims of crimes and rehabilitate offenders.</p>
<p>Amnesty International late last week independently <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/01/poland-use-of-pegasus-spyware-to-hack-politicians-highlights-threat-to-civil-society/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verified</a> that Brezja&#8217;s phone was hacked.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We urgently need governments to implement a global moratorium on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards are in place.&#8221;<br />
<cite>Likhita Banerji, Amnesty International</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the Associated Press and Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings “fake news” and claimed a foreign intelligence service could be to blame. Critics dismissed the government&#8217;s allegation, arguing that no other government would have any interest in the three Polish targets.</p>
<p>The other two Polish targets confirmed by Citizen Lab are Roman Giertych, a lawyer who represents opposition politicians in a number of politically sensitive cases, and prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek. Apple began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/apple-nso-hacking-notify/">notifying phone spying victims</a> in December after it sued NSO to block the spyware maker from using any of Apple&#8217;s technologies, which would make it significantly harder for NSO to hack its targets.</p>
<p>Pegasus is known to be used by authoritarian governments like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda and the United Arab Emirates to spy on journalists, politicians and human rights defenders. But new reporting last year revealed several European Union states, including <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-admits-to-using-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/a-59726217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungary</a>, are Pegasus customers, as is now Poland.</p>
<p>Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk — the new leader of Civic Platform since October 2021 — has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the government&#8217;s use of Pegasus. Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal member of the European Parliament for Renew Europe, told TechCrunch that the allegations must be investigated to get a full picture of how the Polish government is using Pegasus.</p>
<p>“But what we do know is deeply worrying,” he said. “This is obviously a threat to both the rule of law as well as free and fair elections — and therefore both to EU rules as well as the integrity of the European Union. If that’s not enough for a full European investigation, what is?”</p>
<p>When reached, an unnamed spokesperson for NSO Group declined to confirm or deny its customers but added: &#8220;The use of cyber tools in order to monitor dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools. The international community should have zero tolerance policy towards such acts, therefore a global regulation is needed. NSO has proven in the past it has zero-tolerance for these types of misuse, by terminating multiple contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amnesty International, which called the findings “shocking, but not surprising,” is also calling for the European Union to implement targeted sanctions against NSO Group, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">much like the U.S. government has done</a>.</p>
<p>“This shows, yet again, that the unchecked use of Pegasus is a threat to not just politicians, but to civil society around the world. So far not enough has been done to reign in unlawful targeted surveillance,&#8221; Likhita Banerji, a researcher and advisor at Amnesty International, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We urgently need governments to implement a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/doc10/4516/2021/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global moratorium</a> on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards are in place.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The firm is targeting capital at early-stage investments in enterprise, consumer, hardtech, fintech and healthcare companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleiner Perkins</a>, one of Silicon Valley’s legacy venture capital firms, is kicking off 2022 right by celebrating five decades in business and $1.8 billion in funds raised for two new funds — KP20 and Select2.</p>
<p>KP20 is an $800 million venture fund focused on early-stage investments in enterprise, consumer, hardtech, fintech and healthcare companies, while Select2 is a $1 billion fund — the most the firm has raised at once — that extends its core investment strategy to focus on high inflection investments across those same five areas.</p>
<p>Select2 follows the <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/kleiner-perkins-select/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$750 million Kleiner Perkins Select</a> fund the firm announced last April.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255931" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Partner Ilya Fushman told TechCrunch that the firm’s focus is the same today as it was when Kleiner Perkins started in 1972: “Venture is a non-scalable, boutique craft that requires incredibly dedicated practitioners with diverse and complementary backgrounds that span technology, operating and investing.”</p>
<p>With a history of being early investors in technology darlings, like Google, Amazon, Netscape and Genentech, Fushman said the investor team curated over the past four years is taking over the next generation of the firm, while the new funds will be able to back the next generation of iconic companies, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2255933" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255933" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255933" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png" alt="Kleiner Perkins" width="1024" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255933" class="wp-caption-text">Kleiner Perkins&#8217; investor team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kleiner Perkins</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the funds, Kleiner Perkins promoted several team members as new partners: Annie Case, a consumer marketplaces and digital health expert, and Josh Coyne, who leads investments in business software.</p>
<p>Case told TechCrunch that within the digital health space, she is seeing more investment going into mental and behavioral health and alternative medicines, while on the consumer side, there is a lot happening in education technology, mainly due to school districts and parents adapting to the experience of teaching during the global pandemic. The firm is also spending more time looking at opportunities in crypto and web3.</p>
<p>As for raising $1.8 billion in one go, Fushman says Kleiner Perkins is adjusting to the current conditions where companies are not only growing bigger and faster, but also growing across sectors, technology and internationally. The scale of opportunity is bigger than ever before, and that is reflected in exit valuations and the number of companies that get started each year.</p>
<p>And having more fund capital at the firm’s disposal enables the company to deploy it into later rounds, or with a bigger check to get in, and still be able to provide a similar venture assistance Kleiner Perkins is known for in the early stage.</p>
<p>“The market overall for venture makes it an exciting time to grow beyond early-stage and provide a full spectrum of capital,” Fushman said. “As we help companies grow, if we see them hitting an inflection or we miss out on the Series A, we can do something from the Select fund.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://about.amazevr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AmazeVR</a>, a virtual reality concert platform that enables users to experience their favorite artists’ VR concerts through content generation tools, announced today it has secured $15 million, which was oversubscribed within three weeks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="http://www.partnersi.co.kr/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Partners Investment</a> and <a href="http://murexpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murex Partners</a> co-led the new funding, with participation from Smilegate Investment, <a href="http://quantumepk.com/index_en.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantum Ventures Korea</a>, <a href="http://www.abc-partners.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC Partners</a>, Everrich Group, GS Group&#8217;s corporate venture capital firm <a href="https://www.gsfutures.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GS Futures</a>, We Ventures, Base Investment and <a href="https://dunamupartners.com/?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunamu &amp; Partners</a>. Previous backers Mirae Asset Venture Investment, Mirae Asset Capital, Partners Investment and Timewise Investment also participated. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AmazeVR has raised a total of $30.8 million since its inception in 2015 and plans to raise a Series B in early 2022 to drive its rapid growth, the company said. Co-CEO of AmazeVR Ernest Lee told TechCrunch that the startup would use the fresh capital for hiring additional headcount. AmazeVR began 2021 with 12 employees, but now the company has tripled its team in Hollywood and Seoul, with 41 employees, Lee noted.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255453" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We’ve been able to attract top talent from the [music, entertainment, tech and gaming] industries we touch,” Lee said. “This puts us in an ideal position to take full advantage of VR and the metaverse’s growing popularity, as we deliver breathtaking VR concerts from major artists, first to theaters, then to homes worldwide.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the wake of social media, fans have unprecedented access to their favorite artists but are still separated by a screen. VR concerts by AmazeVR take the fan across the screen to come face-to-face with their favorite artists to create a human connection, </span>Lee said. Users would join as avatars, hang out with other users, and experience VR concerts together.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our goal is for the technology to be so good that it becomes invisible so that the fan’s memory is not that of a great VR experience, but it’s that they actually came face to face with their favorite artists in fantastical immersive environments, blurring the lines of reality,” Lee said in an interview with TechCrunch. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Headquartered in Los Angeles, with an office in Seoul, AmazeVR was founded by JB Lee, Steve Lee, Jeremy Nam and Steven Koo, all former executives of South Korean messaging app <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/035720.KS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kakao</a>. After Kakao’s stock market debut, the four co-founders, who wanted to try again to build a company with global impact, uprooted their lives in Seoul and moved to Silicon Valley to develop the future in VR.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lee said that AmazeVR has been developing VR technologies since 2015 and pivoted fully into VR concerts in late 2019. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company believed in the need for a more immersive music experience through VR concerts even before the pandemic; however, the music industry felt a bit distant and skeptical, largely from a concern over cannibalization of live concerts, their most lucrative revenue stream, Lee said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More recently, the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the adoption in the market, allowing AmazeVR to find product-market fit quickly. As the music industry also became more open-minded about new technologies, people began to realize that VR concerts are not live concerts but a new category of entertainment, Lee continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The music industry is due for a paradigm shift, and many companies have been trying to innovate the next big thing. The pandemic only accelerated this shift as we’ve seen many endeavors spanning from livestreams to virtual concerts to Fortnite shows,” Lee told TechCrunch. “All of these other solutions only provide incremental value from what already exists, and no other solution truly captures the cover value for fans &#8212; a human connection.” </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AmazeVR is rolling out its first commercial VR concert with 3X Grammy winner Megan Thee Stallion to tour select AMC Theatres across the U.S. this spring. Lee told TechCrunch that the company has already secured its second artist, a global A-list artist, and is finalizing the third artist. Its first VR concert tour springs from years of R&amp;D that resulted in proprietary 9K cameras and software that can automate complex unreal engine-based VR concert visual effects (VFX) modules and run more than 100 headsets at a time. The startup plans to scale its content creation, releasing new VR concerts weekly by 2024 to both in-theater and at-home viewers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“You really need to experience our VR concerts to get a full grasp of how impactful they are. VR can finally blow all 2D experience out of the water. Thanks to our technology, we can evoke a real sense of presence you can’t get from a screen, the feeling that your favorite artist is right here, face to face with you,” Lee said. “This opens up a new dimension for music, one of the first new ways for artists and fans to connect since recordings appeared. We’re thrilled that investors are grasping this and are supporting us as we innovate and grow.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.foxtrotco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxtrot</a> is changing the way we think about convenience stores, and just picked up $100 million in new Series C funding to expand its brick-and-mortar footprint to 50 new retail locations in the next two years.</p>
<p>We last looked in on Chicago-based Foxtrot in early 2020, just before the world was shook by the global pandemic. It had secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/foxtrot-picks-up-17-million-to-reimagine-the-convenience-store/">$17 million in a growth round</a> and was offering customers the option to buy in-store or order online for delivery and had retail stores in Dallas and Chicago.</p>
<p>The company, founded by Mike LaVitola and Taylor Bloom in 2014, is reimagining the corner convenience store. Its origins are as a digital-first commerce platform, but went on to add a retail experience. It is now seeking the best food items by local artisans in addition to Foxtrot’s core offerings of coffee, ready-to-eat cafe meals and wine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After the previous round, Foxtrot added Washington, D.C. to its market list and has since opened 16 retail locations across those three cities. Its offerings include five-minute pickup, rapid and on-demand delivery and its Foxtrot Anywhere nationwide shipping tool.</p>

<p>In addition, the company got into private label products a year ago, which now account for about 30% of its retail offerings and nearly half of its retail and e-commerce sales, CEO LaVitola told TechCrunch. He expects some 200 new private label products to be launched over the next year.</p>
<p>Today’s new fundraise was led by D1 Capital Partners, which was joined by existing investors Monogram Capital, Imaginary, Almanac, Wittington, Fifth Wall, Beliade, Lerer Hippeau and Revolution. The Series C gives Foxtrot total funding of $160 million.</p>
<p>As we saw with the pandemic, most sales shifted online; however, LaVitola noticed that traffic into Foxtrot’s retail locations went up, noting that it was a less intense way of discovering a new snack food and “became a 20-minute joy in people’s routines” versus going into a restaurant or grocery store.</p>
<p>The company doubled its business last year, and the adoption of the retail store is also one of the drivers for the company to use the new funds to open 25 new stores in 2022. New locations will include Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood, the debut of two stores in Austin and additional Chicago openings — Willis Tower, Tribune Tower and near Wrigley Field. In 2023, Foxtrot will take that farther into new markets, like New York, Nashville and Miami, while also expanding its footprint across current cities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The biggest trend we have seen is customers fully leaning into the retail experience and for that to be the main customer acquisition point for the online business,” LaVitola said. “Delivery is here to stay, but customers are ultimately seeing the value of our merchandise. As a result, we are spending 90% of our time on that in-person experience, obsessing over who has the best donuts, coffee or tortillas.”</p>
<p>In addition to the retail locations, Foxtrot is investing the new capital into scaling its merchandising model, hiring additional engineering talent with plans to triple the team’s size in the next year. LaVitola also expects to hire in logistics, store payments, inventory management, personalization and Perks, Foxtrot’s loyalty program.</p>
<p>Perks itself has grown more than 110% in 2021, while its five-minute market pickup and cafe orders grew 250% and 375%, respectively, in the same time period.</p>
<p>Jared Stein, co-founder of Monogram Capital and a Foxtrot board member, called Foxtrot a “category killing model” in the way it’s been able to dominate as an omnichannel brand and local product curator.</p>
<p>“Foxtrot, in our minds, is rare,” he added. “They built their tech stack from the ground up, and it is hard to find another company with the same level of curation and local partnership with interesting brands. That is a reason for people to come into the story. Others are doing this, but with complications. Foxtrot worked on that before scaling it out.”</p>
