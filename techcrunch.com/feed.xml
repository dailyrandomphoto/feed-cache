<p>Precisely when the downtime began is not clear, though problems amongst the TechCrunch staff began a little after ten o&#8217;clock in the morning. Slack itself <a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1">posted</a> at 10:14 am Eastern Time that there was a problem:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2091951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="251" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png 685w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png?resize=680,251 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-10.19.11-AM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Downtime issues are not new for the workplace chat application that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/slacks-share-price-and-the-future-of-direct-listings/">went public in mid-2019</a>, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">announcing a deal</a> to sell itself to Salesforce towards the end of 2020. TechCrunch covered the service&#8217;s uptime issues in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/slack-is-currently-fixing-performance-issues-that-prevented-some-users-from-connecting/">2020</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/yes-slack-is-down-2/">2019</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/slack-is-down-take-the-rest-of-the-day-off/">2018</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/slack-is-still-down-and-its-past-5-oclock-so-go-home/">2017</a>, and so forth.</p>
<p>The downtime is embarrassing as Slack is in the midst of selling itself for a hefty check. For a service designed to help folks work, falling apart precisely when the users &#8212; customers! &#8212; you serve are trying to gear back up for a working year is simply awful.</p>
<p>I suppose we can call one another until Slack is back up.</p>
<p>To close, here&#8217;s the view from Redmond, with its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/10/28/microsoft-teams-reaches-115-million-dau-plus-a-new-daily-collaboration-minutes-metric-for-microsoft-365/">competing Teams product</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industrial sensor giant Teledyne is set to acquire sensing company FLIR in a deal valued at around $8 billion in a mix of stock and cash, pending approvals with an expected closing date sometime in the middle of this year. While both companies make sensors, aimed primarily at industrial and commercial customers, they actually focus on different specialties that Teledyne said in a <a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx">press release</a> makes FLIR&#8217;s business complimentary to, rather than competitive with, its existing offerings.</p>
<p>FLIR&#8217;s technology has appeared in the consumer market via add-on thermal cameras designed for mobile devices, including the iPhone. These are useful for things like identifying the source of drafts and potential plumbing leaks, but the company&#8217;s main business, which includes not only thermal imaging, but also visible light imaging, video analysts and threat detection technology, serves deep-pocketed customers including the aerospace and defense industries.</p>
<p>Teledyne also serves aerospace and defense customers, including NASA, as well as healthcare, marine and climate monitoring agencies. The company&#8217;s suite of offerings include seismic sensors, oscilloscopes and other instrumentation, as well as digital imaging, but FLIR&#8217;s products cover some areas not currently addressed by Teledyne, and in more depth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venmo this morning announced it will begin to offer a new check cashing service, &#8220;Cash a Check,&#8221; in the Venmo mobile app. The feature, which is being rolled out to select users starting today, can be used to cash printed, payroll and U.S. government checks, including the new stimulus checks, the company says. Though typically there will be fees associated with the Cash a Check feature, Venmo says these are being waived on stimulus funds for a limited time.</p>
<p>To be eligible to use Cash a Check, Venmo customers will need to have either Direct Deposit or a Venmo Debit Card enabled on their account, location services turned on, and a verified email address.</p>
<p>Customers who gain access to the feature will then be able take a picture of their endorsed check and send it to the Venmo app to review, much like they would if cashing a check in a mobile banking app. The check will be reviewed in a few seconds, though in special circumstances, the review may take several minutes or even up to an hour before the approval decision is made.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If approved, the money will be immediately transferred to the customer&#8217;s Venmo account.</p>
<p>Venmo will temporarily waive fees on stimulus checks rolling out now and over the next couple of weeks, but eventually 1% fees will apply to any government or payroll check cashed in the app with a pre-printed signature, with a minimum fee of $5.00. Other checks, including hand-signed payroll and government checks, will have a 5% check cashing fee, or $5.00 minimum, according to <a href="https://www.ingomoney.com/partners/paypal-terms-conditions/">PayPal&#8217;s terms</a>.</p>
<p>At launch, the Cash a Check service is provided by <a href="https://www.ingomoney.com/partners/paypal-terms-conditions/">partners</a> First Century Bank, N.A. and Ingo Money, Inc. Ingo Money already offers a similar feature to Venmo parent company, PayPal, to allow users <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/how-do-i-use-the-ingo-money-cash-a-check-service-in-the-paypal-app-faq3726">to cash checks in the PayPal app. </a></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re always looking for new ways to make it easier for our community to access and manage their money, especially as people continue to experience financial hardships amidst the global pandemic,&#8221; said Darrell Esch, Venmo SVP and GM, in a statement about the new service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that with health and safety top of mind for many, having a safe way to access stimulus payments is essential for many of our customers, especially those who are receiving paper checks and traditionally would have to visit a physical check-cashing location,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By introducing the Venmo Cash a Check feature, we are not only enabling our customers to access their money quickly and safely from the comfort of their own homes but are also waiving all fees for cashing government issued checks to ensure customers can use their stimulus funds to pay for the things they need most,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s move into check cashing doesn&#8217;t make the peer-to-peer payment app an alternative to online banking, however. Instead, it serves largely as a way for Venmo to benefit from the influx of stimulus payments that are rolling out now to its U.S. users.</p>
<p>Fintech companies have been scrambling to <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/04/15/fintech-coronavirus-stimulus-checks-loans-paypal-square-chime-stripe-sofi/">prove their worth</a> to customers by offering faster and easier access to stimulus payments. Banking startups like Current and Chime, for example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-startups-rush-to-get-stimulus-payments-out-11609433367">began sending out payments</a> to customers ahead of other traditional banking institutions.</p>
<p>In addition, the stimulus funds can help boost Venmo&#8217;s bottom line beyond just the fees it charges. As Venmo users gain access to their stimulus payments or payroll in the app, they may then use that money to make transactions with online merchants or with their Venmo debit card. This transactions allow Venmo to make money through transaction fees, as well.</p>
<p>Venmo said the feature is rolling out now to mobile app users on iOS and Android. The company recommends users download the latest version of the app and updated to the latest operating system on their mobile device for the best performance.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and don’t forget to check out the second of our two holiday eps, the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/the-equity-crew-predicts-whats-to-come-in-2021/">looking at what we think might happen this year</a>.</p>
<p>What did we get into today? A great question. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/02/tesla-delivers-nearly-500000-vehicles-in-2020/">reported pretty strong deliveries</a>, as did <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/chinese-electric-car-start-up-nio-doubles-deliveries-as-tesla-competition-rises.html">smaller electric vehicle companies</a>. What the strong figures could mean for startups, however, remains to be seen.</li>
<li>Bitcoin had a pretty good end to the year, which could bolster <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">Coinbase&#8217;s impending IPO</a>.</li>
<li>Hundreds of workers at Alphabet want to unionize.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/chinese-ride-hailing-giant-didi-plans-usd80-billion-ipo-this-year">Didi could go public this year</a>, which means we could see a <em>third</em> ride-hailing company provide us access to its numbers. Please!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">CRED raised $81 million in a huge Series C</a>. Our reporting indicates that the company is now worth more than $800 million.</li>
<li>Disco, a legaltech startup, has <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/12/disco-receives-40m-debt-financing-closes-100m-q4-funding-round.html">raised $40 million in debt to cap off a $100 million round</a>.</li>
<li>And here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">the Seed link, as promised</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we&#8217;re still making sure that our brains still work and that the return of work really is here. Taking a break was nice. Now the news is coming back, so we are as well. Hugs, and chat Thursday.</p>

<p>The new financing round &#8212; a Series E &#8212; is slated to be larger than $200 million with Google alone financing more than $100 million of it, four sources said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. The round values ShareChat at more than $1 billion, two of the sources said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as well as a couple of other existing investors are also engaging to participate in the round. ShareChat, Google, and Snap did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ShareChat has raised about $264 million to date and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indias-sharechat-raises-40-million-says-its-short-video-platform-moj-now-reaches-80-million-users/">valued at nearly $700 million last year</a>.</p>
<p>The terms of the deal could change and the talks may not materialize into an investment, the sources cautioned. Local TV channel ET Now reported last year that Google was in talks to acquire ShareChat.</p>
<p>ShareChat’s marquee and eponymous app caters to users in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns. Twitter and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on the other hand, are struggling to gain users beyond urban cities in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. Both Twitter and Snapchat have about 50 million monthly active users in India, according to a popular mobile insight firm.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat, said the app was growing &#8220;exponentially&#8221; and that users were spending, on an average, more than 30 minutes on the app each day.</p>
<p>If the deal goes through, it would be the first investment from Snapchat&#8217;s parent company into an Indian startup. Google, on the other hand, has been on a spree of late. The Android-maker last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">invested in DailyHunt and InMobi&#8217;s Glance</a>, both of which operate short-video apps.</p>
<p>Like the two, ShareChat also operates a short-video app. Its app, called Moj, had amassed more than 80 million monthly active users as of September last year, the startup said at the time.</p>
<p>Last year, Google announced that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">invest $10 billion in India</a> over the course of five to seven years. Days later, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">invested $4.5 billion in Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms</a>. Google and Facebook, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms last year</a>, reach more than 400 million users in the country.</p>
<p><em>More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A UK district court judge has refused to extradite <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wikileaks" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wikileaks">WikiLeaks <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder Julian Assange to the US.</p>
<p>In a hearing at Westminster Magistrates&#8217; Court this morning, Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied the extradition on grounds that Assange is a suicide risk and extradition to the US prison system would be oppressive, given the likely impact on his fragile mental health.</p>
<p>The US, which has been seeking to bring Assange to the country to put him on trial for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/arrested-wikileaks-founder-is-now-facing-u-s-extradition/">conspiracy to hack</a> as well as a number of charges under the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/julian-assange-espionage-act/">Espionage Act</a>, has said it will appeal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The case has been seen as a pivotal test of press freedoms and freedom of expression vs state power.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: UK judge rules against extradition of Assange to US <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssangeCase?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssangeCase</a></p>
<p>&mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1346049008314298368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange/">judgement</a> Baraitser dismissed a number of other defence arguments against Assange&#8217;s extradition but concurred with clinical testimony that he is a suicide risk and that he possesses the intellect to circumvent measures that could be taken to prevent him taking his own life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am satisfied that the risk that Mr. Assange will commit suicide is a substantial one,&#8221; she writes in the 132-page judgement, discussing the testimony of a number of psychiatrists during last year&#8217;s extradition hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I accept that oppression as a bar to extradition requires a high threshold. I also accept that there is a strong public interest in giving effect to treaty obligations and that this is an important factor to have in mind. However, I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that the mental condition of Mr. Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The judgement orders Assange&#8217;s immediate release although at the time of writing the WikiLeaks founder remains in custody &#8212; pending a bail hearing.</p>
<p>The US has 14 days to lodge an appeal.</p>
<p>Assange, who (self) incarcerated in the Embassy of Ecuador in London between 2012 and 2019 to avoid a warrant against him, was arrested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-in-london-after-ecuador-withdraws-asylum/">last year</a> after Ecuador withdrew his diplomatic asylum.</p>
<p>He was found guilty in a UK court of breaching bail conditions and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/julian-assange-jailed-for-50-weeks-for-breaching-uk-bail-conditions/">sentenced to 50 weeks</a>.</p>
<p>The US immediately said it would seek his extradition on its separate roster of charges &#8212; which relate to how the WikiLeaks founder obtained and published classified information leaked to it by former army intelligence analyst and whistleblower, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/chelsea-manning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="chelsea-manning">Chelsea Manning</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A spokesman for the Justice Department confirmed its intention to appeal, sending us this statement: &#8220;While we are extremely disappointed in the court’s ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised. In particular, the court rejected all of Mr. Assange’s arguments regarding political motivation, political offense, fair trial, and freedom of speech. We will continue to seek Mr. Assange’s extradition to the United States.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of more than 200 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Alphabet workers have announced their efforts to form a union. With the help of Communication Workers of America Union&#8217;s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA), the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a> seeks to be open to both employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Of the roughly 227 workers who have so far signed on to support the union, they have all committed to set aside 1% of the yearly compensation to go toward union dues. The bulk of the workers who have signed on are mostly based in offices in the San Francisco Bay Area and one in Cambridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is historic—the first union at a major tech company by and for all tech workers,&#8221; Dylan Baker, a software engineer at Google, said in a statement. &#8220;We will elect representatives, we will make decisions democratically, we will pay dues, and we will hire skilled organizers to ensure all workers at Google know they can work with us if they actually want to see their company reflect their values.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Efforts to unionize at Google and Alphabet come following the creation of unions at tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/">Glitch</a> early last year. Additionally, workers at <a href="https://qz.com/work/1715438/google-contract-workers-unionize-at-hcl-in-pittsburgh/">HCL Technologies workers who contract for Google in Pittsburgh</a> and tech company cafeteria workers in the Bay Area formed unions last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have an industry of workers &#8212; the new generation of workers and the industry, especially tech and games, has been growing exponentially with young people,&#8221; CODE-CWA union organizer Wes McEnany previously told TechCrunch about why we&#8217;re seeing more tech companies organize. &#8220;Some of them make a lot of money and are working at companies that do really bad things. I think they&#8217;re at a position socially where they&#8217;re like enough is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google has been at the center of a plethora of labor issues over the past few years. Between the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/google-employees-walkout-across-the-globe/">the Google walkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/google-employees-are-staging-a-sit-in-to-protest-reported-retaliation/">the reported retaliation against organizers of the walkout</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/google-ceo-says-company-will-review-events-leading-up-to-dr-timnit-gebrus-departure/">recent departure of Dr. Timnit Gebru</a>, it should come as no surprise that folks at the company decided to make their organizing efforts more official.</p>
<p>In a press release, workers also pointed to how more than half of the people who work at Alphabet companies are contract workers and therefore lack many benefits. Additionally, workers take issue with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/google-paid-105-million-to-two-executives-accused-of-sexual-harassment/"> hefty payout packages to executives accused of harassment,</a> as well as with some of the company&#8217;s government contracts, such a s the one around military drone targeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/">just last month</a>, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Google alleging the company violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</a>.</p>
<p>The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged “its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,” the complaint stated.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the reasons why workers want to unionize and gain the legal right to collectively bargain over workplace conditions. Still, there is a lot that needs to happen before Alphabet Workers Union fully comes into fruition. As of right now, the 227 or so workers still need to get other Google and Alphabet workers on board in order to reach a strong majority of people in favor the union. As of September 30, 2020, Alphabet employed 132,121 people. The next step is then seeking recognition from Alphabet.</p>
<p>That last part can be difficult. Case in point: Kickstarter. When workers asked for voluntary recognition from Kickstarter in 2019, the company&#8217;s leadership refused to do so, despite workers having majority support. Instead, <a href="https://www.opeiu.org/Home/NewsandMedia/TabId/2838/ArtMID/4815/ArticleID/1784/Kickstarter-Refuses-Employees%E2%80%99-Request-to-Recognize-Union.aspx">Kickstarter leadership forced workers</a> to have a formal election with the National Labor Relations Board. It all worked out for Kickstarter workers in the end but it took about ten months from going public with its efforts to being recognized as the Kickstarter Union. Once official, Alphabet Workers Union will be part of CWA Local 1400.</p>
<p>&#8220;This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,” Nicki Anselmo, a program manager at Google, said in a statement. &#8220;From fighting the ‘real names’ policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who’ve committed sexual harassment, we’ve seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively. Our new union provides a sustainable structure to ensure that our shared values as Alphabet employees are respected even after the headlines fade.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a> is kickstarting the new year on a high note.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup, led by high-profile entrepreneur <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/kunal-shah-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="kunal-shah-2">Kunal Shah, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Monday it has raised $81 million in a new financing round and bought shares worth $1.2 million (about 90 million Indian rupees) from employees.</p>
<p>The Series C financing round, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/india-cred-raises-80-million-funding/">first reported by TechCrunch in late November</a>, was led by DST Global. Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Tiger Global, and General Catalyst also participated in the round, and so did a few new names including Satyan Gajwani of Indian conglomerate Times Internet, Sofina, and Coatue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round gave <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cred-6ab0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cred-6ab0">CRED <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which operates an eponymous app to reward customers for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">paying their credit card bill on time</a> and offers deals from interesting online brands &#8212; a post-money valuation of $806 million.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Shah said that about 10 percent of CRED’s captable is currently allocated to employees and those who held vested stocks were eligible to sell up to 50 percent of their shares back to the startup in its first ESOP liquidity program. &#8220;We believe that startups should think about creating wealth for every shareholder, including employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>CRED has nearly doubled its customer base to about 5.9 million in the past year, or about 20 percent of the credit card holder base in India. The startup said that the median credit score of its customer was about 830, and about 30 percent of its customer base today holds a premium credit card. (On a side note, more than 50 percent of CRED customers pay their bills using UPI.)</p>
<p>CRED is one of the most talked about startups in India, in part because of the scale at which its valuation has soared and the amount of capital it has been able to raise in such a short period.</p>
<p>One of the biggest questions surrounding CRED today is just how it makes money, given how most fintech startups in the country today &#8212; and there are many of them &#8212; are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">struggling to find a business model</a>.</p>
<p>Shah said CRED makes money by cross-selling financing products &#8212; for which it has a revenue-sharing arrangement with banks and other financial institutions &#8212; and levies a similar cut from merchants who are on the platform today. More than 1,300 brands including big names Starbucks, TAGG, Eat.Fit, Nykaa, and emerging premium direct-to-consumer brands such as The Man Company, Sleepy Cat, and Crossbeats have joined the platform in recent years.</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer market in India is still in its nascent stage, though <a href="https://truegrit.substack.com/p/d2c-social-commerce-and-saas-three">some estimates</a> say it could be worth $100 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we were very deliberate to make D2C happen. It just so happened that in the early days when we offered rewards for D2C brands, they started to see huge traction,&#8221; he said, adding that CRED drove more than 30 percent sales for some brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that we were able to solve the discovery problem for customers. We are approaching this with themes &#8212; work-from-home and coffee &#8212; and it&#8217;s working out well. We are now playing matchmaking role between customers and brands that otherwise had to spend a lot of money in marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the biggest propositions of CRED is that it has been able to court some of the most sought-after customers in India. Unlike many other startups and giants such as Google and Facebook, CRED is not going after the next billion users.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 20 million customers account for 90 percent of all online consumption in India. These are the customers we are focusing on,&#8221; said Shah, who previously ran financial services firm Freecharge and delivered one of the rare successful exits in the country. The core challenge in chasing customers in smaller cities and towns in India is that very few people have the financial capacity to buy things, Shah said.</p>
<p>For that model to work, the GDP of India &#8212; where the average annual income of an individual is about $2,000 &#8212; needs to grow. And for that, we need more participation from females, said Shah. Less than 10 percent of the female population in India are currently part of the workforce, compared to over 90 percent in China.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://twitter.com/sajithpai/status/1343953446030872576">interesting use case</a> for CRED today is that it could potentially license data about the traction D2C brands are seeing on its platform to venture firms, who could use it as a signal to inform their investment decisions.</p>
<p>Shah cautioned that the startup is &#8220;extraordinarily sensitive about data&#8221; but said the team is thinking about ways to help venture firms discover these firms. &#8220;We are planning to create a newsletter to showcase many of these brands to the investor world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And finally, will CRED launch a credit card or other banking products? &#8220;Can we partner with banks to cross-sell every product that they today offer? The answer is yes,&#8221; said Shah, though he cautioned that the startup is in no hurry to supercharge its offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle is heating up between <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its Chinese challenger Xpeng as the latter makes clearer its stance on the future of autonomous driving. Over the weekend, Xpeng, which counts Xiaomi and Alibaba among its investors, <a href="https://www.livoxtech.com/news/14">announced</a> that it will be using lidar sensors from Livox, a startup with closes ties to the Chinese drone giant DJI.</p>
<p>The choice of remote sensing technology lidar and a Chinese supplier reflects the complexities of the U.S.-China tech war. Tesla has accused Xpeng of alleged intellectual property theft, a claim that the Chinese electric vehicle maker repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/19/china-ev-xpeng-500-million/">denied</a>. In a turn that surprises some industry experts, Xpeng <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329812658829324304?lang=en">said</a> it will be adding lidar to its mass-produced autonomous cars in 2021, a strategy that would differentiate it from Tesla. Having seen Xpeng&#8217;s announcement, Elon Musk scoffed that Xpeng lacks Tesla&#8217;s technology.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk has long dismissed the use of lidar in autonomous driving, calling the technology &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">expensive sensors that are unnecessary</a>.&#8221; Instead, Tesla relies on neural network training and camera-enabled visual recognition for its autonomous vehicles. Some Chinese players agree with Musk&#8217;s vision. Daimler-backed Momenta, for instance, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">betting on</a> less expensive millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras.</p>
<p>Xpeng already utilizes several sources to collect data: camera, millimeter-wave radar, ultrasonic, among other sensors. The addition of lidar, it says, will &#8220;provide a greater level of safety redundancy,&#8221; which allows a self-driving car to continue operating even when the primary system component fails, &#8220;by allowing more accurate imaging of the road situation.&#8221; Lidar will also &#8220;enhance target detection, measurement accuracy, performance in low ambient light and other challenging perception conditions,&#8221; the company claims.</p>
<p>The choice of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/livox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="livox">Livox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is also intriguing. There are mature foreign options such as Velodyne and Luminar, but Xpeng&#8217;s pick is expected given the Chinese government&#8217;s push for technological autonomy in key industries. In China, Livox faces some strong opponents like <a href="https://www.hesaitech.com/en/about">Hesai</a>, which is backed by Bosch and Chinese search giant Baidu, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robosense/company_financials">Robosense</a>, which has fundings from state-backed carmakers BAIC and SAIC.</p>
<p>Livox itself was founded as an &#8220;independent company&#8221; in 2016 through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> internal incubation program, according to the startup&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-showcases-wide-product-portfolio-at-ces-2020">description</a>. One of its selling points has been to lower the price point of lidar, which the company claims is made possible by its unique<a href="https://www.livoxtech.com/news/4"> optoelectronic scanning method</a>.</p>
<p>The foray into autonomous driving is fitting as DJI has been pivoting to B2B businesses like agriculture drones. But the giant&#8217;s relationship with the lidar startup remains mystic, at least from the public viewpoint. Livox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-showcases-wide-product-portfolio-at-ces-2020">company boilerplate</a> states it is &#8220;backed by DJI&#8217;s deep expertise in sensor innovation and hardware manufacturing&#8221; and its products are sold through <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/livox-horizon-lidar">DJI&#8217;s official retail store</a>. Other than that, it hasn&#8217;t addressed whether DJI holds any equity in it or has controlling power over its management.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Livox is &#8220;just a team within DJI, which was later positioned as a separate company&#8221; while enjoying access to DJI resources including manufacturing and supply chain &#8220;just like another product brand,&#8221; a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>One possible motive for Livox&#8217;s deliberate distancing from DJI is to avoid potential scrutiny from the U.S. government, which sees lidar as a key area in the tech war with China, the person said. DJI was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">recently added</a> to the U.S. government&#8217;s trade blacklist, which has sanctioned other Chinese tech titans like Huawei and SenseTime from accessing key components from U.S. suppliers. Frank Wang, founder and chief executive of DJI, is also believed to want less public attention.</p>
<p>Livox and DJI couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tmytek.com/">TMYTEK</a> recently raised a Series A+ round of about $10 million for products that make it easier to test 5G millimeter wave equipment. So far, the company’s clients include KDDI, NTT DoCoMo and research institutions. But the Taiwanese startup has aspirations to sell its own base stations, too, competing with well-established players like Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. TMYTEK plans to use its expertise, gleaned from helping other researchers develop 5G infrastructure, to create what its chief executive officer describes as a &#8220;complete 5G industrial chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its latest funding round was led by TMYTEK’s manufacturing partner Inventec, one of the largest OEMs in Taiwan, and brings the startup’s total funding so far to $13.3 million. Other investors included Taisic Materials, ITEQ, Tamagawa Electronics, and Taiwan’s National Development Fund. TMYTEK also recently took part in SparkLabs Taipei’s accelerator program.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Su-Wei Chang told TechCrunch that it plans to raise a Series B next to develop and commercialize its base stations. To get ready for its base station business, TMYTEK recently joined the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org">O-RAN Alliance</a>, founded by some of the world’s biggest telecoms to create more interoperable mobile networks, in a bid to encourage the development of new technology and faster deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chang said TMYTEK’s base in Taiwan gives it a strategic advantage. 5G manufacturing is an important part of Taiwan’s economy, with exports <a href="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2020/12/taiwan-telecom-industry-enters-5g/">reaching record highs during the second half of 2020</a>, thanks in part to demand for 5G-related equipment and technology for smartphones, autonomous vehicles and smart devices.</p>
<p>Chang studied at University of Massachusetts Amherst and when TMYTEK was founded six years ago, he was often asked why he didn’t stay in the United States, where it would have been easier to secure startup funding. But being in Taiwan puts the company closer to many important markets, including Japan, where 30% of its current business comes from, and gives TMYTEK a good foundation to expand into the U.S. and European market, he said.</p>
<p>It has also given the company a supply chain advantage. TMYTEK has manufacturing partners across Asia, including Inventec in Taiwan, and factories in Vietnam and Thailand, in addition to China. Chang said this means TMYTEK was not limited by the COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S-China trade war.</p>
<p>Before launching TMYTEK in 2014, Chang and co-founder Ethan Lin both worked at Academia Sinica, one of the top research institutions in Taiwan, where they focused on millimeter waves even though at the time most researchers were more interested in the mid-band spectrum.</p>
<p>But as more devices and applications began to crowd the 4G spectrum, mmWave became less niche. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna">Qualcomm’s launch</a> of next-generation 5G mmWave hardware and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/qualcomm-announces-the-new-snapdragon-888-chip/">chips</a>, and more carriers launching mmWave coverage, mmWave is poised to become mainstream.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="V52tHQGoMT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna/">Qualcomm launches its next-gen 5G modem and mmWave antenna</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Qualcomm launches its next-gen 5G modem and mmWave antenna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/qualcomm-launches-its-next-gen-5g-modem-and-mmwave-antenna/embed/#?secret=V52tHQGoMT" data-secret="V52tHQGoMT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Millimeter waves offer powerful signals with wide bandwidth and low latency, but drawbacks include difficulty traveling through obstacles like buildings. It also has a limited range, which is why millimeter waves need more base stations. Beamforming, which directs signals toward a specific device, and antenna array, or multiple antennas that work like a single antenna, are used to extend its coverage.</p>
<h2>Making mmWave development faster</h2>
<p>One of the main challenges for the millimeter wave market, however, is the lack of R&amp;D tools to speed up their development and time to market, resulting in higher costs and slower deployment.</p>
<p>To keep up with market opportunities, TMYTEK transitioned from design and manufacturing projects for clients to offering 5G-focused solutions like the BBox, which stands for &#8220;beamforming box.&#8221; The BBox was created after a professor at National Taiwan University told Chang that his team was working on antenna design, but didn’t have the resources to work on beamforming technology, too. It lets researchers create 16 beams and control the signal&#8217;s amplitude and phase with software, so they can test how it works with antennas and other hardware more quickly. TMYTEK claims the BBox can save researchers and engineers up to 80% in time and cost.</p>
<p>Chang said TMYTEK realized that if researchers at NTU, one of Taiwan’s largest research universities, needed a solution, then other labs did, too. So far, it has delivered 30 sets to companies including KDDI, NTT DoCoMo, Fujitsu, several Fortune 500 companies and research institutions.</p>
<p>While the BBox was created for antenna designers, the company also began exploring solutions to help other designers, including algorithm developers who want to test beam tracking, communicate with base stations and collect data.</p>

<p>For that scenario, TMYTEK created the XBeam, which is describes as a &#8220;total solution,&#8221; and is meant for the mass production phase, testing modules, smartphones and base stations before they are shipped. Traditional solutions to test modules rely on mechanical rotators, but Chang said this is more suited to the research and development process. The XBeam, which is based on the BBox, electronically scans beams instead. The company claims the XBeam is up to 20 times faster than other testing solutions.</p>
<p>TMYTEK created the XBeam’s prototype in 2019 and launched the commercialized version in November 2020.</p>
<p>The BBox and XBeam will help TMYTEK build its own base station business in two ways, Chang said. First, having its own solutions will allow TMYTEK to test base stations and bring them to market faster. Second, the startup hopes building a reputation on effective research and development tools will help it market its base stations to private and public networks. This is especially important to TMYTEK’s ambitions since their base stations will be up against products from major players like Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei.</p>
<p>“Our advantage at TMYTEK is that we’re doing the design and we have good partners for manufacturing. Inventec, our investor, is a top five manufacturer in Taiwan,” he said. “And TMYTEK also builds our own testing solution, so our value is that we can provide a total solution to our customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Samsung’s next flagship is set to debut January 14. The company just confirmed earlier rumors surrounding the date for its next Unpacked event (virtually, of course). This one sports the name, &#8220;Welcome to the Everyday Epic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past year, mobile technology has taken center stage in everyday life as people are working remotely and spending more time at home,&#8221; the company writes. &#8220;The accelerated transition to a mobile-first world brings with it the need for devices that can transform everyday life into an extraordinary experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event’s timing is an interesting artifact of 2021’s wacky show scheduling, with the COVID-19 pandemic still very much being front of mind. Past Unpackeds were generally timed around Mobile World Congress. That show has been delayed until the summer, however, in hopes of returning to an in-person event. So Samsung has opted to kickstart sales a month or so earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the event is a mere days after CES. Gone are the days a gadget journalist could take a few days to decompress after the year’s biggest hardware show. It also, perhaps, doesn’t bode well for Samsung’s announcements during CES itself (though the electronics giant has more than enough divisions to keep its presence at the show interesting).</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGTjx0JV_0Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Another odd change this year is the fact that you can already reserve the S21, sight unseen. There’s little doubt it will be a solid phone, though there are plenty of questions around how the company will up the ante in the era of flagging smartphone sales. The leaks so far have been kind of underwhelming, though Samsung’s usually got a couple of fun surprises up its sleeve.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen enough of the Galaxy Buds Pro that they don’t qualify as a surprise, exactly. But the company has a solid enough track record with earbuds that there’s reason to be excited. The AirPods Pro competitors are are said to be priced at a reasonable $199.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/t-mobile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="t-mobile">T-Mobile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the third largest cell carrier in the U.S. after completing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-officially-completes-merger-with-sprint-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-ahead-of-schedule/">its recent $26 billion merger with Sprint</a>, ended 2020 by announcing its second data breach of the year.</p>
<p>The cell giant said <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/security-incident">in a notice buried on its website</a> that it recently discovered unauthorized access to some customers&#8217; account information, including the data that T-Mobile makes and collects on its customers in order to provide cell service.</p>
<p>From the notice: &#8220;Our cybersecurity team recently discovered and shut down malicious, unauthorized access to some information related to your T-Mobile account. We immediately started an investigation, with assistance from leading cybersecurity forensics experts, to determine what happened and what information was involved. We also immediately reported this matter to federal law enforcement and are now in the process of notifying impacted customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Known as customer proprietary network information (CPNI), this data can include call records — such as when a call was made, for how long, the caller&#8217;s phone number and the destination phone numbers for each call, and other information that might be found on the customer&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>But the company said that the hackers did not access names, home or email addresses, financial data, and account passwords (or PINs).</p>
<p>A spokesperson for T-Mobile said the breach happened in early December, and affects about 0.2% of all T-Mobile customers — or approximately 200,000 customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest security incident to hit the cell giant in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2018, T-Mobile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">as many as two million customers</a> may have had their personal information scraped. A year later, the company confirmed hackers accessed records <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/">on another million prepaid customers</a>. Just months into 2020, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/t-mobile-says-hacker-gained-access-to-employee-email-accounts-user-data/">admitted a breach</a> on its email systems that saw hackers access some T-Mobile employee email accounts, exposing some customer data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s fair to say that most people have heard about diversity reports. And it’s probably also fair to say that most of us have watched, sometimes with a metaphorical bucket of buttered popcorn, as companies crisis-comms their ways out of … crises. But most of us do not know what goes on behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getluckie.net/">Mark S. Luckie</a> has an idea. The digital strategist, journalist and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Journalists-Handbook-Mark-Luckie/dp/1450565603/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629885&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3">The Digital Journalist’s Handbook</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DO-U-Mark-Luckie-ebook/dp/B014TBNT9O/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629885&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">DO U</a>,” has written “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Girls-Mark-S-Luckie/dp/0578778564/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+luckie&amp;qid=1609629857&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Valley Girls</a>,” a fictional portrayal of life behind the social curtain at popular tech company Elemynt. Particularly the journey of main character Kelsey Pace, as she navigates life as a communications manager for the company. Having worked in strategy and partnership positions at Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, Luckie tells us he was most interested in exploring how the actual conversations about diversity work inside of tech companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1238543" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1238543" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1238543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?w=300" alt="Valley Girls Author Mark S. Luckie" width="488" height="325" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1238543" class="wp-caption-text">Mark S. Luckie</p></div></p>
<p>“The most that people the most insight that people have is diversity reports, which of course are published from the tech companies, but not an idea of ‘Okay, what&#8217;s really going on?’ And so that&#8217;s what &#8216;Valley Girls&#8217; aims to explore &#8212; what&#8217;s really going on? How bad is diversity? What are the things that are happening or not happening? What is the employee attitude towards it? One of the big narratives is what are the contentions between employees and executives to actually furthering diversity within these companies?”</p>
<p>Tech watchers will read “Valley Girls” and perhaps be able to identify what company drama he is referring to when he mentions this Congressional hearing or that anonymous memo. This, Luckie says, was on purpose.</p>
<p>“It is a merging of the narratives. So yeah, anyone who follows tech or works around tech will be able to … say, ‘Okay, this reminds me of this, it reminds me of this.’ And because like I said, all these experiences are not isolated from each other. They&#8217;re woven into each other.”</p>
<p>With “Valley Girls,” Luckie says he wanted to explore the personal conflict that can emerge while working at one of these companies. He did that and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hellllooooo, 2021! Welcome back to Human Capital, a weekly newsletter that details the latest in the realms of labor, and diversity and inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a ton happened this week so I figured I’d use the time to look back on some of the more notable labor stories of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3><b>Gig workers vs. Uber, Lyft, Instacart et al.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California’s Proposition 22, backed by gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, passed to ensure gig workers are classified as independent contractors. It was an important proposition that resulted in the yes side contributing north of $200 million to its efforts. But the fight isn’t over, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can read about here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon’s stumbles</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon faced a number of labor disputes throughout the year &#8212; many of them involving its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warehouse workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jz7b/amazon-employee-warns-internal-groups-theyre-being-monitored-for-labor-organizing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example: Christian Smalls, a former Amazon warehouse worker, was fired from Amazon in March after organizing a walkout at one of the company’s fulfillment centers in Staten Island. As a result, New York’s attorney general is investigating if Amazon violated federal worker safety laws and New York state’s whistleblower protections laws by firing Smalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smalls’ termination helped galvanize other warehouse workers who later formed an international organization to demand change inside Amazon’s warehouses. Organizers pointed to worker retaliation as one of the driving factors for the formation of Amazon Workers International. Meanwhile, Amazon executives reportedly discussed discrediting Smalls and making him the face of the organizing movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Amazon spokesperson previously told TechCrunch the company did not fire Smalls for organizing a protest. Instead, Amazon said it fired him for “putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of employment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Smalls filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging the company failed to provide PPE to its workers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tech workers unionize </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kickstarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Glitch became two of the first tech companies to unionize. Kickstarter workers voted to unionize in February. A month later, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workers at Glitch voted to unionize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, at least ten tech companies were actively looking to form unions, Grace Reckers, the lead northeast union organizer of OPEIU, told TechCrunch at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employees are seeing that they don’t actually have control of how the products they make are being used,” she said. “Even though most of the messaging in Silicon Valley is about creating a better world for us, making our lives easier and innovating, it also moves under the philosophy of move fast and break things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Disclosure:</em> My partner works at Glitch and serves on the union’s bargaining committee.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pinterest finds itself under heavy scrutiny </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two former Pinterest employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke out about racial and gender discrimination at the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shortly after, Pinterest’s former COO Francoise Brougher </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleging gender discrimination. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/pinterest-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-coo-for-22-5-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest settled the suit for $22.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ozoma and Banks described to me a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher’s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year’s worth of severance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that,” Banks told me.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dr. Timnit Gebru&#8217;s departure from Google makes waves</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Timnit Gebru, a top AI researcher, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she was fired from Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for sending an email to her direct reports discussing how she was disappointed in her organization’s approach to DEI as well as the approval process around her research paper. Gebru sent that email after Google did not grant her permission to attach her and her colleagues&#8217; names to an AI ethics paper about language models. Gebru had previously sent her superiors an email, detailing that if they would not meet her specific conditions she would prepare to leave. Google proceeded to tell her it accepted her resignation and cut off her access to her work email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/google-ceo-says-company-will-review-events-leading-up-to-dr-timnit-gebrus-departure/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google CEO Sundar Pichai said it would review the events leading up to Gebru&#8217;s departure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Pichai’s memo, he said the company needs to “accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily.” He also noted how it’s had a “ripple effect” through underrepresented communities at Google.</span></p>
<h3><b>Alexis Ohanian makes room for Black people at the table</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/alexis-ohanian-steps-down-reddit-board/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped down from the company’s board of directors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, insisting that Reddit replace him with a Black person. Reddit took Ohanian’s advice and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/reddit-names-ycs-michael-seibel-to-board-following-co-founder-alexis-ohanians-exit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Troubles at coworking space The Wing</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1760578" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1760578" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1760578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-944067356.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1760578" class="wp-caption-text">WASHINGTON,DC-APR9: Audrey Gelman, the founder of The Wing, a women&#8217;s only co-working space and organization, April 9, 2018 in Washington, DC.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wing blew up following allegations of racism and other forms of discrimination. Its CEO, Audrey Gelman, resigned as a result and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/the-wing-co-founder-apology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later apologized for not taking any action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/the-wing-co-founder-apology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a note sent to former employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gelman apologized for not taking action to combat mistreatment of women of color at The Wing. She also acknowledged that her drive for success and scaling quickly “came at the expense of a healthy and sustainable culture that matched our projected values, and workplace practices that made our team feel valued and respected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant, Gelman said, The Wing “had not subverted the historical oppression and racist roots of the hospitality industry; we had dressed it up as a kindler [sic], gentler version.”</span></p>

<p>My big question for 2021, and the one that is on every startup&#8217;s mind, is how will a cataclysmic event such as a global pandemic show up in post-pandemic innovation? I think we’re in the early innings of seeing what ‘aha moments’ have materialized into companies. And we won’t know the pandemic’s true impact on our psyches until the dust settles and we have an opportunity to reflect.</p>
<p>We do know it will be fascinating to watch. In 2020, innovators and investors were forced to stand still, and witness cracks, fractures, and rubble in society in a way like never before. It was a humbling year that, for much of the tech community, was mostly spent inside, away, and alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One reaction I’ve noticed so far &#8211; that isn’t necessarily new but comes with new weight &#8211; is a rush of innovation that focuses on reducing friction. Take trends like the rise of building in public or the unbundling of venture capital. Or remote work’s shift from enabling communication to now needing to enable passive and active collaboration. Apply the same idea to mental health, education, and fitness. Heck, we’re even seeing people take the Y Combinator format and apply it to anything that makes sense, from helping operators turn into investors to helping employees try to turn their side gig into a full-time company.</p>
<p>While these movements didn’t begin because of the coronavirus, they all seem to have a huge, pandemic-sized asterisk next to it.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss these movements as small and inconsequential. But, as my colleague and fellow Equity co-host Danny Crichton <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/zfellows-offers-10k-to-stop-what-youre-doing-for-a-week-and-work-on-a-side-project/ ">pointed out this week</a>, “sometimes the most important changes in venture and startups more generally have come from lowering that last bit of friction to action.”</p>
<p>Lowering friction feels like the mantra we all need to enter 2021 with.</p>
<p>I already have hope that innovation will come from a more diverse set of people, whether it’s in a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/theres-no-hacker-house-geared-toward-undergraduate-women-so-they-created-one-of-their-own/ "> hacker house for undergraduate women</a> or a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/develop-for-good-student-volunteers/"> student-founded service that matches undergraduate students to non-profits</a>. So, as we enter the new year &#8212; and bear with me here &#8211; I urge you to be optimistic.</p>
<p>The last year in tech hasn’t left people exhausted and hopeless, it’s left them energized and ready.</p>

<h2><strong>Will second time be the charm for Qualtrics? </strong></h2>
<p>When <strong>SAP</strong> announced that <strong>Qualtrics</strong> was getting spun out in July, the full-circle moment made the Equity podcast crew<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/equity-shot-all-about-the-qualtrics-ipo/"> jump to our mics</a> with guesses around why. Now, months later, there’s a new S-1 filing, and more to color in. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a></strong> broke down the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/equity-shot-all-about-the-qualtrics-ipo/">Utah-based unicorn’s numbers</a>, noting that it’s the second time Qualtrics has filed.</p>
<p>Will the second time be the charm that Qualtrics needs to actually go public this time around? I’ll let you make the call yourself once you sift through Alex’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/"> analysis of the valuation and financials</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Miami, Substack, and Clubhouse</strong></h2>
<p>If those three words in a single subhed elicit a certain reaction from you, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"><strong>Danny Crichton</strong></a> has a bone to pick with you. He wrote a piece this week about tech’s cynicism around anything new, underscoring how<strong> Miami</strong>’s future as a tech hub, <strong>Substack</strong>’s future as a replacement for traditional journalism, and <strong>Clubhouse</strong>’s future as a social media disruptor have come under fire as expected.</p>
<p><em>The cynicism of immediate perfection is one of the strange dynamics of startups in 2020. There is this expectation that a startup, with one or a few founders and a couple of employees, is somehow going to build a perfect product on day one that mitigates any potential problem even before it becomes one. Maybe these startups are just getting popularized too early, and the people who understand early product are getting subsumed by the wider masses who don’t understand the evolution of products?</em></p>
<p>Danny’s argument is to give these companies a little more grace to execute on a vision they themselves are not even close to scratching the surface of. When it comes to holding specific decision-makers and businesses to a certain standard, I prefer a more fluid conversation. But I do agree that writing off a business because it hasn’t done everything correctly from the start can hurt progress. It’s easy to be grumpy, but why not choose to be an optimist?

<h2><strong>And some good news</strong></h2>
<p>Speaking of humbling moments and optimism, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Sarah Perez</a> wrote a piece this week about <strong>EarlyBird</strong>, an app that lets families and friends <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/earlybirds-new-app-lets-families-and-friends-gift-investments-to-children/">gift investments to children.</a> While Acorns and Stash have similar offerings, Earlybird is bringing a fresh UX play to financial literacy, freedom, and education. There’s a ton of work left to be done, hurdles to deal with, and giant unicorns to compete with. EarlyBird, however, is only weeks old so there’s much to watch out for.</p>
<p><strong>VP Caleb Frankel</strong>, now EarlyBird COO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/earlybirds-new-app-lets-families-and-friends-gift-investments-to-children/">explained the early inspiration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This all started with a problem I experienced years ago when my beautiful baby niece was born. I found myself head over heels and spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on just the most ridiculous stuff — pretty much just junk gifts,” he says. “I wanted to have a larger impact in her life and something that she could really use when she grew up.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion total downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019.

In 2019, people <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spent</a> three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, time spent in apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">jumped</a> 25% year-over-year on Android. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week (after a week off for the holidays), we&#8217;re taking a look at holiday app store spending, how the Chinese gaming licensing rules have impacted the App Store, Apple&#8217;s move to ban a party app that could have helped spread COVID, and the collaborative musical created by TikTok users, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h2>Christmas Day app spending grows 35% year-over-year</h2>
<p>Global app spending didn&#8217;t seem to be impacted by the pandemic in 2020, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-christmas-2020">according to data from Sensor Tower.</a> The firm reports that consumers spent $407.6 million in apps from the iOS App Store and Google Play on Christmas Day, 34.5% from the $303 million spent in 2019. The majority of the spending was on mobile games, up 27% year-over-year to $295.6 million. Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings led the games category, while TikTok led non-game apps with $4.7 million in spending on Christmas Day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091741" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091741" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2091741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png 1516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>As in prior years, Apple accounted for the majority of the spending, or 68.4% ($278.6M) vs Google Play&#8217;s $129M. The spending was led by the U.S., who accounted for ~$130 million of the total</p>
<h2>Apple takes a stand on pandemic parties</h2>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store Review guidelines don&#8217;t specifically detail how the company will handle apps that could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, but Apple found a way to draw the line when it came to a social app that encouraged unsafe gatherings. This past week, Apple banned the app Vybe Together, which had allowed people to locate &#8220;secret&#8221; indoor house parties in their area, sometimes including those held in violation of state guidelines.</p>
<p>NYT reporter Taylor Lorenz first called attention to the problem with a <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1343994810714058753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343995285869977600%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2020%2F12%2Fprivate-party-app-pulled-from-app-store-by-apple%2F">tweet</a>. The app had been posting to TikTok to gain attention, but its account has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vybe-together-tiktok-promote-nye-parties-amid-covid-19-2020-12">since been removed</a>. Following its removal, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205298/apple-tiktok-vybe-together-pandemic-underground-party-app-removed">defended itself</a> by saying that it was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">only meant for small get-togethers</a> and the founder <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/were-canceled-liberal-media-inside-020754388.html">lamented</a> being &#8220;canceled by the liberal media.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no good defense, really, for the unnecessary and ill-timed promotion of an app that encouraged people from different households to gather, which spreads COVID. And what the founder seemed to not understand, by nature of his recent tweets and statements on the app&#8217;s <a href="https://vybetogether.com/">website</a>, is that many cities and states also <em>already</em> <em>prohibit</em> small private gatherings of varying degrees, including those <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">he believes are fine</a>, like small parties in folks&#8217; &#8220;own apartments with people in your area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. is coping with 346,000 COVID deaths, and in New York, where the app was promoting NYE parties,<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/cuomo-nearly-74-of-new-covid-19-cases-linked-to-private-gatherings/34944141"> 74% of all COVID-19 cases</a> from Sept.-Nov. 2020 have been linked to private gatherings.</p>
<p>The media may have reported on what the app was doing, but ultimately the decision to &#8220;cancel&#8221; it was Apple&#8217;s. And it was the correct one.</p>
<h2>Apple removes 39K games from its China App Store.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-games-idUSKBN2950P1">Apple on Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020 removed 39,000+ games from China App Store</a>. This was the biggest removal of games in a single day, Reuters reported, citing <a href="https://www.qimai.cn/zhuanlan/article/id/1489">data from Qimai</a>.</p>
<p>iOS games have long been required to obtain a Chinese gaming license in order to operate in the country, but Apple skirted this rule for years by hosting unlicensed titles even as Android app stores complied. Apple began to enforce the rule in 2020 and gave publishers a Dec. 31, 2020 deadline to obtain the license &#8212; a process that can be tedious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Clearly, a large number of publishers were not able to meet the deadline. Included in the new sweep were Ubisoft&#8217;s Assassin’s Creed Identity and NBA 2K20. Qimai says only only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games remained following the removals. To date, Apple purged more than 46,000 titles from the China App Store, the report said.</p>
<h3>TikTok births a &#8220;Ratatousical&#8221;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/12/29/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-stars/">The TikTok musical version of Ratatouille has become a real thing.</a> The pandemic forced a lot of creative types out of work in 2020, leading them to find new ways to express themselves online. On TikTok, this collective pent-up energy turned into a large-scale collaborative event: <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">a musical version</a> of Disney&#8217;s <em>Ratatouille</em>. (Or <em>Ratatousical</em>, as it was nicknamed.) TikTokers composed music, wrote lyrics and dialogue, choreographed dances, designed costumes, sets and more, as they worked together through the app.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Disney is allowing a charity version of this collaboration to become a real event without any interference or lawsuits. The <em>Ratatouille</em> musical <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">live-streamed on Jan. 1 at 7 p.m. Eastern,</a> and will be available via video-on-demand through Jan. 4, for a minimum $5 donation to The Actors Fund.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-9dH9FKqtI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=RD8CYCPVe9NIE' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The musical itself was lighthearted fun for a younger, Gen Z crowd. It also cleverly incorporated actual TikTok videos that featured the app’s well-known visual effects — like cloning yourself or the flashing colored lights typically associated with TikTok’s “you think you can hurt me” meme, for example. That made it more accessible and familiar to kids who had spent the past year being entertained via the internet.</p>
<p>TikTok users, of course, aren&#8217;t the only ones designing, creating and editing productions through remote and collaborative processes in 2020 &#8212; Hollywood itself has had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hollywood-working-home-streaming-video">to reorient itself for remote work at a much larger scale</a>. TikTok was simply the platform of choice for theater kids looking for something to do.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the TikTok-based collaborative process that birthed this musical ultimately becomes a one-off event that arose from the pandemic&#8217;s impacts &#8212; including the ability for many creative people to devote time and energy on side projects, for example, due to shuttered productions and stay-at-home orders. Or perhaps in-app collaborations have a real future? Time will tell.</p>
<p>TikTok has already proven it can drive the music charts, fashion trends, and app downloads, so it can probably generate an audience for this production, as well. But the cynic may wonder if such an event would have been as popular and buzzworthy had it been some entirely original production, rather than one based on already popular and beloved Disney IP.  But you may as well watch &#8212; it&#8217;s not like you have any other plans these days.</p>

Samsung and Epic Games worked together on the &#8220;Free Fortnite&#8221; marketing campaign, which recently involving sending packages to influencers that contained a Free Fortnite bomber jacket and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. Fortnite was the Samsung Galaxy Store game of the year in 2020, and the store also distributes the Epic Games app which distributes the Fortnite updates. This is an odd move as Epic alleges the app stores leverage their power to engage in monopolistic practices, but this makes it clear that Samsung is offering them distribution. Apple has the right to set its own pricing for its services (and it recently lowered commissions for small businesses, too). But even if Epic Games is not the knight in shining armor one would hope for, its lawsuit could help set precedent. And regulators may still decide one day that Apple can&#8217;t dictate rules about how businesses operate outside its app store &#8212; meaning, they should have the right to collect their own payments, for example.</li>

<p>The popular app maker Iconfactory released a new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterscope-weather/id1450116400">Waterscope</a>, that is a weather app more specifically designed to provide users with information on water conditions. Creator Craig Hockenberry <a href="https://furbo.org/2020/12/22/introducing-waterscope/">explains</a> the app is something he largely built for himself, an ocean swimmer often in need of information about the tides, wave heights, water temperature, wind speed, air temperature, forecasts and more. The app could be useful to those who live around the water, whether they&#8217;re swimming, fishing, boating or anything else. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterscope-weather/id1450116400">iOS only</a>.</p>

<p>This endless runner is BuzzFeed&#8217;s first mobile game, which makes it worth noting if not exactly recommending. The mental health-themed game, inspired by BuzzFeed&#8217;s animated series <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIrDZVxDhVh/?utm_source=ig_embed">The Land of Boggs</a>, was created by BuzzFeed Animation Studios. In the game, characters try to avoid things like stress monsters and gremlins, which is a humorous take on the anxieties of 2020. However, early user reviews indicate the game&#8217;s controls are too difficult and complain the game is too hard to be fun. How stressful! $0.99 on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/run-boggo-run/id1544517293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuzzFeed.RunBoggoRun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</p>

<p>Not Facebook&#8217;s Portal! This sleep and relaxation-focused app, also called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560">Portal</a>, has been updated with Apple&#8217;s new privacy measures in mind. The company announced in December it will not collect user data from its app, and will now no longer use any in-app analytics tracking. The app also never required a login or collected personal information, and didn&#8217;t include third-party ads and ad trackers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s resulted in an App Store rare find:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla</a> delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, a 36% increase over the previous year and just a few dozen short of hitting an historic and long-awaited milestone that CEO Elon Musk has been aiming for more than five years.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reported Saturday that it produced 509,737 electric vehicles in 2020.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Tesla was able to reach the 500,000-vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other end-of-the-quarter efforts by the company. Tesla delivered 180,570 in the fourth quarter, setting a new quarterly record and 30% higher than the previous quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the Model Y, its mid-sized SUV, and a new factory coming online in China.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter and annual figures shows the rise in demand for its more affordable and newer models and waning interest in its flagship Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The company delivered 18,920 Model S and Model X vehicles in the fourth quarter and 57,039 for the year. Sales of the Model 3 and Model Y hit nearly 162,000 in the fourth quarter and 442,511 for the year. Tesla doesn&#8217;t break out sales figures for each model, instead combining its older vehicles into one bucket and its newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in another. The company also doesn&#8217;t provide regional sales figures.</p>
<p>Producing and selling more than 500,000 vehicles a year seemed unreachable for Tesla just a handful of years ago. But Musk has taken a bullish view of the company, noting in 2015 that he remained confident that Tesla would be producing half a million cars in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s five years from now,&#8221; Musk said at the time. &#8220;If you go five years in the past for Tesla, we were producing 600 cars per year—now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going from here to 500,000 cars a year is a much smaller leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk has reiterated that target periodically, including in January of last year when he noted that deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units. Tesla didn&#8217;t adjust that forecast even as the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy and forced the company, along with every other automaker, to temporarily pause production for several weeks last spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; was released on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Max on Christmas Day, where it quickly divided the hosts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was predictable that Anthony — a fan of clunky-but-ambitious superhero sequels like &#8220;The Dark Knight Rises&#8221; and &#8220;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#8221; — enjoyed the film. Darrell, meanwhile, took the side of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonder-woman-1984">most critics</a>, who found the movie exasperating and even, at times, mystifyingly bad.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was Jordan, who disliked the first &#8220;Wonder Woman&#8221; and actually preferred the sequel, thanks in large part to Kristen Wiig&#8217;s portrayal of the villainous Cheetah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everyone agreed that there were plenty of problems, including some slipshod and confusing plotting, as well as a portrayal of Wonder Woman that&#8217;s defined entirely by her longing for Steve Trevor, the Chris Pine character who died at the end of the first film but returns here under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>But where Anthony found the overall arc of the film — rewriting the melancholy love story of &#8220;Superman II&#8221; as a parable about capitalism and climate change — and its big emotional moments to be surprisingly affecting, Darrell thought the entire final act was ludicrous, with some of the worst CGI ever seen in a big-budget film.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recently announced the astronauts who will be taking part in the Artemis missions, and among them is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/anne-c-mcclain/biography">Anne McClain</a>, who has spent 203 days in orbit and conducted two spacewalks on the ISS. With the space industry looking nothing like it did 10 years ago and new spacecraft and technologies on the rise, McClain share her thoughts about how she and other astronauts would be embracing the future.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. McClain&#8217;s time aboard the ISS spanned from December 2018 to June of 2019, meaning her ascent and descent were both aboard Russia&#8217;s Soyuz capsules, as astronauts have gotten to and from space since the Shuttle days. The Artemis missions, however, will use a variety of new launch vehicles and spacecraft. And while she didn&#8217;t get to fly a Dragon capsule, she did get to check one out while it was docked at the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so happy to have flown the Soyuz, because it is such a reliable, basic spacecraft — it&#8217;s almost like flying a piece of history — knowing I was going to be able to compare that to other vehicles to in the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had the opportunity when I was on Space Station when DM-1 flew. And so, being able to float into that and look at their screens, their monitors, you notice right away that the technology has advanced to where it looks like the inside of a commercial airliner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were the first to pilot a Dragon in orbit, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/">said afterwards that it was &#8220;certainly different,&#8221;</a> partly due to the reliance on touchscreens as primary interfaces for many spacecraft functions. McClain emphasized the difficulty of getting software to the point where it can be trusted with someone&#8217;s life.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;This is certainly different&#8217;: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/embed/#?secret=8O5e1Sd3yf" data-secret="8O5e1Sd3yf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Most of the vehicles that we&#8217;re using now are very heavy on software — lots of touchscreens, not so much valves that were physically moving, it&#8217;s more like a software relay. But that adds a huge amount of complexity, because as your readers are probably well aware, approving software and the reliability of software is difficult,&#8221; she explained. 	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking at the question of, when should a human be in the loop, and when should it be automated? And if it&#8217;s automated, how can we prove the software has reliability sufficient for human spaceflight? At some point you have to say, &#8216;You know what, if this happens, we&#8217;re going to put a human in the loop,&#8217; just so you&#8217;re not paralyzed by 10 years of software testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a pilot herself, McClain naturally has opinions on this, and like Hurley and Behnken, worked with SpaceX early on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fortunate to work with Bob and Doug, advising SpaceX early on in their cockpit controls, and I think where they got, it&#8217;s a really incredible machine,&#8221; she said, while noting that the Orion and Starliner craft received similar attentions from experts like her.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1996397" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1996397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif" alt="" width="800" height="444" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1996397" class="wp-caption-text">Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley bump fists to celebrate their history-making launch on SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon.</p></div></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 Flexibility was chief among the desired aspects; If things go even a little off script, they need the tools to be flexible and not self-limiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, pilots, we always want options, right? Whatever happens, we want options. As much as we try to predict scenarios on the ground, we&#8217;re always keenly aware that something could happen that wasn&#8217;t predicted, and at that point&#8230; we want <em>options</em>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do. So it&#8217;s really important for me that the software doesn&#8217;t take options off the table. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why, at NASA, they look at the Apollo 13 case, when we had to use hardware and software and the vehicle in ways that we&#8217;d never predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked whether it was different or strange to work with newer companies like Blue Origin, McClain pointed out that really, the only new thing there is the name.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg" alt="CG Render of what Blue Origin and Lockheed's lunar lander is expected to look like." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with these companies enough to know something, and that&#8217;s that yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now, which is exactly what NASA wants to do. That is our human capital,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The other thing I&#8217;m confident about is the way NASA partners with these companies, for test programs and design reviews, it&#8217;s extremely thorough. So by the time that rocket has me on top of it on a pad, I&#8217;m confident in in the checks and balances we have in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			That technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Lastly I asked about whether any conveniences of modern consumer tech had made it more bearable to spend long periods of time in space, for instance the fairly recent capability to do video calls. McClain was quick to answer in the positive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you said is exactly it. Imagine if we were in this pandemic and weren&#8217;t able to video chat — we&#8217;re already feeling disconnected from our loved ones. And you know, feeling disconnected is the same whether you&#8217;re on the other side of the country or you&#8217;re in space. So the ability for us to be able to see our parents&#8217; faces on the screen and talk to them, it really does wonders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just morale. You know, you start looking at six month, twelve month missions, it&#8217;s really maintaining the psyche, maintaining human mental health. So that technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClain is one of 18 astronauts who will take part in the missions leading up to the planned Moon landing. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-team/">You can meet the rest here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Friday that it will launch the PlayStation 5 in India on February 2, suggesting improvements in the supply chain network that was severely impacted last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm said it will begin taking pre-order requests for the new gaming console in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, on January 12. The console will be available for pre-order from a number of retailers including Amazon India, Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital, Games the Shop, Sony Center, and Vijay Sales, the company said.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is priced at Indian rupees 49,990 ($685), while the digital edition of the console will sell at Indian rupees 39,990 ($550). Xbox Series X, in comparison, is priced at $685 in India, and Xbox Series S sells at $480. Both the consoles launched in India in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, much like elsewhere in the world, Microsoft has been struggling to meet the demand for the new Xbox consoles in India. The Xbox Series X is facing so much shortage in the country that it&#8217;s not even easy to locate its page on Amazon India.</p>
<p>The announcement today should allay concerns of loyal PlayStation fans, some of whom &#8212; including, of course, yours truly &#8212; secured a unit from the gray market at a premium in recent months after India was not included in the first wave of nations for the PS5. Fans have also been frustrated at Sony and its affiliated partners for not offering clarification or providing conflicting accounts about the probable launch of the new gaming console in recent months.</p>
<p>In November, Sony suggested that it had delayed the launch of the PS5 in India due to local import regulations. Game news site The Mako Reactor <a href="https://themakoreactor.com/news/ps5-release-date-india-2021-launch-sony/20520/">reported</a> earlier this week that Sony is unlikely to offer warranty and after-sales support for PlayStation 5 accessories in India &#8212; as has been the case for several previous generations.</p>
<p>India is not yet a big market for full-fledged gaming consoles yet. According to industry estimates, Sony and Microsoft sold only a few hundred thousand units of their previous generation consoles in the country. Thanks to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/samsung-beats-xiaomi-to-reclaim-no-1-spot-in-indian-smartphone-market/">proliferation of affordable Android smartphones</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">world&#8217;s cheapest mobile data tariffs</a>, tens of millions of Indians have embraced mobile gaming in recent years.</p>
