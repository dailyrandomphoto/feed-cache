										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weeks after Lime became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">one of the first companies to win the bid to operate e-scooters in New York City</a>, the micromobility giant is bringing e-mopeds to the city&#8217;s streets. This will be the first company to host multiple modes of micromobility sharing in NYC.</p>
<p>On Friday, Lime will release 100 electric mopeds onto the streets of Brooklyn, with planned expansions in Queens and lower Manhattan in the coming weeks. NYC is often choked and heated by smog from car pollution, but if it wants to achieve <a href="https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/achieve-carbon-neutrality-and-100-percent-clean-electricity/">carbon neutrality by 2050</a>, it&#8217;ll have to get comfortable with seeing more electric micromobility crop up.</p>
<p>Lime will be directly competing with the only other existing dockless e-moped operator in the city, Revel, which just announced the launch of an all-EV rideshare service. Lime&#8217;s initial geographic zones of operation will more or less match Revel&#8217;s map, which includes much of north Brooklyn, from Williamsburg, to Greenpoint and Brooklyn Heights, but which will also extend southeast to the Flatlands, according to a Lime spokesperson.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/lime-adds-shared-electric-mopeds-to-the-mix/">Lime also launched e-mopeds in Washington D.C. and Paris</a>. With each launch, Lime has stressed its commitment to rider and road user safety with features like AI-enabled helmet detection and license verification and a liveness test, which asks the rider to make various facial expressions into the camera when signing up in order to prove they&#8217;re a real person, rather than using a static photo of someone else. A spokesperson said Lime can also use the liveness test to match the rider to their driver&#8217;s license to ensure it&#8217;s the same person.</p>
<p>Lime also requires a mandatory rider education curriculum designed in consultation with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, and its service is covered by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automobile-liability-insurance.asp#:~:text=Liability%20car%20insurance%20is%20the,property%20while%20operating%20a%20vehicle.&amp;text=The%20two%20components%20of%20liability,liability%20and%20property%20damage%20liability.">motor vehicle liability insurance</a>, which provides financial protection if a rider were to harm someone else or their property while driving, but not for the rider or rider&#8217;s property.</p>
<p>Competitor Revel learned the hard way to include such safety features. Last summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/electric-moped-startup-revel-returns-to-new-york-with-helmet-selfie-other-in-app-safety-features/">the company took its mopeds off the roads for a few weeks</a> following several deaths and reports that riders weren&#8217;t wearing helmets, in order to come up with a safety plan that would assuage the city&#8217;s fears. Now Revel requires that users take a helmet selfie and requires all riders to take a 21-question safety training quiz and watch an instructional video before hopping on a moped for the first time. The app also has a community reporting tool that anyone can use to report bad behavior to Revel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The steps Lime and Revel are taking to ensure rider safety are not dictated by the NYC Department of Transportation. Whereas the DOT engaged in a lengthy process to approve e-scooters to operate in the city, mopeds are not regulated by the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We made an effort to work collaboratively with DOT, keep them informed of our plans, answer their questions and address any concerns,&#8221; a Lime spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lime will also offer its Lime Aid program to give discounted rates to Pell Grant recipients, job seekers and recipients of subsidy programs, as well as free rides to frontline workers, teachers, non-profit employees, artists and hospitality workers — those who have been most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>As more New Yorkers get vaccinated and the city starts to open up (with a freshly-revealed plan to fully re-open the city by July 1) , Lime wants to entrench itself as a leading micromobility vessel, and they couldn&#8217;t ask for a better time than a post-pandemic summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The pandemic has pushed New Yorkers to look for new ways to get around that are safe, sustainable and car-free,” said Lime CEO Wayne Ting in a statement. &#8220;Now, as New York emerges from a difficult year, we are eager to support an economic comeback driven not by cars, but by sustainable options that reduce congestion and allow for open-air, socially-distanced travel.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today’s app-based or “gig” economy is frequently dressed up in talk about “modern innovation” and the “21st century of work.” This facade is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Precarious, contingent work is nothing new — we’ve always had jobs that are low-paying, insecure and dismissed as “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-low-skill-worker/618674/">unskilled</a>.” Due to systemic racism and a historically exploitative economy, workers of color have always been, and continue to be, heavily concentrated in the most exploitative industries.</p>
<p>The only difference is that today, companies like Uber, DoorDash and Instacart claim they don’t have to play by the rules because they use digital apps to manage their workforce. Even as many of these tech giants remain unprofitable, they have been allowed for far too long to shirk responsibility for providing safe and just working conditions where workers can thrive on and off the job.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Workers’ rights in the so-called gig economy are often positioned as a modern problem. But when we think about the problems faced by gig and app-based workers, who are predominantly people of color, we must learn from the past in order to move forward to a just economy.</p>
<p>The federal government has long failed to address widespread worker exploitation. Since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, jobs like agricultural and domestic work, which were largely performed by workers of color, were carved out of labor rights and protections. The “independent contractors” of today, who are largely workers of color, fall into this same category of workers who have been excluded from labor laws. Combined, Black and Latinx workers make up less than 29% of the nation’s total workforce, but they comprise almost 42% of workers for app-based companies.</p>
<p>Gig companies argue that the drivers, delivery people, independent contractors and other workers who build their businesses, take direction from them and whose pay they set are millions of tiny businesses that do not need baseline benefits and protections. They do this in order to shield themselves from taking responsibility for their frontline workforce. Corporations then avoid paying basic costs like a minimum wage, healthcare, paid sick leave, compensation coverage and a litany of other essential benefits for their employees. For many workers, these conditions only serve to proliferate inequality nationwide and ultimately uphold a deeply flawed economy built upon worker exploitation and suffering.</p>
<p>App-based companies are the face of a larger, sinister trend. Over the last four decades, federal policies have greatly eroded the bargaining power of workers and concentrated more power in the hands of corporations and those who already have substantial wealth and power. This has perpetuated and worsened the racial wage and wealth gaps and contributed to the ever-increasing degradation of working conditions for too many.</p>
<p>It’s clear that, in order to build an economy that works for all people, “gig” and app-based companies cannot be allowed to exploit their workers under the guise of “innovation.” These companies claim their workers want to remain independent contractors, but what workers want is good pay, job security, flexibility and full rights under federal laws. This is a reasonable and just demand &#8212; and necessary to close generational gender and racial wealth gaps.</p>
<p>App-based companies are pouring significant resources into promoting government policies that prop up their worker exploitation model. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash Instacart and other app-based companies are loudly peddling misinformation in state legislatures, city councils and federal offices. Elected leaders at all levels need to recognize these policies for what they are — corporate efforts to rewrite the laws to benefit them — and reject the corporate interests behind the policies that carve out workers from universal protections.</p>
<p>Congress must also reject exclusions that lock people of color out of basic employment protections and pass legislation to extend protections to <em>all workers</em>, including app-based workers. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842">PRO Act</a> is a great first step, which extends bargaining protections to workers who have been wrongly classified as “independent contractors” by their employers.</p>
<p>Across the country, app-based workers have organized to protect their health and safety and demand that their rights as workers be recognized and protected. Elected leaders cannot keep falling for corporate propaganda claiming a “21st-century” model. Work in the 21st century is still work; work that is organized on an app is still work.</p>
<p>We call on Congress to recognize the labor rights and protections of all workers and act boldly to ensure that app-based companies cannot block workers from equal rights in the name of “flexibility” and “innovation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taking on Amazon S3 in the cloud storage game would seem to be a fool-hearty proposition, but <a href="http://wasabi.com">Wasabi</a> has found a way to build storage cheaply and pass the savings onto customers. Today the Boston-based startup announced a $112 million Series C investment on a $700 million valuation.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company led the round with participation from previous investors. It reports that it has now raised $219 million in equity so far, along with additional debe financing, but it takes a lot of money to build a storage business.</p>
<p>CEO David Friend says that business is booming and he needed the money to keep it going. &#8220;The business has just been exploding. We achieved a roughly $700 million valuation on this round, so  you can imagine that business is doing well. We&#8217;ve tripled in each of the last three years and we&#8217;re ahead of plan for this year,&#8221; Friend told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that demand continues to grow and he&#8217;s been getting requests internationally. That was one of the primary reasons he went looking for more capital. What&#8217;s more, data sovereignty laws require that certain types of sensitive data like financial and healthcare be stored in-country, so the company needs to build more capacity where it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>He says they have nailed down the process of building storage, typically inside co-location facilities, and during the pandemic they actually became more efficient as they hired a firm to put together the hardware for them onsite. They also put channel partners like managed service providers (MSPs) and value added resellers (VARs) to work by incentivizing them to sell Wasabi to their customers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=WJHjhC3BjQ" data-secret="WJHjhC3BjQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wasabi storage starts at $5.99 per terabyte per month. That&#8217;s a heck of a lot cheaper <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">than Amazon S3</a>, which starts at 0.23 per gigabyte for the first 50 terabytes or $23.00 a terabyte, considerably more than Wasabi&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>But Friend admits that Wasabi still faces headwinds as a startup. No matter how cheap it is, companies want to be sure it&#8217;s going to be there for the long haul and a round this size from an investor with the pedigree of Fidelity will give the company more credibility with large enterprise buyers without the same demands of venture capital firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fidelity to me was the ideal investor. [&#8230;] They don&#8217;t want a board seat. They don&#8217;t want to come in and tell us how to run the company. They are obviously looking toward an IPO or something like that, and they are just interested in being an investor in this business because cloud storage is a virtually unlimited market opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He sees his company as the typical kind of market irritant. He says that his company has run away from competitors in his part of the market and the hyperscalers are out there not paying attention because his business remains a fraction of theirs for the time being. While an IPO is far off, he took on an institutional investor this early because he believes it&#8217;s possible eventually.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a big enough market we&#8217;re in, and we were lucky to get in at just the right time with the right kind of technology. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that Wasabi could grow to be a fairly substantial public company doing cloud infrastructure. I think we have a nice niche cut out for ourselves, and I don&#8217;t see any reason why we can&#8217;t continue to grow,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity nightmares like the SolarWinds hack highlight how malicious hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities in software and apps to do their dirty work. Today a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help organizations protect themselves from this by running threat detection and response at the network level is announcing a big round of funding to continue its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vectra.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vectra AI</a>, which provides a cloud-based service that uses artificial intelligence technology to monitor both on-premise and cloud-based networks for intrusions, has closed a round of $130 million at a post-money valuation of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The challenge that Vectra is looking to address is that applications &#8212; and the people who use them &#8212; will continue to be weak links in a company&#8217;s security set-up, not least because malicious hackers are continually finding new ways to piece together small movements within them to build, lay and finally use their traps. While there will continue to be an interesting, and mostly effective, game of cat-and-mouse around those applications, a service that works at the network layer is essential as an alternative line of defense, one that can find those traps before they are used.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Think about where the cloud is. We are in the wild west,&#8221; Hitesh Sheth, Vectra&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;The attack surface is so broad and attacks happen at such a rapid rate that the security concerns have never been higher at the enterprise. That is driving a lot of what we are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheth said that the funding will be used in two areas. First, to continue expanding its technology to meet the demands of an ever-growing threat landscape &#8212; it also has a team of researchers who work across the business to detect new activity and build algorithms to respond to it. And second, for acquisitions to bring in new technology and potentially more customers.</p>
<p>(Indeed, there has been a proliferation of AI-based cybersecurity startups in recent years, in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/cado-security-locks-in-10m-for-its-cloud-native-digital-forensics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital forensics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/appomni-raises-40m-for-tools-to-secure-enterprise-saas-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application security</a> and specific sectors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/actzero-emerges-from-stealth-with-40m-for-a-suite-of-cybersecurity-solutions-aimed-at-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMBs</a>, all of which complement the platform that Vectra has built, so you could imagine a number of interesting targets.)</p>
<p>The funding is being led by funds managed by Blackstone Growth, with unnamed existing investors participating (past backers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/vectra-raises-36m-for-its-ai-based-approach-to-cybersecurity-intrusion-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accel, Khosla</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/vectra-lands-100m-series-e-investment-for-ai-driven-network-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TCV</a>, among other financial and strategic investors). Vectra today largely <a href="https://www.vectra.ai/resource-type/case-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focuses on enterprises</a>, highly demanding ones with lots at stake to lose. Blackstone was initially a customer of Vectra&#8217;s, using the company&#8217;s flagship Cognito platform, Viral Patel &#8212; the senior MD who led the investment for the firm &#8212; pointed out to me.</p>
<p>The company has built some specific products that have been very prescient in anticipating vulnerabilities in specific applications and services. While it said that sales of its Cognito platform grew 100% last year, C<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ognito Detect for Microsoft Office 365 (a separate product) sales grew over 700%. Coincidentally, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud apps have faced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wave of malicious threats</a>. Sheth said that implementing Cognito (or indeed other network security protection) &#8220;could have prevented the SolarWinds hack&#8221; for those using it.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Through our experience as a client of Vectra, we’ve been highly impressed by their world-class technology and exceptional team,&#8221;  John Stecher, CTO at Blackstone, said in a statement. &#8220;They have exactly the types of tools that technology leaders need to separate the signal from the noise in defending their organizations from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. We’re excited to back Vectra and Hitesh as a strategic partner in the years ahead supporting their continued growth.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Sheth said that endpoint security will not be a focus for the moment because &#8220;in cloud there is so much open territory&#8221;. Instead it partners with the likes of CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black and others.</p>
<p>In terms of what is emerging as a stronger entry point, social media is increasingly coming to the fore, he said. &#8220;Social media tends to be an effective vector to get in and will remain to be for some time,&#8221; he said, with people impersonating others and suggesting conversations over encrypted services like WhatsApp. &#8220;The moment you move to encryption and exchange any documents, it&#8217;s game over.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://Gr4vy.com/">Gr4vy</a>, (pronounced ‘gravy’) is a cloud-native payments company with a “payment orchestration platform (POP)” that merges a Cloud platform with payments infrastructure. It’s also announcing a Series A funding round of $11.1M, led by Nyca Partners (a VC with a bench of partners who are ex-Visa ), with participation from Activant Capital (a fintech investor), Global Founders Capital, and Firestartr bringing its total funding to $12.2M.</p>
<p>So what is Gr4vy tackling here?</p>
<p>Over a video call, John Lunn, founder and CEO of Gr4vy outlined how it works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He told me that having worked in the payments space since the mid 1990s (Lunn is a veteran of PayPal) he saw the same problem over and over again: every retailer in the world is building the same piece of software.</p>
<p>He said retailers often start with one payment processor, grow and expand, but basically end up building what is now known as an &#8216;orchestration&#8217; platform. Essentially it&#8217;s like an internal router to route your payments wherever they need to go in the world. But the problem is that it all gradually becomes much and more complex to maintain.</p>
<p>He said: “I looked at the problem. I realized we need to create a piece of software that the retailer can run that will mean that payments get out of the way and it can all can be managed and orchestrated the way the retailer wants to do it&#8230; I thought there are two ways to do this: you can either get an endpoint SAAS to connect to this. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt like that&#8217;s actually not the solution here. We needed to give you something that allows you to do it yourself and fits into your infrastructure. So what we built with Gravy is essentially a cloud, where we spin you up an instance of Gravy on the cloud, wherever, whatever cloud you need it to be on, whether it’s, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or even in your own data center. That essentially gives you a platform to manage and control how your payments flow, both on the front end and the back end.”</p>
<p>Thus Gr4vy is quite a new idea: it combines Cloud and payment orchestration together on the one platform.</p>
<p>Gr4vy wil compete to some extent with <a href="http://Spreedly.com">Spreedly</a> and <a href="https://modopayments.com/">modo</a>. However, Gr4vy claims to be the only payments provider that will spin up a cloud instance for a customer.</p>
<p>It says, this gives a lot of flexibility for managing a payments stack as a company scales and removes a lot of the risks caused by a single point of failure or shared infrastructure. It also means it can be deployed across geographies, putting ‘Edges’ closer to customers. This, says Gr4vy, means fewer abandoned shopping carts, lost payments, and stronger compliance with local regulations. The platform also offers centralized reporting, monitoring, and management.</p>
<p>Lunn added: “We are the only payment orchestration platform built natively in the cloud&#8230; Retailers can expand and control their payment stack from anywhere. Gr4vy is also payment service provider agnostic. Retailers can mix and match providers, payment methods and route their transactions without being locked into a single ecosystem.”</p>
<p>So, Gr4vy, acts as a conduit between retailers’ shopping carts and payment providers. By offering instances &#8211; says the startup &#8211; it can give retailers individualized infrastructure in the cloud.</p>
<p>The launch of Gr4vy comes at a key time for online retailers as the world moves from part online shopping to almost 100% due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>GR4vy says its benefits include flexibility, customized workflows, a PCI1 Certified Gr4vy vault, a universal API, an easy modern checkout, no-code admin and centralized Transaction Reports.</p>
<p>Hans Morris, managing partner of Nyca Partners said in a statement: “Very few people in the world have as much experience and insight in international payments as John and his team. And their vision of what is needed for merchants is spot-on: a cloud-native tool to let businesses orchestrate and optimize their payments using their intuitive interfaces (no engineering!), robust security, and simple, seamless implementation. Much easier than managing today’s menu of complex, multiple payment platforms.”</p>
<p>“As investors focused on the future of commerce infrastructure, we’re eager to continue working with John and the Gr4vy team as they simplify payments orchestration for merchants and marketplaces of all sizes,” added Steve Sarracino, founder and partner at Activant Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced the launch of <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/readiness-for-reentry/">Grow with Google Career Readiness for Reentry</a>. The initiative &#8212; created in partnership with nonprofits The Last Mile, Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), Defy Ventures, Fortune Society and The Ladies of Hope Ministries &#8212; is designed to offer job readiness and digital skill training for formerly incarcerated individuals.</p>
<p>As the company notes in a blog post today, returning citizens have an <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/outofwork.html">unemployment rate 5x higher</a> than the national average &#8212; and returning citizens who are Black experience this at an even higher rate, due to discriminatory practices. In all, some 600,000 Americans attempt to make the transition from incarceration to employment every year.</p>
<p>Beginning this year, the initiative is set to train 10,000 people with a combination project-based and video learning curriculum. The learnings revolve around five points, per Google,</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Getting Started with the Basics</li>
<li>Job Search</li>
<li>Job <span class="il">Readiness</span>,</li>
<li>Online Safety</li>
<li>“Next Step” Job <span class="il">Readiness</span> Skills</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>“Lack of access to digital skills training and job coaching puts formerly incarcerated individuals at a severe disadvantage when trying to reenter the workforce and increase their economic potential,” said YouTube’s Global Head of Human Rights Malika Saada Saar in a statement tied to the news. “We are thrilled to work alongside program partners who have demonstrated true expertise and leadership in supporting successful reentry through digital skills training to men and women, mothers and fathers, impacted by incarceration.”</p>
<p>The company notes that the program is part of a broader initiative that has found it investing $40 million in criminal justice reform nonprofits, as well as $60 million for computer science learning.</p>

<p>No? I guess that’s just me then.</p>
<p>As a child, I always asked a lot of “how many/much” questions. Some were legitimate (&#8220;How much is 1 USD in VND?&#8221;); some were absurd (&#8220;How tall is the sky and can it be measured in chairs?&#8221;). So far, I’ve managed to maintain my obnoxious statistical probing habit without making any mortal enemies in my 20s. As it turns out, that habit comes with its perks when working in product.</p>

			Growing up, did you ever wonder how many chairs you’d have to stack to reach the sky?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My first job as a product designer was at a small but energetic fintech startup whose engineers also dabbled in pulling data. I constantly bothered them with questions like, “How many exports did we have from that last feature launched?” and “How many admins created at least one rule on this page?” I was curious about quantitative analysis but did not know where to start.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t the only one. Even then, there was a growing need for basic data literacy in the tech industry, and it’s only getting more taxing by the year. Words like “data-driven,” “data-informed” and “data-powered” increasingly litter every tech organization’s product briefs. But where does this data come from? Who has access to it? How might I start digging into it myself? How might I leverage this data in my day-to-day design once I get my hands on it?</p>
<h2>Data discovery for all: What’s in the way?</h2>
<p>“Curiosity is our compass” is one of Kickstarter’s guiding principles. Powered by a desire for knowledge and information, curiosity is the enemy of many larger, older and more structured organizations — whether they admit it or not — because it hinders the production flow. Curiosity makes you pause and take time to explore and validate the “ask.” Asking as many what’s, how’s, why’s, who’s and how many’s as possible is important to help you learn if the work is worth your time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the key ingredients in effective product development is receiving timely and relevant notifications about customer use, engagement, potential issues and more. Engineers, developers and product managers rely on that flow of information, but it&#8217;s typically delivered either via legacy email tools, or through notification systems built into product management dashboards that devs have to hand-code themselves. <a href="https://magicbell.com">MagicBell</a>, a startup that just went through Y Combinator&#8217;s most recent Winter cohort, has raised a $1.9 million seed round to deliver a rich notification platform for product teams that&#8217;s easy to integrate and use.</p>
<p>The round was led by Cherry Ventures, and includes participation by a number of angel investors including Algolia co-founder Nicolas Dessaigne, Twitter Director of Product Management Marie Outtier, and Wunderlist and Pitch co-founder Christian Reber. This list itself is a great endorsement of the need for what MagicBell&#8217;s building, since it&#8217;s a storied collection of veteran experts who have ample experience actually building some of the world&#8217;s most engaging software products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sofia [Bendz], Partner at Cherry Ventures], of course, worked at Spotify,&#8221; explained MagicBell CEO and co-founder Hana Mohan in an interview. &#8220;She has built a consumer product, and she has invested in a lot of startups [&#8230;] we followed YC&#8217;s advice in this batch, which was to definitely leave some room in the round for strategic angels.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2145573" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145573" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2145573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?w=506" alt="MagicBell's Notification inbox" width="506" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png 1088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=768,1032 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=506,680 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145573" class="wp-caption-text">An example of MagicBell&#8217;s Notification inbox.</p></div></p>
<p>That deep product experience on the cap table should serve MagicBell well as it seeks to grow the team, which currently consists of Mohan and co-founder Josue Montano. She and Montano previously worked on customer support ticketing system startup SupportBee, but found they were spending a lot of their time and effort on just building a notifications system for the platform. The greater opportunity, they realized, was in making that process plug-and-play, and scalable, since it&#8217;s something that can be intensely cost- and effort-intensive in setting up a new product, even though it&#8217;s also not anyone&#8217;s primary focus when building their software.</p>
<p>Basically everyone today is familiar and comfortable with a robust notification system — we use them constantly on our Android and iOS devices. Bu product teams use them, too, and the experience of doing so can add quite a bit of complexity and anxiety if they&#8217;re not handled well. MagicBell offers a notification inbox that&#8217;s embeddable into existing software via React, Javascript and REST (with additional frameworks in the pipeline), which provides real-time notification delivery, syncing of delivery and read status, individual user preference settings, and delivery across web, email and mobile clients.</p>
<p>Long term, the plan is to build MagicBell into a full-featured notification platform that offers a highly-customizable means of keeping your product team informed and in sync. Accordingly, the startup&#8217;s first priority with this initial funding is to hire engineers to help it build, says Mohan, and it&#8217;s also being driven by the product roadmaps of some of its initial customers — which coincidentally, includes a number of its investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the cool things for us was definitely that three or four of our customers ended up investing,&#8221; Mohan said, noting that <a href="https://pitch.com">Reber&#8217;s startup Pitch</a> was actually a customer before he decided to invest. &#8220;The other great thing about [Pitch] is that they have a pretty extensive roadmap themselves of launching a mobile offering, both on iOS and Android. So they&#8217;re really pushing the product forward, which is great for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohan is also one of the inaugural guests on our <a href="http://pod.link/found">new podcast Found</a>, and you can <a href="http://apple.co/found">subscribe now</a> to get our episode with her when it becomes available on Friday. She goes into a lot more detail about YC, and the process of identifying the need for MagicBell in the market, plus plenty more, so be sure to tune in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year of pandemic living has been real-world, and sometimes harrowing, proof of how important it can be to have efficient and well-equipped emergency response services in place. They can help people remotely if need be, and when they cannot, they make sure that in-person help can be dispatched quickly in medical and other situations. Today, a company that&#8217;s building cloud-based tools to help with this process is announcing a round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapiddeploy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RapidDeploy</a>, which provides computer-aided dispatch technology as a cloud-based service for 911 centers, has closed a round of $29 million, a Series B round of funding that will be used both to grow its business, and to continue expanding the SaaS tools that it provides to its customers. In the startup&#8217;s point of view, the cloud is essential to running emergency response in the most efficient manner.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;911 response would have been called out on a walkie talkie in the early days,&#8221; said Steve Raucher, the co-founder and CEO of RapidDeploy, in an interview. &#8220;Now the cloud has become the nexus of signals.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Washington, DC-based RapidDeploy provides data and analytics to 911 centers &#8212; the critical link between people calling for help and connecting those calls with the nearest medical, police or fire assistance &#8212; and today it has about 700 customers using its RadiusPlus, Eclipse Analytics and Nimbus CAD products.</p>
<p>That works out to about 10% of all 911 centers in the US (7,000 in total), and covering 35% of the population (there are more centers in cities and other dense areas). Its footprint includes state coverage in Arizona, California, and Kansas. It also has operations in South Africa, where it was originally founded.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from an interesting mix of financial and strategic investors. Led by Morpheus Ventures, the round also had participation from GreatPoint Ventures, Ericsson Ventures, Samsung Next Ventures, Tao Capital Partners, Tau Ventures, among others. It looks like the company had raised about $30 million before this latest round, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265357-09/company/profile#board-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. Valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Ericsson and Samsung, as major players in the communication industry, have a big stake in seeing through what will be the next generation of communications technology and how it is used for critical services. (And indeed, one of the big leaders in legacy and current 911 communications is Motorola, a would-be competitor of both.) AT&amp;T is also a strategic go-to-market (distribution and sales) partner of RapidDeploy&#8217;s, and it also has integrations with Apple, Google, Microsoft, and OnStar to feed data into its system.</p>
<p>The business of emergency response technology is a fragmented market. Raucher describes them as &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; businesses, with some 80% of them occupying four seats or less (a testament to the fact that a lot of the US is actually significantly less urban than its outsized cities might have you think it is), and in many cases a lot of these are operating on legacy equipment.</p>
<p>However, in the US in the last several years &#8212; buffered by innovations like the Jedi project and <a href="https://firstnet.gov/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FirstNet</a>, a next-generation public safety network &#8212; things have been shifting. RapidDeploy&#8217;s technology sits alongside (and in some areas competes with) companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbyne</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RapidSOS</a>, which have been tapping into the innovations of cell phone technology both to help pinpoint people and improve how to help them.</p>
<p>RapidDeploy&#8217;s tech is based around its RadiusPlus mapping platform, which uses d<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ata from smart phones, vehicles, home security systems and other connected devices and channels it to its data stream, which can help a center determine not just location but potentially other aspects of the condition of the caller. Its Eclipse Analytics services, meanwhile, are meant to act as a kind of assistant to those centers to help triage situations and provide insights into how to respond. The Nimbus CAD then helps figure out who to call out and routing for response. </span></p>
<p>Longer term, the plan will be to leverage cloud architecture to bring in new data sources and ways of communicating between callers, centers and emergency care providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about being more of a triage service rather than a message switch,&#8221; Raucher said. &#8220;As we see it, the platform will evolve with customers&#8217; needs. Tactical mapping ultimately is not big enough to cover this. We&#8217;re thinking about unified communications.&#8221; Indeed, that is the direction that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/technology/you-dont-need-flying-cars-to-save-lives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many of these services seem to be going</a>, which can only be a good thing for us consumers.</p>
<p>“The future of emergency services is in data, which creates a faster, more responsive 9-1-1 center,” said Mark Dyne, Founding Partner at Morpheus Ventures, in a statement. “We believe that the platform RapidDeploy has built provides the necessary breadth of capabilities that make the dream of Next-Gen 9-1-1 service a reality for rural and metropolitan communities across the nation and are excited to be investing in this future with Steve and his team.” Dyne has joined the RapidDeploy board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Returnal</em>, released today for the PlayStation 5, is an action adventure that has you exploring an alien world that reconfigures itself whenever you die, bringing you back for another shot at escaping. It&#8217;s exciting, frustrating, and beautiful, though it isn&#8217;t particularly original. But while it is arguably the first game to be released that was designed and built for next generation consoles, it&#8217;s not the mainstream hit many gamers are waiting for.</p>
<p>First I should probably justify my &#8220;arguably.&#8221; The PS5 debuted with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/demons-souls-the-first-truly-next-gen-game-is-a-lopsided-but-impressive-showcase/">the impressive remake of <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em>,</a> and while I enjoyed that greatly, it was only next-gen in its presentation; many dated aspects faithfully carried over from the original mean it can&#8217;t really be considered a fully next generation title. The pack-in <em>Astro&#8217;s Playroom</em> is a delight but doesn&#8217;t compare with full-scale games. <em>Destruction All-Stars</em> was something of a damp squib. And excellent games like <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> and <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Valhalla</em> span the generations, playing best but by no means exclusively on PS5.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Demon&#8217;s Souls: The first truly next-gen game is a lopsided but impressive showcase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/demons-souls-the-first-truly-next-gen-game-is-a-lopsided-but-impressive-showcase/embed/#?secret=n7pOq0JUhO" data-secret="n7pOq0JUhO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So <em>Returnal</em> really is, in a non-trivial way, the first <em>really</em> &#8220;next-gen&#8221; PS5 game — and it carries the &#8220;next-gen&#8221; PS5 price tag of $70, more in many regions. Can it justify this premium? In some ways yes, but like <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> this is a difficult game that involves a potentially off-putting amount of repetition and failure for mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>The game starts with your character, a sci-fi space explorer working for a mysterious company called Astra (there are clear nods to Weyland-Yutani from <em>Alien</em>), crashing on a forbidden planet and finding herself — literally — stuck in a sort of time loop. (You&#8217;ll see what I mean by literally.)</p>

<p>Without getting into the specifics of the plot, which is slowly revealed through found recordings, exploration of ancient ruins, and decoding alien symbols, Selene is seemingly trapped on the planet until she can figure out what&#8217;s going on, and whenever she dies the world shifts around to provide new challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>Each loop or &#8220;cycle&#8221; involves the player starting from the crash site and progressing through the world, different but familiar every time. You encounter enemies, collect power-ups like new weapons or artifacts that affect your abilities, and occasionally an item that will permanently augment your suit or open new paths to take.</p>
<p>To call any individual aspect of the game original would be inaccurate — it takes with a free hand from its august predecessors in both gameplay and presentation. Without spoiling too much I&#8217;d say its progression and design share the most with indie breakout hit <em>Dead Cells</em>, with a dose of <em>Risk of Rain 2,</em> and a setting <del>lifted wholesale from</del> elaborating on <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>. That said, the story and backstory owe more to <em>Solaris</em>. It wears its influences on its sleeve to be sure, but they come together as something cohesive, not a sloppy pastiche.</p>
<h2>Run, gun, rinse, repeat</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2144034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Returnal</em> starts out almost frustratingly simple, but this is soon remedied as new abilities and layers of complexity are added to the mix; expect the &#8220;tutorial&#8221; to be meted out over a few hours as things are discovered organically.</p>
<p>You make your way through what amounts to arena after arena, sometimes large and multi-layered, sometimes confined, and fight whatever appears. Combat is frantic and high risk — monsters don&#8217;t telegraph ponderous swipes at you but rather spew dozens or hundreds of bullets in your direction, making you rely on smart anticipatory movement and the cluttered landscape to stay alive. As you defeat them you accrue increasingly powerful boons that only last until you get hit, at which point they all disappear, adding a layer of urgency to every encounter: you could gain a crucial edge for the next miniboss — or lose what you&#8217;ve built up over minutes of careful play. You can&#8217;t take any enemy lightly — those that don&#8217;t kill you will make you weaker.</p>
<p>The player moves forward by exploring and eventually defeating an area boss, encounters that are more than a little taxing and generally take a few tries. Then it&#8217;s on to a new, different &#8220;biome&#8221; to do it all again with a different color scheme (and new enemies, hazards and so on).</p>
<p>The look and feel of <em>Returnal</em> is what you might call &#8220;early next-gen.&#8221; It&#8217;s detailed, interesting looking and realistic in a sci-fi way, and it uses lighting and color well to create both a sense of place and gameplay objectives. It&#8217;s better in some ways than what you&#8217;d expect from a PS4 or Xbox One game but ultimately the advances here seem to be more on the side of &#8220;fewer limitations&#8221; rather than &#8220;new capabilities.&#8221; Load times are practically non-existent — a second or two at most — and in places where sightlines are farther than a room or two, the scale of what&#8217;s being drawn is impressive. The framerate is a steady 60, making combat fluid no matter how crowded and chaotic it gets.</p>
<p>As for the claim of a &#8220;living world&#8221; that&#8217;s truly different every time, you can pretty much ignore that. You&#8217;ll encounter the same rooms and structures repeatedly, maybe with different enemies or items, but don&#8217;t expect a wildly different experience every loop. Just enough that the repetition isn&#8217;t too repetitious.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144037" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony/Housemarque</p></div></p>
<p>Sound is solid and I&#8217;d definitely recommend headphones. Your number one issue is going to be getting blasted in the back and positional audio will help a lot with that, as each enemy has characteristic noises for its actions.</p>
<p>The PS5 controller&#8217;s advanced haptics are put to good use with two-stage virtual triggers and a lot of contextual vibrations. I do wish there was a way to control these with a bit more granularity, as the constant patter of rain in the first area was numbing my hands, but the other haptic cues were useful and quickly became second nature.</p>
<p>Games in the &#8220;roguelite&#8221; (i.e. you start from scratch every life like a roguelike, but occasionally gain permanent upgrades) genre can fall flat if your progression, either within a loop or over many of them, involves little more than &#8220;+4% pistol damage&#8221; or a few more hit points. Fortunately <em>Returnal</em> is well aware of this and its weapons, artifacts, perks and so on often confer interesting bonuses or risk/reward mechanics. And you only have one weapon at a time, meaning the choice between, say, an assault rifle with special ability A and a shotgun with special ability B is a complex and risky one.</p>
<p>Eventually you&#8217;ll be able to skip past certain areas, but you may not want to, preferring to scour side paths for resources so you&#8217;re not going into the next boss room naked and afraid. In general the game manages to keep a lot of interesting tensions going on with the player that make every decision consequential, not to say agonizing.</p>
<h2>Next-gen price tag</h2>
<p>Is <em>Returnal</em> worth its premium $70 asking price? For some people, yes. But this isn&#8217;t the kind of mainstream blockbuster that would ordinarily justify the increased cost.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve played about 20 hours, done 30-odd runs, and based on what I know I&#8217;m about halfway through the game. Most of my progress was made on what I think of &#8220;prestige&#8221; runs, the handful where everything goes right and I get much further than before, making them tense and exciting. (Many ended within five minutes due to poor momentum or rage quits.) The game promises replay value past the credits, though, so a guess of 40 hours of content is more of a floor than a ceiling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144033" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144033" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144033" class="wp-caption-text">One of several trips to your house, inexplicably replicated on the alien planet&#8230;</p></div></p>
<p>The difficulty may present a barrier to many players. A dialogue at the start of the game warns you that the game is meant to be challenging and that death is part of the journey. Great, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less frustrating when you get ambushed by a dozen enemies, wiping out half an hour of of progress in an instant. While generally the game falls into the &#8220;tough but fair&#8221; category, there are spikes here and there that feel gratuitous, and loops where you feel unlucky or underpowered and have to fight the urge to reset.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind personally — compared to the <em>Dark Souls</em> series it&#8217;s a cakewalk. I almost beat the first boss on my first encounter; good luck doing that with Ornstein and Smough or Father Gascoigne! But like those games it takes a certain type of player to <em>want to</em> power through the early hours and access the huge amount of value essentially locked behind repeated failure. Similar to how many <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> players never progress past that game&#8217;s punishing first area, players not ready for the acrobatics and perseverance necessary to traverse the unforgiving bullet hell of <em>Returnal</em> may never escape its gloomy, restrictive first biome for the bright, open second one or glimpse its intriguing backstory. (I&#8217;ve included some tips below to help people get through the first hours.)</p>
<p>Compared with the steady progression and traditional storytelling of something like <em>AC: Valhalla</em> or <em>Miles Morales</em> this may put off less masochistic gamers or prompt more than a few controller-throwing, refund-requesting moments. After all, paying $70 for a game that slaps you in the face while you try to access the latter $50 worth of it can be justifiably frustrating.</p>
<p>With all that said, it is nice to see a AAA next-generation game that isn&#8217;t a sequel or franchise, and seeing the &#8220;roguelite&#8221; formula embraced seriously beyond the indie world. <em>Returnal</em> may not be for everyone, but for the subset of gamers who have embraced this genre for years, it&#8217;s an easy one to recommend.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tips for playing:</strong></p>
<p>If you do decide to dive in, here are a handful of non-spoilery &#8220;wish I&#8217;d known that&#8221; tips to get you on the right track.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of hidden rooms and items, so check your mini-map frequently for things you&#8217;ve missed in the chaos and peek in every nook and cranny.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re undamaged, healing pickups contribute towards adding crucial max health — one more reason to not get hit.</li>
<li>New abilities create new opportunities in old areas — there&#8217;s a reason so much of the first biome is inaccessible at first.</li>
<li>You can get to those treasures behind bars. Look around carefully (and shoot everything).</li>
<li>&#8220;Malignant&#8221; treasure is usually more trouble than it&#8217;s worth and the debuffs can sink a run. Only do if desperate or you have a cure handy. (Parasites on the other hand can be very useful.)</li>
<li>There&#8217;s always a healing item for sale at the biome&#8217;s &#8220;shop,&#8221; so there&#8217;s no excuse for going into a boss room without one. (And self-healing artifacts will save your life five times over.)</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Zynga bought hyper-casual game maker Rollic</a>. Today, <a href="https://rollicgames.com">Rollic</a> is a Zynga subsidiary, and it&#8217;s announcing the acquisition of another game studio called <a href="https://www.uncosoft.com">Uncosoft</a>.</p>
<p>Like Rollic, Uncosoft develops hyper-casual games and is based in Turkey (Istanbul in Rollic&#8217;s case, Izmir in Uncosoft&#8217;s). In fact, Rollic has already published a couple of Uncosoft games, most notably High Heels, in which the player navigates an obstacle course in increasingly ridiculous high heels — the company said High Heels (or, if you insist, High Heels!) has been downloaded more than 60 million times since it launched in January, and it&#8217;s even been praised for bringing <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/high-heels-app-game-queer-joy">&#8220;queer joy to the top of the App Store charts.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Rollic co-founder and CEO Burak Vardal told me that when you&#8217;re in the hyper-casual gaming business, you&#8217;re &#8220;always looking for product-oriented teams.&#8221; And it sounds like Vardal is impressed by what he&#8217;s seen of the Uncosoft team, making him confident that it can successfully build &#8220;new titles like High Heels.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Producing a game together as development studio and publisher, you already start working like a merged company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You argue about game design all day, you share strategies [&#8230;] and you — not on purpose — start learning about how that company operates, how are the founders, how is the art team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Uncosoft CEO Edip Enes Çakır said in a statement that there has been &#8220;unprecedented harmony&#8221; between the two teams as they&#8217;ve worked together in recent years, and that &#8220;our culture and vision of making global games will be augmented with the expertise of Rollic and Zynga.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rollic was actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Zynga&#8217;s fourth acquisition in Istanbul</a>, so it&#8217;s clear that the city and country are becoming a bit of a hub. Vardal said Rollic does have partners outside of Turkey, but he suggested that the country has been particularly successful with hyper-casual games because of <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/education/2018/09/18/number-of-students-in-turkey-surpasses-population-of-143-countries">its huge student population</a>.</p>
<p>Vardal also suggested that High Heels points to a path that other hyper-casual games might follow to success: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/8/22272980/high-heels-tiktok-ios-app-store-free-game">namely, TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The animations of the game and the character mechanic are what we call TikTok-able,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It had a huge impact in Gen Z and huge organic reach in TikTok [&#8230;] The new generation wants content that feeds that ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, adding 60 more to the constellation on orbit. This is the 24th Starlink launch in total, and means SpaceX has now sent up over 1,500 Starlink spacecraft, with around 1,438 of those still in operation. This is the first Starlink launch since April 7 — which, surprisingly, is the biggest gap between these launches in quite a while.</p>
<p>This year, SpaceX&#8217;s overall launch calendar has been dominated by Starlink launches, as the company seeks to expand the availability, quality and coverage of its low Earth orbit broadband internet network. SpaceX also opened up availability of Starlink service this year, and now seems to be mostly supply-constrained on the consumer receiver terminal side, rather than necessarily on network capacity or regional ability.</p>
<p>Regarding that few week gap in the Starlink launch pace, it&#8217;s not like SpaceX was slacking in the meantime; the launcher sent up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/spacex-successfully-launches-astronauts-with-a-re-used-dragon-spacecraft-for-the-first-time/">second crew of astronauts destined for the International Space Station in a flight just last week</a>. Plus, it has two three additional Starlink launches tentatively scheduled to happen in May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This latest launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 11:44 PM EDT (8:44 PM PDT) on Wednesday, and it used a flight-proven Falcon 9 first stage booster, which was used on six prior missions, including four Starlink launches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a> has raised a new $73 million Series B funding round (€60 million) led by Greenoaks with existing investor Ribbit Capital also participating. Following today’s funding round, Vivid Money has reached a valuation of $436 million (€360 million).</p>
<p>Vivid Money could be considered as a Revolut competitor designed specifically for the Eurozone. Built on top of <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a> for the banking infrastructure, the company lets you send, receive, spend, invest and save money in different ways.</p>
<p>When you create an account, you get a German IBAN that starts with DE as well as a metal card. There are no card details on the card itself —&nbsp;everything is available in the app instead. Like other fintech startups, Vivid Money lets you control your card from the app —&nbsp;you can lock it and unlock it, add it to Google Pay and Apple Pay, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can top up your account and hold dozens of different currencies. When you pay with your card abroad, the startup applies a small mark-up on the current exchange rate — you should get a better exchange rate than what you usually get with a regular bank.</p>
<p>In addition to this fairly standard feature set, Vivid Money offers stock trading with fractional shares. You can invest in stocks and ETFs and there’s no commission. Similarly, you can buy, hold and share cryptocurrencies from the app. The startup has partnered with CM Equity AG for those features.</p>
<p>The company also has a <a href="https://vivid.money/en-de/cashback/">cashback program</a> and a premium subscription for €9.90 per month. Paid users get higher limits on free cash withdrawals, the ability to create a virtual card, support for additional currencies and better cashback rewards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can create sub-accounts called pockets. You can move money around from one pocket to another and add other users to your pockets. Each pocket has its own IBAN, which means that you can pay for certain bills with a separate pocket. You can also associate your card with a specific pocket for upcoming purchases.</p>
<p>Vivid Money has managed to add a ton of features in no time. It now has a ton of money on its bank account. Now let’s see if it can attract a significant user base to compete with other, well-established European fintech players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform TravelPerk is announcing a $160M Series D. The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/">pandemic</a> has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform <a href="https://www.travelperk.com">TravelPerk</a> is announcing a $160M Series D.</p>
<p>The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity firm Greyhound Capital. Existing investors also participated (specifically: DST, Kinnevik, Target Global, Felix Capital, Spark Capital, Heartcore, LocalGlobe and Amplo).</p>
<p>No valuation is being disclosed, nor is the split between equity and debt. So it&#8217;s a bit more of a convoluted &#8216;vote of confidence&#8217; vs TravelPerk&#8217;s pre-pandemic raises &#8212; as you&#8217;d expect given the locked down year we&#8217;ve all had.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series D means the 2015-founded Barcelona-based startup has pulled in a total of $294M to-date for its user-friendly retooling of business trip booking geared toward &#8216;global SMEs&#8217;, following a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/"> top-up of $60M </a>(in 2019) to its 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/travelperk-grabs-44m-to-take-its-pain-free-saas-for-business-travel-global/">$44M Series C</a> &#8212; which itself fast-followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/travelperk-grabs-21m-to-make-booking-business-trips-suck-less/">$21M Series B that same year</a>.</p>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s approach is akin to a consumerization play for the (non-enterprise end of) business trip booking, combining what it bills as &#8220;the world’s largest bookable travel inventory&#8221; &#8212; letting users compare, book and invoice trains, cars, flights, hotels and apartments from a range of providers including Kayak, Skyscanner, Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb &#8212; with tools for businesses to manage and report trips.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the obligatory freemium tier for the smallest teams. It also offers 24/7 traveler support, a flexible booking option and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/travelperk-launches-an-open-api-platform-to-extend-its-work-trip-saas/">open API</a> for custom integrations.</p>
<p>There was no funding announcement for TravelPerk in 2020, as investors took a break from the pandemic-struck sector. But earlier this year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">told TechCrunch</a> it had been starting to see interest picking up again, as of fall 2020. The closing of a Series D now &#8212; albeit debt and equity &#8212; suggests VCs are getting over the worst of their travel wobbles.</p>
<p>(Another sign on that front is the $155M Series E raise for U.S.-based TripActions, which closed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/">January</a> on a $5BN valuation, as U.S. corporate travel lifted off from 2020&#8217;s lows.)</p>

<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s PR talks bullishly about momentum and using the funds to accelerate &#8216;global growth&#8217;, even as the coronavirus continues to hit parts of Europe and the U.S. &#8212; its two main markets &#8212; despite what are relatively advanced vaccination rollouts (especially the US) vs other parts of the world.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, COVID-19 is taking a particularly heavy toll on India, where the health system looks to be careening out of control in the face of a massive wave of infections. Parts of Latin America are also struggling. A third of the way through 2021 the pandemic looks far from done. And that makes for a still uncertain outlook for business travel over the coming months.</p>
<p>The typical pre-pandemic business trip is now a Zoom call, while former conference calls may have morphed into emails or group chatter in Slack. And there&#8217;s no immediate reason for that to change, given remote-working professionals have had a year to adjust to a richer mix of digital comms tools.</p>
<p>In 2021 it&#8217;s hard to imagine an overwhelming return for business travel &#8212; not least as plenty of offices remain shuttered. The contagion risk vs hard-to-quantify in-person networking rewards associated with non-essential business trips will surely see work trips remaining a hard sell for a lot of companies.</p>
<p>Still, TravelPerk and its investors are willing to bet that work trips will rebound &#8212; in time.</p>
<p>The plan is to be ready to meet what it expects will be a far more &#8216;moveable feast&#8217; of business travel demand in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel is definitely coming back,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir. &#8220;We can see that already with the numbers. In the US for instance, we can see a 70-75% recovery in domestic flights compared to the baseline before COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Europe it’s a little less certain right now, as vaccine rollout isn’t as fast, but you can look to other parts of the world and with some degree of certainty predict what the European recovery will eventually look like by looking at those examples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect the overall global recovery in travel to be uneven over the next year, with different countries reopening at different times, meaning constantly changing guidelines and restrictions,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue living in a stage of uncertainty probably for the next 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve realised from speaking to our customers that the demand for travel is there, people are eager to do these trips, but this period of uncertainty makes it difficult for them so we’re focused on finding solutions that can address that.&#8221;</p>
<p>TravelPerk didn&#8217;t sit on its hands last year as global business travel cratered. Instead, it focused on investing in product development, making bets on how it needs to tool up for the new climate of increased uncertainty &#8212; including by taking<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a number of steps toward making its business more resilient to the ravages of COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last October it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/travelperk-launches-an-api-for-covid-19-restrictions/">launched an API</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; saying it wanted to help the wider travel industry access up to date info on coronavirus restrictions. It also picked up a risk management startup, called Albatross, back in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.travelperk.com/press-release/travelperk-acquires-startup-albatross-to-boost-travel-risk-management-offering/">July</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, to feed its own resilience efforts.</span></p>
<p>Another more recent acquisition was geared toward scaling its business in the U.S. &#8212; where domestic travel looks to be recovering faster than Europe. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">January</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it announced it was buying YC-backed rival NexTravel &#8212; gaining a base in Chicago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the same time, it inked a partnership with Southwest Airlines to plug a key gap in its U.S. offering.</span></p>
<p>Meir avoids breaking out any revenue growth projections for the U.S. or Europe for this year or next, when we ask, which suggests he&#8217;s preparing for lean growth in the short term.</p>
<p>What he does say is that investors were impressed TravelPerk managed to grow its customer base 2x in 2020 (it now has 3,000+ businesses using its platform, including a bunch of familiar startup names) &#8212; and that it avoided making layoffs (when other travel businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/">swung the axe</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we doubled the size of our customer-base and we now have over 3,000 businesses using the platform, including the likes of Wise, Farfetch, GetYourGuide and Monzo. The travel budget under management also increased by almost 100% over the last 12 months,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we had such interest from investors with this round is because we had, given the context, a really good 2020. We doubled our customer base, avoided making layoffs, and most importantly we were there for our customers when they needed us, constantly investing in the product to enable safe travel during Covid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis TravelPerk is now working to is that &#8220;flexibility, safety and sustainability&#8221; will be more important than ever for business travellers, per Meir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flexibility, because travel still has a lot of friction due to the different restrictions and travel lockdowns mean that a trip could be cancelled at really short notice,&#8221; says Meir. &#8220;Safety, so that every traveler knows not only what specific health requirements are in place at their destination, but also that they will get updates in real time if anything changes. Sustainability, because in this period businesses have been taking stock and realising that we all have to do more in terms of our environmental impact &#8212; and of course travel is a big part of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked hard to respond quickly to these requirements,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We updated our product and product roadmap to better match these new needs. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/travelperk-launches-flexible-refunds-to-help-businesses-save-on-cancelled-trips/">flexible booking tool FlexiPerk</a> [which TravelPerk happened to launch pre-pandemic, in summer 2019] guarantees refunds on cancelled trips at short notice; our risk-management API TravelSafe keeps travellers updated in real time on local health guidelines and restrictions; and GreenPerk, our sustainability tool, directly reduces carbon emissions through initiatives run by our partner Atmosfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sustainability and business travel aren&#8217;t a natural pairing, however. Certainly not for air travel &#8212; where environmental groups accuse carbon offsetting schemes of boiling down to &#8216;greenwashing&#8217; when what&#8217;s really needed to achieve a reduction in CO2e emissions is for people to take fewer flights.</p>
<p>TravelPerk launched its GreenPerk offsetting scheme in February 2020, letting customers pay a fee per carbon tonne to cover its guesstimate of the total emissions toll their trip will generate. But it&#8217;s only been applied to 10% of its business volume so far.</p>
<p>With 90% <em>not</em> <em>even being offset</em>, you hardly need to be Greta Thunberg to call that the opposite of &#8216;sustainable&#8217;.</p>
<p>Still, Meir says he expects the offset percentage to &#8220;grow rapidly&#8221;. &#8220;We intend to use this funding to develop GreenPerk even further,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We want to be the standard bearer for the industry in terms of sustainable business travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>However when asked whether TravelPerk might seek to advance sustainability by supporting digital replacement itself (such as by being able to offer its users videoconferencing as an alternative to flying) he declines to comment, saying: &#8220;We don’t have anything to share yet on how we’ll advance that goal [sustainability] right now, but we’re working on some exciting ideas!&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming up with creative ways to reduce the need for business travel certainly doesn&#8217;t feature in TravelPerk&#8217;s near term vision.</p>
<p>Meir predicts a &#8220;full comeback&#8221; for business travel &#8212; arguing that &#8220;the meetings that matter happen in person&#8221; &#8212; while conceding that the travel industry will nonetheless be very different. (Hence its goal of &#8220;building the products for that [more flexible] future&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to double down on growth in the U.S. and Europe and that includes making key hires across all roles, especially in our hubs in Chicago, London, and Barcelona,&#8221; he says, adding that it expects the team to grow &#8220;rapidly&#8221; in the next 12-24 months (without putting any numbers on the planned hires).</p>
<p>TravelPerk will also continue to eye acquisition targets, per Meir. &#8220;Following our first two acquisitions, of Albatross and NexTravel, this funding round will also help us to continue being aggressive in our growth strategy. We aim to complete more acquisitions this year,&#8221; he says on that. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst many other providers have been in hibernation over the past year, we’ve been aggressive, continuing to update our product and growing our customer base, and we think that gives us a great foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series D in a statement, Pogos Saiadian, investor at Greyhound Capital, said: “There is no doubt that from 2021 onwards the average business trip will look very different to how it did in 2019. We are confident that business travel will recover and thrive in the years ahead. We also believe that people will, more than ever before, need a platform like TravelPerk that has deep inventory, excellent ‘seven-star’ customer service, provides a great traveler experience and integrates with the broader tech-stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this is a huge long-term opportunity, and as customers ourselves, we see first-hand the tremendous value that TravelPerk provides across organizations, from finance to admin and the travellers themselves. The fact the company is beating growth expectations already for this year further supports our belief that TravelPerk is a true market leader, and we are delighted to be supporting the next stage of the company’s growth with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament approved a new law on terrorist content takedowns yesterday, paving the way for one-hour removals to become the legal standard across the EU.</p>
<p>The regulation &#8220;addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online&#8221; will come into force shortly after publication in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal &#8212; and start applying 12 months after that.</p>
<p>The incoming regime means providers serving users in the region must act on terrorist content removal notices from Member State authorities within one hour of receipt, or else provide an explanation why they have been unable to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="ep_name">There are exceptions for educational, research, artistic and journalistic work &#8212; with lawmakers aiming to target terrorism propaganda being spread on online platforms like social media sites.</span></p>
<p>The types of content they want speedily removed under this regime includes material that incites, solicits or contributes to terrorist offences; provides instructions for such offences; or solicits people to participate in a terrorist group.</p>
<p>Material posted online that provides guidance on how to make and use explosives, firearms or other weapons for terrorist purposes is also in scope.</p>
<p><span class="ep_name">However concerns have been raised over the impact on online freedom of expression &#8212; including if platforms use content filters to shrink their risk, given the tight turnaround times required for removals. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">The law does not put a general obligation on platforms to monitor or filter content but it does push service providers to prevent the spread of proscribed content &#8212; saying they must take steps to prevent propagation. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">It is left up to service providers how exactly they do that, and while there&#8217;s </span><span class="ep_name">no legal obligation to use automated tools it seems likely filters will be what larger providers reach for, with the risk of unjustified, speech chilling takedowns fast-following. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">Another concern is how exactly terrorist content is being defined under the law &#8212; with <a href="https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/terrorist-content-regulation-open-letter-to-meps/43410">civil rights groups warning</a> that authoritarian governments within Europe might seek to use it to go after critics based elsewhere in the region.</span></p>
<p>The law does include transparency obligations &#8212; meaning providers must publicly report information about content identification and takedown actions annually.</p>
<p>On the sanctions side, Member States are responsible for adopting rules on penalties but the regulation sets a top level of fines for repeatedly failing to comply with provisions at up to 4% of global annual turnover.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers proposed the new rules<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/"> back in 2018 </a> when concern was riding high over the spread of ISIS content online.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech giants told to remove extremist content much faster&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tech-giants-told-to-remove-extremist-content-much-faster/embed/#?secret=dJdjM3eglA" data-secret="dJdjM3eglA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Platforms were pressed to abide by an informal one-hour takedown rule in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/social-media-handed-one-hour-rule-for-terrorist-takedowns-in-europe/">March</a> of the same year. But within months the Commission came with a more expansive <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-preventing-terrorist-content-online-regulation-640_en.pdf">proposal</a> for a regulation aimed at “preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online”.</p>
<p>Negotiations over the proposal have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/one-hour-terrorist-takedowns-backed-by-eu-parliaments-civil-liberties-committee/">MEPs</a> and Member States (via the Council) tweaking provisions &#8212; with the former, for example, pushing for a provision that requires competent authority to contact companies that have never received a removal order a little in advance of issuing the first order to remove content &#8212; to provide them with information on procedures and deadlines &#8212; so they&#8217;re not caught entirely on the hop.</p>
<p>The impact on smaller content providers has continued to be a concern for critics, though.</p>
<p>The Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/03/16/terrorist-content-online-council-adopts-new-rules/">adopted its final position</a> in March. The approval by the Parliament yesterday concludes the co-legislative process.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">Commenting in a statement, MEP Patryk JAKI, the rapporteur for the legislation, said: “Terrorists recruit, share propaganda and coordinate attacks on the internet. Today we have established effective mechanisms allowing member states to remove terrorist content within a maximum of one hour all around the European Union. I strongly believe that what we achieved is a good outcome, which balances security and freedom of speech and expression on the internet, protects legal content and access to information for every citizen in the EU, while fighting terrorism through cooperation and trust between states.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a> has raised a $300 million Series D funding round led by Oak HC/FT. With today’s funding the round, the company is now valued at $2.4 billion. The company has been building infrastructure and white-label services for enterprise clients that want to offer cryptocurrency products to their own customers.</p>
<p>In particular, Paxos has partnered with PayPal for its cryptocurrency features. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">October 2020</a>, PayPal customers have been able to buy, hold and sell a handful of crypto assets —&nbsp;Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Venmo, a PayPal subsidiary, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">added</a> the same cryptocurrency features just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include Declaration Partners, PayPal Ventures, Mithril Capital, Senator Investment Group, Liberty City Ventures and WestCap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos offers different products, such crypto trading and settlement, custody and the ability to issue tokens. It focuses on big enterprise clients, such as Revolut, Crédit Suisse, Société Générale and StoneX.</p>
<p>The company tries to be as compliant as possible. And it plans to remain committed to regulation across several geographies and verticals.</p>
<p>For instance, Paxos plans to launch the Paxos National Trust Bank and to apply for a Clearing Agency registration with the SEC in the U.S. In Singapore, the company is applying for a Major Payment Institution license. Paxos thinks that this regulation edge will foster partnerships with more enterprise clients looking for safe cryptocurrency opportunities.</p>
<p>Paxos has also launched its own stablecoin called Paxos Standard (PAX). Stablecoins are crypto assets like BTC or ETH. But the value of PAX is indexed on USD. At any point in time, one PAX is worth one USD. Other popular stablecoins include Tether and USDC.</p>
<p>The company also lets you issue your own branded stablecoin. For instance, Binance has worked with Paxos to issue BUSD on its platform. As expected, one BUSD is also worth one USD.</p>
<p>Paxos is also well known for PAX Gold, a digital asset that is backed by physical gold. It’s an alternative to gold ETFs that should be more efficient as it lives on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Finally, Paxos has its own cryptocurrency exchange called <a href="https://www.paxos.com/itbit/">itBit</a>. According to CoinMarketCap, itBit only <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/itbit/">features</a> a handful of trading trading pairs. It isn’t meant to be a consumer-facing exchange but it powers Paxos’ other products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.taster.com">Taster</a> has raised a $37 million Series B funding round from Octopus Venture, Battery Ventures, Latitude (LocalGlobe), HeartCore, Rakuten, GFC and Founders Future. The company operates dozens of restaurants that only exist on food delivery platforms. You can’t book a table as there is no table.</p>
<p>Taster has been focusing on five street food-inspired concepts so far —&nbsp;Bian Dang (Taiwanese food), A Burgers (plant-based burgers), Mission Saigon (Vietnamese food), Out Fry (Korean food) and Stacksando (Japanese street food). After that, Taster has opened dozens of kitchens across 40 different cities and listed its kitchens on food delivery platforms, such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats.</p>
<p>Essentially, the startup wants to build new restaurant chains for the 21st century. Instead of opening brick-and-mortar restaurants, Taster focuses on food delivery as it’s still a booming segment. In Paris, Taster restaurants are the third restaurant group on Deliveroo behind McDonald’s and Burger King —&nbsp;it represents over 5,000 meals per day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After operating its own kitchens, Taster now wants to partner with existing restaurants that don’t get a lot of orders on Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Taster brings its own native brands and menus as well as its tech tools.</p>
<p>Taster has built its own delivery app for Android and iOS. But you can still find Taster’s restaurants on third-party platforms. The startup doesn’t want to reinvent the wheel and replace food ordering platforms. But it makes sense to offer its service to end customers directly.</p>
<p>As Taster brands become more and more familiar, it should create demand from day one —&nbsp;restaurants can expect between €4,000 and €6,000 in revenue during the first week. By 2025, Taster wants to operate in 1,000 cities thanks to this partnership model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Institutions need to keep their crypto assets somewhere. And they aren’t going to keep it on some random, or consumer-grade crypto operation. This requires more sophisticated technology. Furthermore, being in the EU is going to be a key barrier to entry for many US or Asia-based operations.</p>
<p>Thus it is that Berlin-based digital asset custody and financial services platform<br />
<a href="https://www.finoa.io/">Finoa</a>, has closed a $22 million Series A funding round, to do just that.</p>
<p>The round was led by Balderton Capital, alongside existing investors Coparion, Venture Stars and Signature Ventures, as well as an undisclosed investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crucially, the Berlin-based startup works with Dapper Lab’s FLOW protocol, NEAR, and Mina, which are fast becoming standards for crypto assets. They are going up against large players such as Anchorage, Coinbase Custody, Bitgo, exchanges like Binance and Kraken, and self-custody solutions like Ledger.</p>
<p>Finoa says it now has over 250 customers, including T-Systems, DeFi-natives like CoinList and financial institutions like Bankhaus Scheich.</p>
<p>The company says its plan is to become a regulated platform for institutional investors and corporations to manage their digital assets and it has received a preliminary crypto custody license and is supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by Christopher May and Henrik Ebbing, but both had previously worked together at McKinsey and started working in blockchain in 2017.</p>
<p>May commented: “We are proud to have established Finoa as Europe’s leading gateway for institutional participation and incredibly excited to accelerate our growth even further. We look forward to supporting new exciting protocols and projects, empowering innovative corporate use cases, and adding additional (decentralized) financial products and services to our platform.”</p>
<p>Colin Hanna, Principal at Balderton Capital, who leads most of Balderton&#8217;s Crypto investments, said: “Chris, Henrik, and the entire Finoa team have built a deeply impressive business which bridges the highest levels of professionalism with radical innovation. As custodians of digital asset private keys, Finoa needs to be trusted both with the secure management of those keys and with the products and services that allow their clients to fully leverage the power of native digital assets. The team they have assembled is uniquely positioned to do just that.” </p>
<p>May added: “We identified a lack of sophisticated custody and asset servicing solutions for safeguarding and managing blockchain-based digital assets that successfully cover the needs of institutional investors. Finoa is bridging this gap by providing seamless, safe, and regulated access to the world of digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Being in the European Union requires a fundamentally different organizational setup, and poses a very high entry to new incumbents and other players overseas. There are few that have managed to do what Finoa has done in a European context and hence why we now see ourselves in a leading position.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s smartphone rivals in China are quickly divvying up the market share it has lost over the past year.</p>
<p>92.4 million units of smartphones were shipped in China during the first quarter, with Vivo claiming the crown with a 23% share and its sister company Oppo following closely behind with 22%, according to market research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/China-smartphone-market-Q1-2021?ctid=2041-5814e927aabab0e63f5070cbd38a12b6">Canalys</a>. Huawei, of which smartphone sales took a hit after U.S. sanctions cut key chip parts off its supply chain, came in third at 16%. Xiaomi and Apple took the fourth and fifth spot respectively.</p>
<p>All major smartphone brands but Huawei saw a jump in their market share in China from Q1 2020. Apple&#8217;s net sales in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year to $17.7 billion in the three months ended March, a quarter of all-time record revenue for the American giant, according to its latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">financial results</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family,&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422230-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Tim Cook during an earnings call this week. &#8220;You have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s share shrunk from a dominant 41% to 16% in a year&#8217;s time, though the telecom equipment giant managed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-huawei-reports-drop-q1-revenue-smartphone-income-hit-2021-04-28/">increase its profit margin</a> partly thanks to slashed costs. In November, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">sold off its budget phone line Honor</a>.</p>
<p>This quarter is also the first time China&#8217;s smartphone market has grown in four years, with a growth rate of 27%, according to Canalys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leading vendors are racing to the top of the market, and there was an unusually high number of smartphone launches this quarter compared with Q1 2020 or even Q4 2020,&#8221; said Canalys analyst Amber Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei’s sanctions and Honor’s divestiture have been hallmarks of this new market growth, as consumers and channels become more open to alternative brands.&#8221;</p>
