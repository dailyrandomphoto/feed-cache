					<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you're trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data privacy is top of mind for online sellers, and for good reason: Regulators in China, Europe and North America are taking an interest, and iOS 14.5 allowed many consumers to disable data tracking, with negative consequences for companies that relied on Facebook&#8217;s granular ad targeting.</p>
<p>Bearing those factors and others in mind, Ben Parr, president and co-founder of e-commerce marketing platform Octane.ai, shared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022/">his e-commerce predictions for 2022</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalization and zero-party data become critical.</li>
<li>E-commerce embraces web3 and NFTs, but what will that look like?</li>
<li>Live shopping goes mainstream.</li>
<li>Slow but gradual improvement to the supply chain.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>If you manage an e-commerce startup&#8217;s brand, this is a helpful overview; Parr even weighs in on whether startups need to begin putting NFTs on their virtual shelves this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m also eager to see brands utilize tokens for loyalty and rewards, a topic I’ve heard people discuss but not yet embrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>My prediction: We&#8217;ll be running many articles in 2022 with tactics for zero-party data collection. Google temporarily postponed its plan to deprecate third-party cookies until the latter half of 2023, which means the ad tech landscape is going to undergo tectonic shifts.</p>
<p>We have more expert-written posts with 2022 predictions in the pipeline, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading,</p>

<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea’s valuation has skyrocketed, but at $13.3 billion, its revenue multiple isn&#8217;t very high when compared with other software companies, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that the new OpenSea valuation is cheap compared to recent fundamentals, but a little expensive when we consider how much its market booms and busts.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you&#8217;re trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers&#8217; growing desire for more privacy, but here&#8217;s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey,&#8221; the research company reported.</p>
<p>Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ guest post, she covers the &#8220;downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars&#8221; and shares several strategies that are producing results — as well as some &#8220;crazy&#8221; ideas &#8220;that seemed ridiculous at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a startup with relatively good financial performance, consumer financial service startup Dave could have bided its time for an initial public offering. Instead, it chose the SPAC route.</p>
<p>While the decision brought benefits, the fact that a cohort of less-than-stellar SPAC listings debuted at the same time brought some troubles as well, said CEO and co-founder Jason Wilk.</p>
<p>“If I could have done it all over again, I guess it would have been the same price discovery and guaranteed capital without the name SPAC associated with it, just because it’s been unfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our latest guest column with predictions for the coming year doesn’t just prognosticate: Growth expert Jonathan Martinez shares several tactics early-stage companies can use to capitalize on these trends.</p>
<p>Among other topics, Martinez shared methods for incrementally testing ads, his ideas about video ads and influencer marketing, and a few thoughts about Facebook and iOS 14 privacy changes.</p>
<p>“I believe we’ll start seeing heavy investments by Facebook and other social media platforms to keep users on their platforms, where they will still have access to first-party data,” writes Martinez.</p>

<p>Digital advertising has changed a lot in the past year, and it’s bound to change further when Google blocks third-party cookies from Chrome next year.</p>
<p>For publishers, it means advertising dollars should be spent wisely on strategies that maximize ad monetization without relying on old methods, writes James Avery, founder and CEO of Kevel.</p>
<p>In a deep dive of the changing ad world, Avery explains how publishers will have to prioritize first-party data to gather user insights, the importance of walled garden ad solutions, and why unified IDs are unsustainable in the long term.</p>

<p>Israel&#8217;s cybersecurity startups raised a stunning $8.84 billion last year, more than triple the amount raised in 2020 ($2.75 billion), according to YL Ventures’ State of the Cyber Nation 2021 report.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity in Israel has become a polarized market that accepts only two types of startups: potential unicorns and actual unicorns,” writes Yonit Wiseman, associate at YL Ventures.</p>

<p>Public software stocks have lost a fair bit of value so far this year, but startup valuations continue to climb higher, seemingly unaffected by the markets’ declining opinion, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>“Startups had best hope that private investors are right to index heavily on nascent growth rates over other traditional private-market metrics.</p>
<p>If not, everyone is going to be left holding some part of the bag when later rounds don’t consummate at higher prices.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Much of Chinese society has come to depend on so-called super apps like WeChat to do multiple tasks, from making a medical appointment to hailing a taxi to getting a loan, all on one platform.</p>
<p>But such one-stop shops have not taken off in the United States. Now, the time may finally be ripe &#8212; and the best contenders for super apps come from the fintech world, especially those platforms dedicated to cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is quickly growing in popularity amid sky-high equity prices, record-low interest rates and fear of inflation on the horizon, and they could, perhaps, gain more legitimacy if the U.S. government decides to fully regulate them, a topic<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/business/house-financial-services-crypto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Congress is currently exploring</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dedicated crypto platforms like Coinbase or even Paypal, Venmo and Stripe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/payments-giant-stripe-says-its-re-entering-the-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which recently</a> added abilities to use crypto for payments, could evolve into the U.S. versions of super apps, assuming crypto issuers can work with regulators to find a middle ground between protecting the consumer and creating new financial and investment opportunities. If consumers see crypto as secure and legitimate — and easy to use — it could become the base of super apps.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Expanding these crypto and payment apps to integrate with other apps and services would make many diverse tasks more convenient. The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit, and such apps would help deliver the financial services they need in a personalized manner.</p>
<p>Integrating crypto payments into other tasks would also go a long way in democratizing the world of finance and money, giving underserved communities and those with no credit histories who struggle to open credit cards or get loans more access to financial services.</p>
<h2>The rise of the super app</h2>
<p>WeChat started out as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging app in China</a> in 2011, but by 2013 it also functioned as a <a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/china-digital-payments-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payment platform</a> and soon offered many other services, like shopping, food delivery and taxi-hailing.</p>
<p>Now it offers more than a million different services, mainly through mini apps that businesses develop to work within WeChat. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AliPay</a>, which also has more than a billion users, is similar. These two apps have been credited over the last decade with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/technology/alipay-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converting China from a cash-only economy</a> to one heavily reliant on digital payments, skipping over the intermediary phase of debit and credit cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept has also become popular in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/southeast-asias-battle-of-the-40-billion-superapps-11621332418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indonesia</a> and elsewhere in the region. The fact that they involve financial services, including payment options, is key, and the common thread that runs through many of the super apps’ services.</p>
<p>But while app use has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">exploded</a> in the United States and Europe; Big Tech players like Apple, Facebook and Google have added payment services; and several payment apps like Venmo and Square have become more popular, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/07/16/what-is-a-super-app-and-why-havent-they-gone-global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps have not yet emerged</a>.</p>
<p>This is partly because of data privacy regulations; privacy laws in the United States, and especially in Europe, limit data shared between apps, making it harder to create an ecosystem where mini apps can automatically integrate into super apps like Alipay.</p>
<p>It also stems from the U.S. having had a well-developed internet ecosystem, with popular social media sites, like Facebook, and payment sites, like PayPal, existing before the rise of smartphones, which resulted in each of these platforms launching separate apps, rather than one app offering multiple services. Compare that with China, where <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the internet was mobile-first,</a> arising only after the advent of smartphones. The U.S. market has long been used to separate platforms for separate tasks.</p>
<p>But many analysts point to apps and tech companies adding more services — like TikTok adding shopping, Snapchat integrating mini apps for games or Apple entering the payment space — and say that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738395/social-media-super-app-facebook-wechat-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps will eventually emerge</a> in the U.S., or at least bigger apps that can do more things. Adding more services to any one app, and finding a way to keep users on it, is also a way around privacy regulations that prevent one app from knowing what its users do on another app.</p>
<p>Apps are clearly on track to get bigger and more comprehensive, even though it is unlikely the U.S. would end up with only one or two dominant ones, as seen in Asian markets.</p>
<h2>The rise of DeFi</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, cryptocurrency developed alongside payment apps and super apps over the last decade. What started out as one product, Bitcoin, has developed into an <a href="https://qz.com/2065446/everything-you-need-to-know-about-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire peer-to-peer financial system, known as DeFi,</a> with several currencies, including Ethereum and Dogecoin, allowing users to invest, trade, spend and lend out money.</p>
<p>But despite its surge in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/13percent-of-americans-traded-crypto-in-the-past-year-survey-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity</a>, especially during the economic uncertainty posed by the COVID pandemic, and more<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/visa-launches-crypto-consulting-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> traditional financial institutions starting to offer some crypto-related services</a>, it remains <a href="https://www.ft.com/crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the mainstream financial system and sector,</a> with many experts saying it poses high risks. Crypto issuers have also long resisted regulation, as that would go against their goal of having a decentralized financial product.</p>
<p>But now things are starting to change, with some crypto platforms expressing interest in following regulation.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/coinbase-drops-plans-to-launch-interest-product-as-regulatory-tension-around-stablecoins-runs-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a plan to offer an interest-earning product, which would have allowed users to earn interest on coins loaned out to others,</a> after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to offer guidance on it and threatened to sue Coinbase if it released it. In fact, <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulation-talks-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto issuers are realizing that some regulation would give their product more legitimacy</a> and allow more people to use it for more purposes. This comes as new crypto products hit the market recently, including stable coins, which track the value of traditional currencies.</p>
<p>Regulation of crypto, an idea that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-gary-gensler-braces-for-clash-with-crypto-traders-11628164980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</a> has said he supports, along with some in Congress and some in the crypto industry, could indeed be on the horizon.</p>
<h2>Using cryptocurrency to fuel the first U.S. super app</h2>
<p>If crypto issuers work with government officials to set up regulation that protects consumers without limiting innovation, crypto is a good bet for what finally spurs American super apps.</p>
<p>Think about what could happen if Coinbase were to work with the SEC and align on smart regulation that would validate Coinbase as a viable and certified financial intermediary that users could rely on for crypto, embracing both its new financial products with potentially attractive yields in addition to its ability to use for everyday spending. Regulation would likely stabilize the currencies, turning them into something practical to shop with, rather than just hold for potential value. Such regulations would also eliminate some of the steps that add friction to current user experiences when it comes to using crypto in everyday life, like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long transaction times, high transaction fees</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-btc-flaws-set-stage-for-alternative-professor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large fluctuations in its value.</a></p>
<p>A regulatory framework would unlock massive demand for crypto, and there would suddenly be many businesses — from restaurants to retail – that would want a way to process crypto payments, spurring them to integrate into existing crypto payment apps and causing those to evolve into super apps. More people would also make deposits in crypto on these apps, rather than using traditional currencies in their banks. This would disrupt the entire economy and financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Banks have always produced products they think the public <em>wants</em> while the world of crypto and DeFi are clearly providing products and services that people <em>need, </em>and millions are already using them, despite their uncertain regulatory and legal status.</p>
<p>Just as ubiquitous and integrated digital payments quickly emerged in China to fill a need — a cash alternative in a market underserved by credit cards — crypto-based super apps would fulfill the needs of consumers and businesses looking for a secure and efficient way to use crypto instead of, or in addition to, traditional payment methods.</p>
<p>If crypto remains an unregulated gray zone, and its platforms remain isolated from the rest of economic and daily life, rather than evolve into super apps, the United States will miss the opportunity to build a new and innovative mobile- and digital-first financial ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into Google following complaints from news publishers who allege that the search giant is “abusing” its dominance in news aggregation to impose unfair conditions on the outlets.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India said Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws and pointed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">new rules</a> in France and Australia, where the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">has been asked</a> to enter into “fair/ good faith negotiation” with news publishers for paid licensing of content to address the “bargaining power imbalance between the two and the resultant imposition of unfair conditions by Google.”</p>
<p>“The allegations of the informant, when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google, makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google. Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation,” the CCI said in its 21-page order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The probe follows a complaint from Digital News Publishers Association, which consists of the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media firms. The association said their members get more than half of their traffic from online search engines, a category Google clearly commands, and the market leading position has allowed Google to force the publishers into several unfavorable terms.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging complaint, the association said Google displaying snippets of news items limits the number of visitors to news outlets and impacts the ad revenue “while Google continue[s] to earn ad revenue on its result page&#8221; as well as enriches &#8220;its search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries.”</p>
<p>“It has also been averred that the terms of the agreements entered between the members of the Informant [news publishers] and the OPs [Google and its subsidiaries] for sharing the advertisement revenues are unilaterally and arbitrarily dictated by the OPs, and the members of the Informant have no other option but to accept the terms, as they are, with no bargaining power whatsoever,” the watchdog said.</p>
<p>“The only alternate to the AMP system is for publishers to subscribe with Google, which benefits Google, to the detriment of the publishers,” the watchdog said. The association accused that Google forcing them to use its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/google-am-baidu-sogou/">AMP format</a>, which has implications on their revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders,&#8221; the watchdog added.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s investigation is the latest of a series of probes the Indian competition watchdog has ordered in recent weeks. Late last year, the CCI ordered an investigation into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/india-antitrust-watchdog-orders-investigation-into-apples-business-practices/">how Apple runs its App Store</a>, becoming the most recent country to take aim at the American technology giant.</p>

<p>In 1992, Ward Cunningham coined the metaphor &#8220;technical debt&#8221; to highlight how businesses weigh their short-term gains against the long-term viability of a software product. Business dynamics have evolved a lot since then, but the metaphor still works.</p>
<p>Favoring a short-term plan to get a faster go-to-market option is not always bad, provided the business has a backup plan to deliver well-designed code that would simplify future iterations and innovations.</p>
<p>But for startups, reworking is difficult as deadlines and resource crunch prevent developers from producing clean and perfect code. Startups prioritize short-term plans and focus more on adding functionalities to achieve milestones, sign up marquee customers or raise funding. This roadmap shuffling and disregard for the long-term view trigger tech debt.</p>
<p>I have worked closely with more than 25 startups and learned a lot from their journey from early-stage to growth stage. I have realized that avoiding tech debts becomes easier with some ground rules.</p>
<p>Here are four rules that startups should follow to avoid tech debt:</p>
<h2>Don’t let specific implementations continue for over three months</h2>
<p>Startups often try to customize their product to meet their marquee customers’ demands. Sometimes this leads to two products — a generalized version and a customer-specific one, and converging them becomes difficult over time.</p>
<p>To stay on track, companies start cutting corners, which destabilizes the product. I have seen engineering teams work on customization for a whole year and then lose 20 months in merging and stabilizing the core product.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The foundation of any software product is directly responsible for better scaling and maintainability.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Startups generally work with an 18-24 month runway before they raise the next level of funding. If they rework to generalize features, they could lose a costly quarter to stabilization.</p>
<h3>What to do:</h3>
<p>When teams work on custom features for more than the specified timeline, merging them back with the core product becomes complex. It is better to acknowledge that products cannot be customer-specific at the very beginning. Startups should consider the platform and think about future maintainability upfront.</p>

		Arthur Woods is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.mathison.io/">Mathison</a>, a venture-backed technology platform equipping employers with everything they need to manage their diversity hiring efforts. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We find ourselves amid the largest talent shortage in history after a year in which countless organizations voiced their commitments to diversity. Yet few have made much progress &#8212; and 76% of <a href="https://joshbersin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/202102-DEI-Report_Final_V2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizations</a> have still not set diversity goals for 2022.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we’ve been <a href="http://hiringfordiversity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying the hiring practices</a> of hundreds of employers and written about the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-great-resignation-doesnt-have-to-threaten-your-dei-efforts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of the Great Resignation on DEI</a>. We’ve found a consistent pattern across the board: Employers are anchoring the focus to lagging indicators around diversity that won’t influence any change.</p>
<h2>What are the missing metrics for DEI?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, organizations have focused their DEI efforts — including goals and measurements — on increasing diversity and a sense of belonging on their teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250811" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The challenge? These two metrics are centered completely around end outcomes without accounting for the actual activities necessary to achieve them. Most organizations are missing a theory of change for their diversity efforts to account for what actions need to happen to move the needle in a meaningful way. This depends on answering two new questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are our systems equitable?</strong> This is the extent to which our processes are fair, consistent and accessible for everyone, directly impacting whether people advance.</li>
<li><strong>Are our people aware, engaged and accountable for DEI? </strong>This is the collective awareness, engagement and accountability for DEI across our teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Putting these new metrics into practice</h2>
<p>It is clear that the challenges are daunting and creating roadblocks to change, but for those who want to be part of the 24% setting diversity goals this year, here are three key areas that can help transform the landscape for DEI in 2022:</p>
<h3>Measure the current state of diversity to learn where to focus your goals</h3>
<p>Organizations often set unrealistic DEI goals — either too ambitious or not challenging enough. Before you create your DEI goals, you’ll have to figure out where you have gaps and what you should prioritize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess your existing organizational policies and practices to determine where you have gaps or potential for bias by walking through the candidate and employee journey. Solutions like our <a href="https://www.mathison.io/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equal Hiring Index</a> can help you gain a complete picture in these areas.</li>
<li>Examine the current diversity representation of your existing team and the extent to which your team is included and engaged in DEI efforts through an anonymous survey.</li>
<li>Use the combined insights above to determine up to five areas where you have the most opportunity to improve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensure your DEI goals holistically account for diversity, equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>Since employers typically only center their DEI goals around increasing representation, ensure your goals are holistic to also account for your people, processes and representation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Identify your greatest gaps and opportunities in improving the equity and accessibility in your hiring and talent process.</li>
<li>Identify the critical path in your team’s involvement in this effort, starting with awareness and followed by being equipped, engaged and accountable.</li>
<li>Identify where you have the greatest opportunity to increase representation: You may choose to address this goal with a framework or process-based goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bring your team on board from the beginning</h3>
<p>In the spirit of the true inclusion of your team in these goals, you will want to ensure they are part of building them from the start. This is how you’ll create excitement and accountability around reaching these goals. Here are some ways to bring your team on board in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create shared ownership by including your team in goal-setting meetings and conversations, whether through direct involvement or through working groups.</li>
<li>Listen to your team’s vision for DEI and be sure to engage your existing employee resource groups or diversity councils, if you have them, and learn where their passions lie.</li>
<li>Create a system to track and report DEI progress.</li>
<li>Make reports and goals available to employees and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Make goals and data available to everyone internally and, if possible, share externally.</li>
<li>Distribute DEI accountability across the whole organization.</li>
<li>Reward your team for hitting DEI milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A call to action for 2022</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, we can’t manage what we can’t measure. As we step back to consider our diversity efforts, it’s clear that measuring outcomes alone doesn’t ensure we make progress on them. Instead, we need to focus on the actual activities necessary to drive the change we want to see &#8212; the equity of our systems and inclusion of our people.</p>
<p>With the new year beginning, this is the perfect time to have a conversation with our teams on the new goals we can set. Let’s make 2022 not only a year when we measure diversity outcomes — let’s actually advance them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we didn’t make it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a> in person this year, we certainly heard about the “eMobility Experience,” a test track for demo rides of all the e-scooters, e-bikes and whatever other micromobility vehicles came to play in Las Vegas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of products were shown, many of which weren’t actually new, like Bird’s new consumer suite of vehicles (the Bird Bike, Bird Flex and Birdie), Zoomo’s utility electric-assist bikes, Euphree’s City Robin step-through e-bike and Arevo and Superstrata’s 3D-printed carbon fiber e-bikes. There were a handful of interesting companies showing off new versions of their electric scooters, bikes, motorcycles and connected tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main theme throughout this year is smart, connected vehicles. These little EVs are being built with more powerful onboard computers that are synced up to apps that can help riders do things like find their vehicle, track fitness goals and control bike functions like locks and lights. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254889" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of new bikes, scooters and some connected tech that came to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a>.</p>
<h2>Segway</h2>

<p><b>Segway</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric micromobility manufacturer that not only sells personal vehicles but also supplies a number of the world’s shared operators with vehicles, came to CES with a new kick scooter line, the P-Series, and a new moped-type e-scooter, the E11a. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The P60 and P100S scooters have wider footboards and handles, automobile-grade all-season tires, and front- and rear-spring suspension. They’ve also got turn signaling, a tail light and multiple ways to lock and unlock the vehicle. The E110a has room for two, plenty of storage space and lots of smart features, according to the company. Segway didn’t share more info on what exactly those smart features were, but if it’s anything like its last generation, it’ll have a battery management system and the ability to connect to smartphones and thus the Segway-Ninebot app.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The Swedish maker of lightweight electric motorbikes brought its &#8220;CAKE :work series&#8221; to the U.S. for the first time. This series of professional motorbikes have been shown before, just not in the states. The bigger <strong>Cake</strong> news during CES involved updates to its Ridecake connectivity app, including features to allow professional fleet managers to monitor and manage their vehicles.</p>
<p>The new connectivity features are available to all riders with a data service-enabled Cake Connect module on their vehicles; this includes all current and upcoming models, as well as a majority of the existing Cake bikes. The update to the app will add customized ride modes, real-time riding information, ride history and anti-theft security.</p>
<p>Professionals using Cake&#8217;s cloud-based management system will get real-time data, including live location of their fleet with position of all bikes, mileage, range and battery status for all bikes, and access to diagnostic data. Over the air, the system will also allow for firmware updates, access to anti-theft functionality and setting custom ride modes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American-Ukrainian startup </span><b>Delfast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out an upgraded model of its electric Top 3.0 bike, which the company claims can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. The smart bike has an onboard computer that can be set to receive software updates and immobilize the vehicle for theft-protection. It also can sync with Delfast’s new mobile app to provide on-demand analytics, lock and unlock the bike, arm and disarm the bike alarm, track total mileage, odometer and speedometer metrics, monitor the bike power and estimate range, locate the bike, control lighting and other smart features.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese e-scooter company </span><b>Niu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed up this year with its new <a href="https://www.niu.com/en/ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BQi-C1 e-bike</a>, a vehicle the company has already teased but finally shared pricing and tech specs at CES. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The step-through bike is powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear and can reach top speeds of 28 miles per hour in the U.S. Stricter e-bike regulations in Europe mean that those versions will have just a 250W motor and a top speed of 15.5 miles per hour. The U.S. version will have both a throttle and a pedal assist, while the European version just has pedal assist. The BQi will also be app-connected and feature many smart security features. It’ll be priced at $1,499 in the U.S., which is a pretty good deal for such a powerful e-bike. </span></p>
<h2>Okai</h2>
<p>[gallery ids="2254901,2254896,2254899,2254897,2254898,2254900"]</p>
<p><b>Okai</b>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">another Chinese manufacturer that supplies vehicles to many big-name shared operators, came to CES with five products, but only one of three can be ridden. Let’s start there. The EB20 e-bike is made from professional-grade mountain bike components with a lightweight carbon fiber frame. It’s a 12-speed bike with a 750W motor, swappable Samsung batteries and a large 2.8-inch LED touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okai also launched its ES600 sharing e-scooter to address the needs of the growing scooter-share industry. It features a swappable battery system with built-in handles on each battery, optimized weight distribution, a low center of gravity and a hydraulic suspension system. It also has side and front light indicators, LED headlights and taillights and side-mounted reflectors. The ES800 is an off-road performance scooter with a serious 1800W motor, 12-inch off-road tires, a 35% incline climb rate and dual shock absorbers. The weight of this heavy-duty vehicle is 30% heavier than most e-scooters to provide more stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, onto the products you can’t ride. Okai unveiled its SH10 smart helmet, made with antibacterial materials, to make for a safer and more hygienic commute. These are likely also geared toward the shared audience that are increasingly being required by cities to include helmets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The helmet is integrated with Bluetooth to connect to the Okai app, from which riders can customize and configure front and rear LED displays to improve visibility. A smart integrated speaker also allows riders to listen to music without affecting aural awareness on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Okai came to Vegas with its SP10 Smart Backpack that features an ultraviolet light disinfection chamber, a fingerprint sensor for secure access, integrated device charging and a customizable RGB strip that can be synced with the vehicle status. </span></p>
<h2>Bosch</h2>
<p><b>Bosch </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up with its connected smart e-bike system, which isn’t exactly new, but it was awarded honoree status at the CES Innovation Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system consists of the eBike Flow app that acts as a key, a control unit, display, rechargeable battery and drive unit. Like others at CES, the connected bike can be updated over-the-air, record personal ride info and fitness data, customize riding modes and display information like battery charge status and next service appointment on the home screen. </span></p>
<h2>Moonbikes</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255031" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255031" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255031" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg" alt="moonbikes electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="700" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Moonbikes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just to keep things interesting, there was <strong>Moonbikes</strong>. Now, again,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/"> the company’s electric snow vehicle is not exactly new</a>, but CES was really the first time people really got to check it out in person. It’s a single-track snowmobile that has a 3 kW (4hp) electric motor and reaches a 26 mile-per-hour top speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only 182 pounds, it’s much lighter than your traditional snowmobile, which might make it easier to maneuver and play around on. It’s designed with a snow track on the rear and a single ski in front, and its battery can go about 12 miles in sport mode or 22 miles in eco mode. A full charge would take about five hours. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Fitness+ is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> a new &#8220;Collections&#8221; feature along with a new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series starting on January 10th. Collections are a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach a goal. The feature draws on nearly 2,000 workouts to give users a new way to get motivated as they begin their next workout. Apple says Collections will give users a suggested plan to help them make specific training choices.</p>
<p>The six Collections that will be available at launch include &#8220;30-Day Core Challenge,&#8221; &#8220;Improve Your Posture with Pilates,&#8221; &#8220;Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses,&#8221; &#8220;Run Your First 5K,&#8221; &#8220;Strengthen Your Back, Strech Your Hips&#8221; and &#8220;Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series is an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist/">&#8220;Time to Walk&#8221; feature</a> that launched last year. The company describes the new series as an audio running experience designed to help users train to become more consistent and better runners. Each episode in the series is focused on a popular running route and includes coaching tips led by a Fitness+ trainer. The episodes feature playlists designed to match each run&#8217;s intensity, location and coaching. Each episode also includes photos taken by the Fitness+ trainer depicting the route.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Time to Run is launching with three episodes: London, coached by Cory Wharton-Malcolm; Brooklyn, coached by Emily Fayette; and Miami Beach, coached by Sam Sanchez. A new episode of the series will be released each week on Mondays. Apple notes that for Apple Watch customers who use a wheelchair, Time to Run becomes Time to Run or Push and gives users the option to begin an &#8220;Outdoor Push Running Pace&#8221; workout.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255039" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255039" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>“At the beginning of a new year, we know many people are looking for new ways to go after their goals,&#8221; said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of fitness technologies, in a statement. &#8220;With these new additions, Fitness+ makes it easy to get motivated and stay active anywhere, with the most complete library of high-quality and diverse content to train your mind and body, no matter where you are on your fitness journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Collections and Time to Run launching on January 10th, Apple is introducing the third season of Time to Walk, its series that aims to encourage users to get active by walking more often. New guests will be added each week in the third season. The guests include Hasan Minhaj, Chelsea Handler, Bernice A. King and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitness+ is also adding additional content to its Artist Spotlight series, which dedicates an entire workout playlist to one artist, with new workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira and the Beatles. The workout types include cycling, dance, HIIT, strength, treadmill and yoga.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-fitness-launches-on-december-14/">launched</a> Fitness+ on December 14, 2020, and has since worked to compete with other subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Fitness+ is available as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standalone subscription</a> for $9.99 per month, or as a part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple One Premier</a> plan for $29.95 per month, which gives users access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud+ with 2TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning private-market powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $9 billion in new capital for its venture capital, growth-stage and biotech-focused vehicles.</p>
<p>The firm, better known by the moniker a16z, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">raised a $2.2 billion crypto-focused fund last year</a>.</p>
<p>These fundraises by the firm highlight the rising size of private-market investing vehicles that we tend to group under the venture capital banner, and the burgeoning capital base of a16z itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Looking back in time, the group&#8217;s <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/11/20/fund-vii-and-growth-fund-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last generation of funds</a> &#8212; including its seventh venture fund worth $1.3 billion, its second growth fund worth $3.2 billion and its third <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">bio-focused fund</a> worth $750 million &#8212; were worth just a touch over half of its latest aggregate fundraise. So, it appears that a16z is not only reloading, it&#8217;s raising more capital than ever for its usual crop of focuses.</p>
<p>That the group is raising larger investment capital pools should not surprise. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">first crypto fund</a> was worth $300 million, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">second $515 million</a> and its most recent around four times that much. As an investing collective, a16z, like many private-market investors, is putting more capital to work per new crop of new funds.</p>
<p>The trend of larger funds is generally thought to be a contributing factor to larger startup funding rounds, and some of the pressure regarding deal access (harder) and startup valuations (higher).</p>
<p>To underscore just how big venture and venture-ish funds are today, recall that Norwest Venture Partners closed a $3 billion fund last month. That pushed the group&#8217;s total capital it has raised &#8220;across the decades&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/norwest-unveils-a-3-billion-fund-which-is-a-whopping-one-fourth-the-capital-it-has-ever-raised/">as our own Connie Loizos put it</a>, to $12.5 billion. So, a huge fraction of the firm&#8217;s historical capital was raised just last quarter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a capital arms race in the private markets, as enthusiasm for technology companies both traditional (software, etc.) and frontier (crypto, quantum computing, metaverse, etc.) remains red-hot. That the public markets are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">taking a slightly different tack in recent weeks</a> doesn&#8217;t appear to have slowed the venture capital firm side of the fundraising coin. Not yet, at least.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2021 wound down, The Exchange wanted to dig into what might happen if the startup music stopped playing. So we got veteran venture capitalist <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph?lang=en">Matt Murphy</a> on the phone to talk it over.</p>
<p>Murphy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-murphy-0415543/">started his career</a> at Sun Microsystems back in the mid-90s, joining venture shop <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a> in 1999, where he stayed until 2015. From there, the investor changed teams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/menlo-ventures-brings-on-matt-murphy/">to Menlo Ventures</a>, where he&#8217;s worked since. For a little bit of context, Murphy has invested in DocuSign, Egnyte, AppDynamics and Carta, among others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most relevant today is his experience investing during downturns, including both the 2000-era startup contraction and the 2008 financial crisis. So, armed with a grip of questions and a recorder, we talked through a host of topics, from current startup benchmarks to the durability of today’s startups and changes to the overall startup hit rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our chat with Murphy was wide-ranging.

<h3>On whether the current period is overheated or backed by fundamentals</h3>
<p><strong>Matt Murphy:</strong> Well, I&#8217;m very OK with the investments I&#8217;ve already made being marked up, because that makes you feel like a hero, and very traumatized by trying to get into new stuff, because that makes you feel like a chump. [Laughter]</p>
<p>[But yes,] the way that valuations have changed and continue to change in a relatively short period of time has been astonishing. Definitely more so than in 1999. It just feels like this has been more of a durable period. It&#8217;s more distributed, and every time you think it&#8217;s a new max, something else happens.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Alán Jaime Misrahi grew up devoted to soccer, eventually playing in Mexico&#8217;s third division. While he didn’t necessarily make it to the “big leagues” playing the sport, his new company Draftea aims to win over the 350 million sports fans in Latin America, Jaime Misrahi told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea, which calls itself the first daily fantasy sports company in Spanish-speaking Latin America, emerged from stealth mode today on the heels of a $13.2 million fundraise led by Kaszek with participation from Sequoia, Bullpen, and Nigel Eccles, founder and former CEO of sports-betting giant FanDuel. Eccles serves as chairman of the board at Draftea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Sequoia’s first in a company headquartered in Mexico, half a year after the venture capital firm </span><a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to double down on opportunities in Latin America. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea’s app charges sports fans a fee to draft a lineup of players and compete to win daily cash prizes. The platform, currently in private beta mode, will launch sometime in the first quarter of this year. It will first host Mexican fantasy soccer matches, though Jaime Misrahi said the company aims to eventually add offerings until it hosts fantasy games for “every single sport in the world.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think of a region where soccer is almost a religion, where people get together for activities that are related to sports, where stadiums are full, where people enjoy [sports] as a family tradition, where people are in several WhatsApp groups talking about sports and fantasy – we want to bring all that together,” Jaime Misrahi said of Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sports betting platforms </span><a href="https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-adds-its-first-latin-american-sports-betting-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Costa Rica’s Betcris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already popular in the region, Jaime Misrahi said Draftea is comparatively a “much more social platform.” It also differentiates itself by offering daily games and interactions, in contrast to the less-frequent games hosted by seasonal fantasy platforms that tend to mirror real-world sports schedules.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Jaime Misrahi, the core founding team includes Alejandra Lascurain, former product head at Mexico’s largest neobank; Miguel Gutiérrez-Barquín, who previously led growth at Rappi; Joe Cohen, Vercel’s former head of engineering; and Andreas Assad, who worked at EA Sports. Draftea has 34 employees in total today and plans to double in size over the next couple months across all key areas, Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is looking ahead to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar this November, expected to be this year’s biggest live sports event worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to, by then, have an amazing product, have launched in many countries in Latin America, and to have hundreds, if not thousands or millions, of users engaged with our platform,” Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia’s Konstantine Buhler met Jaime Misrahi through a mutual connection at Stanford, where Jaime Misrahi completed his MBA last year. Buhler led Sequoia’s investment in Draftea, in part because he felt Jaime Misrahi exemplified “founder-market fit” due to his passion for sports and experience as a professional soccer player, Buhler told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It all comes down to customer love,” Buhler wrote. “Draftea is a first-of-its-kind community for sports fans in LatAm where they can become the protagonist in their favorite games. We believe Alán and team will quickly capture the hearts of fans in Mexico then expand to other countries in time for the World Cup.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">has been working</a> on Spaces Recordings, a feature that will let hosts share tweets with audio recordings of past Spaces. Now, when hosts share the recordings, they&#8217;re able to see how many listeners joined live, as well as how many people replayed the recording after the fact.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">we’ve been working on Spaces Recordings and if you’re a Host with access, you’ll now see how many listeners joined live AND how many people replayed the recording</p>

<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1479173213032792065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson said that the long-teased feature will remain in closed testing for a bit longer, but that they have expanded the testing group a few times since launch. Twitter does intend on rolling out this feature more widely in the future.</p>
<p>When a Space is being recorded, users in the live space will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it. If a host shares the recording later, they can edit the start time so that future listeners don&#8217;t have to hear minutes of dead air if the Space didn&#8217;t start right away. When listening to a recorded Space, users can see who&#8217;s talking and who was in the room, similar to in a live Space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some updates on recorded Spaces:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>These features are useful for listeners, since they&#8217;re able to asynchronously engage with content that they may miss from their favorite hosts. But for the hosts themselves, this replay feature makes it easier to build an audience. Clubhouse added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">similar feature</a> in November called Replay, which also lets users download audio so they can edit it and share it as a podcast if they so choose. Since June, Twitter has let users <a href="https://twitter.com/twittermedia/status/1405262233299345413?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> their Spaces audio files from the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Spaces has become a staple of Twitter, even occupying the center tab on its mobile app. But the growth of the live audio feature hasn&#8217;t come without setbacks. Recently, Twitter Spaces users have reported being served <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly harmful content</a> — including Spaces with racist titles that remained on their feeds even after being reported. Other live audio apps like Clubhouse have also <a href="https://www.thelily.com/women-in-tech-are-networking-through-clubhouse-an-invite-only-app-but-these-black-women-say-its-not-a-place-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with moderating</a> hateful content. Twitter hasn’t yet detailed if or how its moderation of Spaces will expand beyond its existing reporting features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re exploring more proactive detection and working on evaluating and developing new moderation options,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spaces is an iterative product and as more people use it, we’ll continue to learn, thoughtfully listen and make improvements based on feedback.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gnawing, burrowing, infecting: The damages caused to agriculture by insect pests like the Japanese beetle (pictured above) exceed $100 billion every year,<a href="http://www.researchtrends.net/tia/article_pdf.asp?in=0&amp;vn=11&amp;tid=20&amp;aid=5731"> according</a> to the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA. And along with plant diseases, which the exoskeleton buggers can also transmit, arthropods account for the annual<a href="https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1187738/icode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40% loss</a> of agricultural production worldwide.</p>
<p>Enter FarmSense, a Riverside, California-based agtech startup attempting to solve the insect pest problem. The company creates optical sensors and novel classification systems based on machine learning algorithms to identify and track insects in real time. The key here: real-time information.</p>
<p>They claim real-time information provided by their sensors allows for early detection and thus the timely deployment of pest-management tools, such as insecticide or biocontrols. The current mechanical traps used for monitoring may only yield important intel 10 to 14 days after the bugs’ arrival.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Some of these bugs only live as adults for like five days, so by the time you know you have a problem, the problem has already taken root and is now a bigger problem,” said Eamonn Keogh, a co-founder of FarmSense. “Had you known about it in real time, you could have localized the intervention to just one location and had a much better outcome, saving pesticide, saving labor and saving the crop from being damaged.”</p>
<p>How they can provide the information critical for achieving those better outcomes is a bit complicated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254313" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254313" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2254313" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg" alt="FarmSense FlightSensor" width="800" height="1067" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254313" class="wp-caption-text">FarmSense’s new optical sensor &#8212; dubbed the FlightSensor &#8212; seen out in the field. The sensor promises to provide real-time data, as well as management strategies to help farmers mitigate damage from harmful insects. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> FarmSense</p></div></p>
<p>Currently being tested and researched in almond orchards in Southern California thanks to a Small Business Innovation Research grant, their newest sensor, termed the FlightSensor, is best understood when considering where Keogh got the idea for it: James Bond and Cold War espionage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keogh explained how Russian spies would use lasers, poised on glass window panes, to pick up on vibrations caused by people’s voices. Then a sensor would translate that information, providing rough intel on what was going on in the room.</p>
<p>“With the same kind of trick in mind, I imagined what would happen if a bug flew past a laser&#8230; you would hear just the bug and nothing else.”</p>
<p>However, instead of reading vibrations, the FlightSensor uses light curtains and shadows within a small tunnel that the insects are drawn into by attractants. On one side of the sensor is a light source and on the other the optical sensor. The sensor measures how much light is occluded, or rather how much makes it across, when an insect flies inside. That data is turned into audio and analyzed by machine learning algorithms in the cloud.</p>
<p>According to FarmSense, the sensor, which is designed to look like old analog devices for ease-of-use by growers, does not pick up on ambient noises, such as wind or rainfall.</p>
<p>“The quality of the signal is so beautifully clear and it&#8217;s so deaf to the ambient sounds normally heard in the field,” Keogh said. “It&#8217;s essentially a different modality to hear the insect, but when you put on headphones and listen to the audio clip from the sensor, it sounds just like a mosquito or a bee flying around.”</p>
<p>Keogh, a professor of computer science and engineering at UC Riverside, specializes in data mining and works on the novel machine learning algorithms that FarmSense employs for identification purposes. Assisting on the development and deployment are entomologists and field specialists, including co-founder Leslie Hickle.</p>
<p>Shailendra Singh &#8212; the company’s CEO who has developed systems for wireless and cellular networks as well as security &#8212; works on the hardware side. He provided a working price point for each sensor, which will be billed by the season, at $300.</p>
<p>The impact of this technology is clear. For farmers tending to fields large and small, real-time information on insects would not only be important for their financial security, but would also allow them to potentially conserve and protect critical resources, such as soil health.</p>
<p>But FarmSense claims it wants to empower rural farmers who they say are disproportionately impacted by the damages caused by insects.</p>
<p>Yet $300 per sensor per season is stiff, posing a potential risk to adoption and, thus, to the tech’s ability to even solve the issue of insect damage in the first place.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things for small scale-farmers is managing risk, said Michael Carter, the director of the USDA-funded Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk, and Resilience and distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis.</p>
<p>“Risk can keep people poor. It disincentives investment in technologies that would raise income on average, because the future is unknown,” Carter said. “People with low wealth obviously don’t have a lot of savings, but they can’t risk the savings to invest in something that might improve their income that also might cause their family to starve.”</p>
<p>However, he was optimistic that technology like the FlightSensor could alleviate investment dread for small-scale farmers, particularly if the tech were paired with insurance to further protect them.</p>

<p>The technology also raises this question: Is real-time identification really the best option for pest management? Speaking to research entomologist Andrew Lieb of the USDA Forest Service, it might not be. He explained that the primary drivers of invasive insects &#8212; typically the most destructive to both agriculture and forests &#8212; are travel and trade.</p>
<p>He expressed optimism for technology as a way to control insect establishment, but ultimately thinks that the optimal strategy is to attack the problem even earlier. We should address current import and export laws, how products are treated to remove pests and perhaps even pass travel prohibitions.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it is beyond doubt that FarmSense’s technology is poised for impact. Even thinking beyond addressing financial insecurity for farmers and threats to our global food chains, it might prove useful in tracking and spreading critical information about disease-vectoring insects, like mosquitoes.</p>
<p>And with the continual disruption caused by COVID-19, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine a world that isn’t keenly aware of how biosecurity’s successes &#8212; or failures &#8212; ripple throughout our myriad systems.</p>
<p>Looking at how non-native insect invasions are expected to increase by<a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/news/release/non-native-insect-invasions-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 36% by 2050</a> and how growing population numbers are going to put greater pressure on food production, innovative tech like the FlightSensor that advances our capacity to understand and thoughtfully respond to threats is more than welcome.</p>
<p>As Carter said about all of the possible ways in which agtech still stands to benefit agriculture, “we need to be creative at those margins.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update: </strong><em>Tech stocks have given up all gains since this post went up, with both the Nasdaq and the basket of software stocks we track in the red. From a slightly later perspective, concern about near full-employment and resulting rising interest rates appears to have won the in-market sentiment battle.</em></p>
<p>The relationship between economic news and the value of technology stocks has been a fun puzzle in recent months.</p>
<p>You might think that strong jobs reports, for example, would lead to general economic optimism and, therefore, upward movements for technology stocks. And you might also expect that poor economic data would lead to general economic pessimism, and therefore downward movement for technology stocks. You know, because tech is a big part of the present-day economy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ha, no. Well, partially yes, but also no.</p>
<p>Heading into <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/december-2021-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-usa-192453058.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today&#8217;s jobs report</a>, there was a specter hanging over the markets. Namely, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/the-fed-is-scaring-markets-with-the-triple-threat-of-policy-tightening.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin to tighten monetary policy this year</a>, perhaps through the end of its bond-buying program, cutting its balance sheet and raising rates. The result of the Fed tightening rates is that bonds and other lower-risk assets would become more attractive. At the same time, rising rates are expected to make expensive tech stocks less attractive given risk-adjusted return evolution.</p>
<p>Given that dynamic, you might expect that a strong jobs report today would mean that tech stocks would go down, and a jobs report miss would mean that tech stocks would go up. That almost happened. Today&#8217;s December jobs data missed (199,000 net new jobs reported, about half of expectations) and tech stocks <em>initially</em> sold off. But then when markets opened, they ripped higher, with the Nasdaq up 0.34% &#8212; while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down a fraction &#8212; and software stocks are up around 0.8%.</p>
<p>Why the drop and then bounce in tech stock value?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/conorsen/status/1479454159313195016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern that</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1479455915833241606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&#8217;ve effectively reached full employment</a>. Which could mean that the lackluster December jobs number was not driven entirely by a lack of employer demand, but also in part due to a lack of worker supply. (The fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsojourner/status/1479447236299919369">we remain in a global pandemic plays into this dynamic</a>, of course</p>
<p>We find ourselves, then, in the weird situation when a poor jobs report could indicate that the economy is stronger (closer to full employment) than anticipated, implying that wages and prices will continue to rise, inducing the Fed to raise rates. Which, as noted above, would mean that higher-risk assets would sell off and less risky assets would become more attractive. And yet tech stocks are a touch higher because, well, it appears that the markets are deciding that the poor-ish report will net out positive for tech shares, which have sold off sharply in recent weeks. Or that the lackluster jobs report will prove less Fed-provoking than a strong jobs report, in essence.</p>
<p>So, tech stocks are higher today and everyone who works in the industry gets a little wealth bump.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pendulumfn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendulum</a> helps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.9 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Cercano Management and others. The service was incubated inside Madrona Venture Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pendulum’s platform applies AI and NLP technologies to uncover threats and opportunities contained in narratives in the earliest days of their formation and track them as they spread online,&#8221; explains Madrona managing director Hope Cochran. &#8220;By dissecting and categorizing the narratives in text, video and audio content on social media platforms, companies are better prepared and able to engage with communities as they choose. With support for YouTube, BitChute, Rumble and Podcasts currently available, the platform will grow to encompass all social platforms of importance over the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind Pendulum seems uniquely suited to build a product like that. Co-founder Sam Clark, for example, previously worked as a data mining engineer at Decide.com and then at eBay after it acquired that company. He also co-created <a href="https://transparency.tube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transparency Tube</a>, a project that categorizes and analyzes political YouTube channels. Transparency Tube shares quite a bit of DNA with Pendulum, and Clark then teamed up with Madrona to build a commercial product around this general idea of tracking mis- and disinformation online. That&#8217;s also where he teamed up with his co-founder Mark Listes, who brings a lot of government experience to the team. Listes was previously the director of policy for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the chief of staff for the National Security Innovation Network, where he helped manage the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s venture engagement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254835" style="width: 822px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254835" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg" alt="" width="812" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254835" class="wp-caption-text">Pendulum co-founders Sam Clark (l) and Mark Listes (r). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p>
<p>While Listes expected to have a pretty calm time at the Election Assistance Commission, he obviously picked the wrong time for that when he joined in 2016. &#8220;By November and December of &#8217;16, the elections space looked a lot different,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;We were dealing with foreign interference and intelligence briefs and everything under the sun. Long story short, over the next two and a half years, I and my colleagues got right in the middle of leading the effort for fighting foreign interference out of our election system. We experienced it both personally and organizationally, and then helped fight to get out of our overall system. Harmful narratives and the impact that narratives, whether they&#8217;re mis- or disinformation or malaligned narratives can have on society at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet while Pendulum can be used by government agencies to track online narratives, it&#8217;s a commercial service first. &#8220;We&#8217;re commercial first,&#8221; Listes said. &#8220;There&#8217;s of course an easy, intuitive government play here, but we&#8217;re actually focusing exclusively on the commercial sector first and we&#8217;re building out some really powerful partnerships there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254834" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listes stressed that for a platform like Pendulum to work, it has to cover as many platforms as possible. It&#8217;s not enough to simply track Twitter, which doesn&#8217;t offer a representative sample of the population anyway, or YouTube. Because of this, Pendulum also tracks BitChute and Rumble, for example.</p>
<p>But Listes also noted that Pendulum isn&#8217;t in the business of adjudicating truth. &#8220;We actually have this really strong powerful narrative tracking engine that is not reliant on whether or not something&#8217;s true or false,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re staying away from truth adjudication &#8212; and that opens us up to a wider range of use cases.&#8221; That means the company can work with corporations, for example, which may want to track narratives around a company&#8217;s executives and assets, for communications but also security reasons.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&#8217;t want to decide whether something is true or not, Pendulum opens itself up for use by nefarious actors as well. Listes argues that the company doesn&#8217;t track any personal identifiable information, though, and that the team is quite cognizant of this possibility. &#8220;We&#8217;re building values to make sure that we&#8217;re not ever in any way creating an unfair playing field or empowering malicious actors and things like that through the use of our tool,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finalsite, an internet software house that provides school districts with website design, hosting and content management solutions, has been hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, school districts whose websites are hosted by Finalsite discovered that they were no longer accessible or displayed errors. While at the time Finalsite blamed the issues on “performance difficulties” across different services, the Glastonbury, Connecticut-based company has since confirmed the outage was caused by ransomware.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Tuesday, January 4, our team identified the presence of ransomware on certain systems in our environment,” <a href="https://status.finalsite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company said in a statement</a>. “We immediately took steps to secure our systems and to contain the activity. We quickly launched an investigation into the event with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, and began proactively taking certain systems offline.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254983" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Finalsite spokesperson Morgan Delack told TechCrunch that 5,000 of its total 8,000 global customers — including school districts in Kansas City, Illinois and Missouri — are affected by the incident. In addition to website outages, one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rxnze3/thousands_of_school_websites_have_been_down_for_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> the incident also prevented some schools from sending email notifications about school closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>
<p>In its latest status update, Finalsite says the &#8220;vast majority of front-facing websites are online,&#8221; though notes that “some sites may still lack proper styling, admin log-in functionality, calendar events, or constituent directories.&#8221; One Finalsite customer, the Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://twitter.com/HGPAlumni/status/1479454006300880897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> on Friday that while its website is back online, registration forms and the email system remain unavailable.</p>
<p>The Finalsite spokesperson said the company took its customers&#8217; sites offline upon noticing a problem and rebuilt its system in a clean environment from the ground up. “That is why it is taking time to get everyone back online,” she said. “The malware issue is not what caused sites to go down — we took them down to protect our client’s data.&#8221;</p>
<p>It remains unclear how attackers gained access to Finalist’s systems, and it’s not yet known what type of ransomware was used in the attack. The company tells TechCrunch that it continues to work with a forensic specialist to complete a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The company said there is “no evidence” that any data was taken as a result of the ransomware attack, but the spokesperson declined to say if Finalsite has the means — such as logs — to detect the exfiltration of data, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>Educational institutions and their providers have become a popular target of threat actors since the start of the pandemic, which saw many shift to online-based remote learning. Last September, for example, Washington, D.C’s Howard University was forced to cancel classes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/howard-university-cancels-classes-after-ransomware-attack/">after falling victim to a ransomware attack.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Reinhardt spent the last decade as CEO at <a href="http://segment.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segment</a> helping to build the customer data platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">selling it to Twilio</a> for $3.2 billion along the way. Today, Reinhardt announced he was leaving Twilio to be full-time CEO at <a href="https://www.charmindustrial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charm Industrial</a>, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Reinhardt expressed mixed emotions about leaving, calling it bitter sweet, but believes that working on the global climate crisis is something that demands his attention now. Steve Davito, Twilio Segment’s go-to-market leader, will take over for him, according to the company.</p>
<p>Reinhardt says that Charm&#8217;s business began to accelerate last year after his co-founder, chief scientist Shaun Meehan, had a couple of key breakthroughs, and he felt it was time to devote his energies completely to the venture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder Shaun realized that we could convert biomass into a liquid and that that solved a whole bunch of economic logistics issues around how to make biomass accessible,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the second thing was another breakthrough that Shaun had, which was that we could pump that liquid biomass underground and effectively put oil back where it came from. And that idea of pumping liquid plants, basically back underground, to put oil back underground [was key],&#8221; Reinhardt explained.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen biodiesel fuel produced from vegetable oil or cooking grease to run <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/green-cars/biodiesel-car-benefits-buyers-guide-and-fuel-conversion-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specially equipped vehicles</a> for years. Jon Shieber, former TechCrunch reporter, who now works as a venture partner and chief editor at Footprint Coalition, a firm that invests in climate startups, says this is taking the opposite approach. &#8220;It’s biodiesel production, but instead of burning the fuel, they sequester it permanently,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company reports it&#8217;s off to a decent start, removing over 5,400 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2021 using this method, its first full year in operation. It believes that makes it the most successful and largest carbon mitigation project in history, but even with that kind of success, the startup recognizes that it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet… 5,000 tons is a drop in the bucket. We are in a race against time to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year (according to IPCC models). We’ll need multiple methods of carbon removal, all scaling at breakneck speed, to meet our climate goals,&#8221; Reinhardt wrote in the <a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/largest-permanent-carbon-removal-delivery-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company blog</a> in October.</p>
<p>Shieber says that Charm Industrial is in fact part of a group of startups trying to attack this problem. &#8220;All [of these companies are] very promising parts of an emerging chain of carbon capture, sequestration and utilization. Solutions have to do more than just replace fossil fuels. We have to clean up the mess we’ve made in the air,&#8221; Shieber told me.</p>

<p>The company generates revenue by having customers pay them in a form of carbon offsets to cancel out their carbon usage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/">across the supply chain</a>. Stripe was the startup&#8217;s first customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stripe really led the way here with a carbon dioxide removal RFP. And so they became our first customer. They&#8217;ve purchased a couple hundred tons of permanent removal. And they&#8217;ve also gone and purchased from a number of other really interesting new technologies that also do permanent carbon removal,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>Other companies that have bought into this approach with Charm Industrial include Shopify, Zendesk, Block (formerly Square) and Microsoft.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265342-51/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook reports</a> Charm raised over $25 million to date, a number Reinhardt disputed, only confirming that the company has raised an A round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. medical device maker Abbott is moving into making general-purpose consumer biosensing wearables.</p>
<p>The company has been making continuous glucose monitor (CGM) hardware for diabetes management for years (since 2014) &#8212; but in a healthtech keynote at CES yesterday, Abbott&#8217;s chairman and CEO, Robert B. Ford, announced it&#8217;s developing a new line of consumer biowearables &#8212; called Lingo &#8212; intended for more general fitness and wellness purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Technology gives us the power to digitize, decentralize and democratize healthcare, create a shared language between you and your doctor &#8212; and put more control of your health in your hands,&#8221; he said during the keynote. &#8220;We’re creating a future that will bring you and your loved ones care that&#8217;s more personal and precise. It’s happening right now. And its potential is no less than incredible.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ford said the Lingo sensing technology is being designed to track &#8220;key signals&#8221; in the body &#8212; such as glucose, ketones and lactate &#8212; adding that it could also be used to track alcohol levels in the future.</p>
<p>Last year the company launched a biosensor designed for athletes, called the Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biowearable iii &#8212; which was made available in Europe, and has been used by the likes of marathon world-record holder Eliud Kipchoge to support their training needs.</p>
<p><span class="il">Abbott said its goal with Lingo</span> is to expand glucose monitoring to people looking to manage their weight, sleep better, improve energy and think clearer.</p>
<p>To support this expanded utility it said it&#8217;s developing the biosensor to measure other biomarkers than glucose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A ketone biowearable is being developed to track ketones continuously, see how fast you are getting into ketosis, and understand exactly what keeps you there by providing insights on dieting and weight loss,&#8221; the company noted in a press release. &#8220;A lactate biowearable is in development to track continuous lactate build-up during exercise, which can be used as an indicator of athletic performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/signos-series-a/">startups in the U.S.</a>, Europe and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Asia</a> have been seeking to productize CGM hardware &#8212; including existing sensors made by Abbott &#8212; for a variety of non-medical purposes, launching real-time blood glucose tracking services targeted at fitness enthusiasts, peopler wanting to lose weight or generally health conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Abbott jumping into the space itself so quickly suggests it sees significant potential for biosensing consumer wearables to go mainstream.</p>
<p>For a deep dive on what it&#8217;s like living with a CGM biosensor attached to your arm &#8212; and the constantly updating window into biological process that it provides &#8212; check out TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/four-weeks-as-an-ultrahuman-cyborg/">review of Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg service</a>, an Indian-based startup that&#8217;s repurposing current-gen sensing hardware made by Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>An Abbott spokeswoman confirmed the first biowearable to launch will be Lingo Keto &#8212; starting in Europe &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of e-commerce customers prefer to preview a product before making a purchase. That’s the reason why the likes of Amazon have historically struggled to move fashion and home decor items online. A San Francisco and Bengaluru-based startup is attempting to solve this problem and has just raised a new funding round to scale its operations.</p>
<p>AI and computer vision startup <a href="http://Avataar.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avataar</a> said on Friday it has raised $45 million in its Series B funding. The round was led by Tiger Global, and existing investor Sequoia Capital India participated. The six-year-old startup has raised about $55.5 million, including some financed by the founder and chief executive in the early years, across all funding rounds.</p>
<p>Avataar helps direct-to-consumer brands and e-commerce marketplaces with shaping their consumer journeys with 3D rendition of products. Firms can integrate Avataar’s plug-and-play technology into their systems, which then allows customers to visualize products in real-life size and <em>feel</em> in their living room using the phone’s camera.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup currently works with a number of firms, including the top two e-commerce marketplaces across furniture, large appliances and other categories, said Sravanth Aluru, founder and chief executive of Avataar, in an interview with TechCrunch. He declined to share the names of the clients, citing confidentiality agreements. (Some firms such as Samsung and Pepperfry have publicly <a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/get-a-life-like-virtual-shopping-experience-from-your-home-with-augmented-reality-demo-for-samsungs-flagship-refrigerator-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged</a> collaboration with Avataar.)</p>
<p>In a demo, Aluru dragged and dropped several products &#8212; couches and desks &#8212; to his living room from a partner e-commerce marketplace’s app and changed the color and the SKUs without having to reposition the virtual items in the house. The items can also be interactive. A virtual rendition of a refrigerator allows users to open and close the door, for instance.</p>
<p>Brands don’t need to make any major changes to be able to adapt Avataar’s offerings. As long as the product images are in at least 1080p resolution, Aluru said, Avataar can stitch a virtual and 3D version from it. For consumers, too, if they are using an iPhone or an Android smartphone launched in recent years, there’s a good chance that their phone has the computational and graphical power to support viewing and interaction with virtual objects, he said.</p>
<p>“Given the camera is the homescreen, you see significantly higher engagement time and brands are witnessing more than 3.5x sales conversion,” he said. The startup relays the engagement information to the partner brands which then further personalize their offerings to better serve the customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aluru said an increasingly growing number of companies are beginning to adapt the technology as they recognize the benefits it can deliver. This <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/3d-rendering-in-tmall-cutting-edge-tech-to-accelerate-image-preview-30x_596811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend</a> is projected to only grow from here.</p>
<p>Without revealing the brand names, he said some smartphone firms have used Avataar’s technology to carry virtual launches. “We are today integrated across most platforms. If you’re seeing 3D on a big large-volume service, it’s likely powered by us,” he said.</p>

<p>By 2025, nearly 75% of the global population and almost all people who use social and communication apps will be frequent AR users, said Snap in a recent report, for which it collaborated with Deloitte. The report said there are already over 100 million customers who shop using AR.</p>
<p>Aluru said the startup is gearing up to be at the forefront as metaverse makes inroads and engages with several key players in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;The metaverse is already here, just not evenly distributed. Avataar.me is leading the way in bringing scale creation capabilities to the largest brands to enable commerce &#8212; an application with tremendous promise in AR/VR environments,” said Shailesh Lakhani, managing director at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Sravanth, Gaurav, and Mayank have been a delight to work with and Sequoia Capital India is excited to re-iterate its commitment in their Series B round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital and digitally influenced marketplace is projected to grow to $18 trillion by 2025, offering a monetization opportunity of over $50 billion over the next decade for the underlying platforms driving the 2D to 3D commerce shift, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p>“For the first time in history, we are now able to detect, understand, augment and manipulate consumers’ physical reality using a live camera feed. While our patented AI/CV capabilities are applicable to the overall metaverse evolution, we have started with an upfront focus on redefining consumers’ shopping experiences,” said Aluru.</p>
<p>“The platform will transform the consumer shopping experience at home on their mobile devices, through AR glasses/wearables, or even in a physical store exploring an infinite aisle of a digitally enabled catalogue.”</p>
<p>Evan Feinberg, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement: “Consumers continue to look for a better eCommerce experience, and the innovative technology created by Avataar provides a powerful plug and play solution for its customers to meet this demand.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bfree.africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bfree</a>, a Nigerian credit management fintech, has embarked on global expansion after raising $1.7 million in a pre-Series A round, to tap the opportunities in emerging markets, where digital lending apps have recently sprung up in droves.</p>
<p>Funds that participated in the latest round included 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures and several other angel investors, bringing the total capital raised by the Lagos-based startup to $2.5 million, having realized $800,000 in a seed round last May.</p>
<p>Bfree is now on a massive recruitment drive for the 16 new markets in which it is setting up operations, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan and Indonesia. This is as it grows beyond Nigeria, where it started operations in August 2020 before entering Kenya in July last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254904" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are going into markets with large populations, credit deepening and an underdeveloped regulatory environment, where a behavioral collection approach is likely to work,” Bfree co-founder and CEO Julian Flosbach told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bfree was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukwudi-enyi/?originalSubdomain=ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chukwudi Enyi</a> (COO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moses-azubuike-nmor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses Nmor</a> (CPO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-flosbach-461a8756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flosbach</a> (CEO), who were looking to develop better, ethical and tech-inspired debt-collection tools and processes following their firsthand experience working for digital lenders in Nigeria.</p>
<p>“We saw that there was like a little bit of a breach in the value proposition of lenders &#8212; they are good at giving out loans, but the aftersales services of the credit market didn&#8217;t work as collections processes were inefficient and not user friendly,” said Flosbach.</p>
<p>Flosbach told TechCrunch that Bfree employs the use of ethical debt collection standards and works closely with defaulters for tailor-made settlement options, with the end-goal of increasing the repayment rate and customer satisfaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ethical debt collection standards ensure the privacy of customer information during the process, explore flexible repayment options and do not lead to unnecessary penalties like lateness fees and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">debt-shaming</a> (as is the practice with many digital lenders at the moment).</p>

<p>The startup is currently working with 30 credit institutions, including digital lenders, micro-finance institutions and banks. Using customer data provided by the lenders, the startup builds the user profiles of defaulters, and runs their data through an algorithm to predict their behavior and recommend the best collection method.</p>
<p>Depending on a customer’s risk profile, Bfree either directs them to a self-service platform, where borrowers set new payment plans using their phone number, or follows up on debt balance through automated communication (chatbots, callbots or IVR technology) or direct calls. The startup also regularly conducts financial literacy campaigns.</p>
<p>The emerging markets have in recent years experienced a surge in digital lenders providing credit to a population that has remained underserved by formal lenders. The credit offered is often instant and collateral-free, which is unlike loans from formal banking institutions (like banks) where borrowers are at the very least required to hold an account, have regular account activity and maintain minimum operating balances. Besides, traditional lenders require collateral of some kind to cushion them from losses whenever borrowers fail to repay.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Digital lenders avail the much-needed credit to people locked out</a> by formal banking institutions, but they experience a high default rate (in mid 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-06/biden-must-hold-ethiopia-s-abiy-accountable?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenya’s default of digital loans stood at 23%</a>), which has forced them to outsource the services of collection agencies, which, among other techniques, use debt-shaming tactics like calling the friends and relatives of borrowers.</p>
<p>Bfree has so far followed up with 1.1 million defaulters to date, and is currently handling around 800,000 customers, a majority of them in Nigeria. Flosbach anticipates that the startup will be handling 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.</p>
<p>In preparation for its next stage of growth, Bfree has secured the services of leading industry professionals, including CTO Konrad Pawlus, formerly of SALESmanago, and Yohan Theatre, who previously worked at investment management firm PIMCO. Theatre takes over as the head of data decision-making and financial engineering. The duo will be part of the team that will steer the startup’s new business as it works to disrupt traditional finance by leveraging blockchain technology for secondary debt markets.</p>
<p>“Lenders in the U.S. or in Europe have the opportunity to sell significant chunks of their debt portfolios to third parties. This means they only carry a portion of the risk of the loans they issue. In emerging markets, this is typically not the case. Lenders have to carry the entire credit risk on their own. A key driver for this difference lies in higher transaction costs and contractual uncertainties,” said Theatre.</p>
<p>“The arrival of DeFi (decentralized finance) is a game-changer: transaction costs can be slashed while contractual certainty is increased by smart contracts. These are some of the risk-sharing instruments that we are now actively providing to lenders and borrowers,” he said.</p>
