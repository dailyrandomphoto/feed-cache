										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the official start of CES, Samsung today revealed its vision for its next generation of smart TVs that will include everything from cloud-based gaming services to video chat while watching TV to even NFTs. The company says its 2022 Smart TVs will ship with a new &#8220;Smart Hub&#8221; that will offer consumers the ability to switch between different types of entertainment, including media, gaming via its new Gaming Hub, and &#8220;ambient&#8221; &#8212; the latter referring to the TV&#8217;s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/tv-audio-video/what-is-ambient-mode-and-how-to-use-it/">ability</a> to display art, photos, or other information on the TV when it&#8217;s not in use.</p>
<p>For gamers, the most notable addition to the new TVs will be its game streaming discovery platform, the Samsung Gaming Hub, powered by Tizen. This service will allow game streaming providers to bring their game libraries directly to the TV. Samsung today announced partnerships with NVIDIA GeForce NOW, Google&#8217;s Stadia, and Utomik, and says more partnerships will come further down the road.</p>
<p>From the hub, Samsung TV owners will be able to browse available titles, search, and purchase games, and instantly play their favorites. Their game controllers will also be able to be paired with the new Gaming Hub, the company notes. Plus, users can easily access YouTube where they can follow favorite streamers to watch gaming content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Select 2022 4K and 8K TVs and gaming monitors will<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-delivers-premium-hdr-gameplay-with-hdr10plus-gaming-standard-support-for-its-new-screens"> also support</a> the new HDR10+ GAMING standard, offering an HDR gaming experience with low latency, variable refresh rate, and over 120Hz. This experience features automated HDR calibration that does away with the need for manual calibration of settings across input sources, like consoles, PCs and more, the company notes. Supported TVs include the Neo QLED lineup with the Q70 TV series and above, as well as Samsung gaming monitors.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s new Gaming Hub will launch later in 2022 and will be available through the main navigation menu across the Gaming, Media, and Lifestyle categories.</p>

<p>The addition of cloud gaming to smart TVs isn&#8217;t unique to Samsung. LG last year said it was <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/11/lg-to-bring-nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-to-webos-smart-tvs/">bringing</a> GeForce NOW to its WebOS smart TVs, as well as <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-now-on-latest-lg-smart-tvs/">Google Stadia</a>. Amazon&#8217;s Luna <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GPQ58KYZLQTAXEX7">runs on its Fire TVs</a> and Google Stadia works on a range of <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9578631#compatible_tv">supported smart TVs</a>, including those from LG, Hisense, TCL, Philips, and others. And of course, you can also access these services through streaming devices as an alternative.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond gaming, the new line of Samsung&#8217;s 2022 Smart TVs will embrace other trends that grew in popularity over the past year or so, including co-watching TV and movies with friends and buying and selling NFTs.</p>
<p>During the early days of the pandemic, family and friends looked for different ways to connect and spend time together while under Covid-19 lockdowns and other restrictions. This led to a rise in co-watching services and features that let users stream entertainment at the same time as their loved ones. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">Amazon Prime Video</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/disney-plus-groupwatch/">Disney+</a>, among others, launched co-viewing features that let people stream a movie or show at the same time while in different locations. More recently, Apple launched SharePlay over FaceTime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/disney-rolls-out-support-for-apples-shareplay-co-viewing-experience-over-facetime/">which also supports Disney+</a> and other streaming apps, like NBA, Paramount+, Showtime, Apple TV+, and TikTok, for example.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s take on this trend is to instead offer its own, new &#8220;Watch Together&#8221; app that lets family and friends video chat while watching a TV show or movie on their TV.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252530" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252530" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2252530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Another more odd addition to the Smart Hub is support for NFTs. The platform will offer an app that allows users to discover, purchase and trade their NFTs on Samsung&#8217;s MICRO LED, Neo QLED and The Frame TV models later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;With demand for NFTs on the rise, the need for a solution to today&#8217;s fragmented viewing and purchasing landscape has never been greater,&#8221; the company<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858698/samsung-2022-tvs-nft-support-announced-cryptocurrency"> told The Verge, </a>when detailing what it calls the &#8220;world&#8217;s first TV screen-based NFT explorer and marketplace aggregator.&#8221; Users will be able to browse, preview, purchase as well as show off their NFT art on their TVs &#8212; the latter enhanced by a smart calibration feature that will automatically adjust the TV&#8217;s display settings to match the NFT&#8217;s creator&#8217;s recommendations. As users research NFTs, they&#8217;ll also be able to view the NFT&#8217;s history and the blockchain metadata.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252573" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252573" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2252573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung-nft-platform-smart-tv.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252573" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the included services in the new Smart Hub, the 2022 Smart TVs will work with <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-its-2022-micro-led-neo-qled-and-lifestyle-tvs-with-next-generation-picture-quality-and-range-of-cutting-edge-personalization-options">accessories</a> like an Auto Rotating Wall Mount and Stand, which allow users to rotate their screen to a vertical mode. This mode will support Samsung&#8217;s own lifestyle features like its Ambient Mode+ and Art Mode, as well as third-party apps like TikTok and YouTube.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz revealed Monday the Vision EQXX, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like. The upshot? An eye-popping design coupled with advanced engineering that squeezes in power, efficiency and range into a compact and sporty package.</p>
<p>The EQXX is a halo car, which Mercedes said during a digital reveal ahead of the CES tech trade show went from idea to prototype in 18 months. The vehicle is meant be the foundation for its future electric vehicles. The aim wasn&#8217;t just to step up the exterior styling or add in a massive infotainment display — although that is indeed inside the EQXX.</p>
<p>Instead, the company used the EQXX as a proving ground of how far it can push design and engineering. The company focused on improving the energy density of its battery and boosting overall efficiency by reducing the weight of the vehicle using some lightweight materials including for the battery case and brake discs<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, an aerodynamic design that produces a drag coefficient of cd 0.175, ultra low-rolling resistance tires and a new compact electric drivetrain. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252486" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The electric-only chassis features a lightweight F1 subframe and notably the vehicle is outfitted with a 900-volt electric architecture, which Mercedes said proved to be an extremely useful research tool for the development of the power electronics.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252541" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252541" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252541 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX" width="2000" height="1250" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-058.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252541" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX, exterior</p></div></p>
<p>There are other added details too, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ultra-thin roof panels feed the battery system for up to 15.5 miles of extra range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The end result is a vehicle that Mercedes says can travel 620 miles on a single charge and boasts 95% efficiency, which means 95% of the energy from the battery ends up at the wheels. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To develop this futuristic and efficient EV, the company tapped its R&amp;D department as well as people from its Formula 1 and Formula E teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are proving that innovations from motorsport &#8212; where powertrains are already highly electrified &#8212; have immediate relevance for road car development,&#8221; said Markus Schäfer, Daimler AG board member and Mercedes-Benz AG&#8217;s CTO responsible for development and procurement.</p>
<p>Instead of just increasing the size of the battery, Mercedes-Benz and its HPP team developed a new battery pack with an energy density of close to 400 Wh/l.</p>
<p>The company said this benchmark figure is what made it possible to fit a battery pack with just under 100 kWh of usable energy into the compact dimensions of the EQXX.</p>
<p>&#8220;In effect, we fitted the energy of the EQS into the vehicle dimensions of a compact car,&#8221; according to Adam Allsopp, the Advanced Technology Director from HPP, who was referring to the EQS electric vehicle that was introduced in 2021. &#8220;The battery has almost the same amount of energy but is half the size and 30% lighter. The battery management system and power electronics have been designed with an absolute focus on reducing losses. In achieving this efficiency milestone, we learnt a lot that will flow into future development programs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The company was able to increase energy density<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in part from what Mercedes described as &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in the chemistry of the anodes, which has higher silicon content and advanced composition that allowed it to hold considerably more energy than commonly used anodes. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The exterior shows off a sloping front with a gloss-black grille with rose-gold highlights, plus a 2D star pattern on the front bumper. The headlights have two star-shaped elements with the larger one housing the low-beam and high-beam light arrays behind a center lens. Mercedes says this star arrangement and the 2D star pattern on the bumper paired offers a preview of front-end design detailing that will be featured in future models.</p>
<p>Moving to the back end is a surprise: a retractable rear diffuser.</p>

<p>Inside the vehicles is a one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8k resolution. The infotainment screen will have responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes. The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company&#8217;s newer models, the EQXX also feature an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How should we think about the importance of geographic spread — sprawl? — when it comes to on-demand companies?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany&#8217;s Delivery Hero is set to become Glovo&#8217;s majority shareholder following <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/tech-champions-join-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deal to acquire an additional 39.4% stake</a> of the Spanish delivery startup, of which it already held 44%.</p>
<p>We learned of the deal over the holidays, but you&#8217;ll be excused if you missed the news when it broke &#8212; the deal was <a href="https://ir.deliveryhero.com/websites/delivery/English/6150/news-detail.html?newsID=2182241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on December 31 after 11 p.m. CET, much to the <a href="https://twitter.com/m_angelmendez/status/1477073850957504514" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annoyance</a> of Spanish reporters. &#8220;If they have no consideration for their delivery workers, [why would they have any] for the press?&#8221; El Confidencial&#8217;s Michael McLoughlin <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelMCsaez/status/1477047837116583942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ironized</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s not let inside baseball get in the way: The transaction is an interesting piece of news from a number of perspectives. This morning, we&#8217;ll dig into a number of them, including the current pace of on-demand startup consolidation, the power of geographic expansion in the two companies’ market and why Glovo didn’t go public as it once targeted.</p>

Let’s get into it!</p>
<h2>On-demand consolidation</h2>
<p>The key historical context for the Delivery Hero-Glovo deal is DoorDash’s recent agreement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/">to buy food delivery company Wolt for €7 billion</a>, or around $8.1 billion. Wolt is a Finnish company, but with a wide geographic footprint. At the time of the DoorDash deal, TechCrunch wrote that Wolt “has over 4,000 employees across 23 countries.”</p>
<p>Glovo is also active in a host of markets, a feat that it notably achieved at least in part thanks to acquisitions. The company bought brands from, of all companies, Delivery Hero in 2021, when the Spanish company <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/spains-glovo-goes-on-a-shopping-spree-snaps-up-three-of-berlin-based-delivery-heros-brands-foodpanda-donesi-and-pauza-for-e170-million-picks-up-slovenias-ehrana-for-des/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired brands from its new parent company for €170 million</a>. But that was not the end of Glovo’s 2021 deal spree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The long, lonesome death of the classic BlackBerry brand <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/support/devices/end-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hits another milestone tomorrow</a>, as the company finally will end access to legacy services. Users still hanging onto devices running BlackBerry OS 7.1 and BlackBerry 10 will lose substantial functionality on Tuesday, January 4. The list includes &#8212; but is not limited to &#8212; key features like data, phone calls, SMS and 911 access. So, you know, the stuff you do with a phone.</p>
<p>As the company notes, this move is a long time coming. BlackBerry ditched its in-house hardware way back in 2016, farming out the brand to companies like TCL (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/blackberry-and-tcl-will-end-their-handset-partnership-in-august-2020/">called it quits in 2020)</a>. The company announced the January 4 shutdown all the way back in 2020, so, you can’t accuse BlackBerry of not offering significant transition time. The statement notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As another milestone in the BlackBerry journey, we will be taking steps to decommission the legacy services for BlackBerry 7.1 OS and earlier, BlackBerry 10 software, BlackBerry PlayBook OS 2.1 and earlier versions, with an end of life or termination date of January 4, 2022. As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality. We have chosen to extend our service until then as an expression of thanks to our loyal partners and customers.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252492" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of options out there &#8212; though<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/blackberrys-brand-switches-hands-again-set-to-return-as-a-5g-android-handset/"> OnwardMobility</a>, which promised a 5G BlackBerry-branded device, is currently still MIA, in spite of promising an announcement in 2021. There’s always the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/after-essentials-failure-osom-plans-a-new-privacy-first-handset/">OSOM device</a>, which sports its own Canadian pedigree. Though, again, that privacy-focused product won’t be announced until Mobile World Congress at the end of next month.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let’s have a moment to remember the days when the BlackBerry ruled the mobile roost, as the choice of world leaders, entertainment figures and normal folks, alike. In the world of hardware, however, nothing gold can stay &#8212; physical keyboards included. RIP BB classic. It&#8217;s been real.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Twitter announced today it has completed the sale of its mobile ad platform, MoPub, to the mobile game maker and marketing software provider AppLovin for $1.05 billion in cash. The deal was first announced in October 2021, following Twitter&#8217;s reveal of its plan to double its revenue by 2023 to reach $7.5 billion or more. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced today it has completed the sale of its mobile ad platform, MoPub, to the mobile game maker and marketing software provider AppLovin for $1.05 billion in cash. The deal was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/twitter-mopub-applovin-deal/">announced</a> in October 2021, following Twitter&#8217;s reveal of its plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">double its revenue</a> by 2023 to reach $7.5 billion or more. While MoPub had helped Twitter generate approximately $188 million in annual revenue in 2020, Twitter now sees more potential in developing other areas of its business amid its accelerated product development. Specifically, the company said it&#8217;s now redirecting its resources toward performance-based ads, SMB and commerce.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter reiterated its plans to further the development of its own owned and operated products.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the sale of MoPub completed, we continue to concentrate our efforts on enhancing ads across our platform. Our goal is to deliver faster growth in key areas and accelerate our product development,&#8221; said Bruce Falck, Twitter&#8217;s GM of Revenue Products, in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-completes-sale-of-mopub-301452516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a press release</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Previously, Twitter CFO Ned Segal had <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-sell-mopub-to-applovin-for-1-05-billion-in-cash-301394571.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> how MoPub&#8217;s sale allowed Twitter to concentrate on the &#8220;massive potential for ads&#8221; on its website and mobile apps.</p>
<p>But the deal also represents an opportunity for Twitter to invest in new areas of its business that could allow it to expand its revenue model beyond advertising alone. The company, over the past year or so, has significantly accelerated the pace of product development with launches like its audio chat rooms called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Twitter Spaces</a>, newsletters (via its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> acquisition), online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">communities</a>, a misinformation debunking project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">Birdwatch</a>, paid subscription service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">creator economy tools</a> and features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Super Follow</a> and tipping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">crypto</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"> e-commerce</a> including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform/">live shopping</a>, and more. Combined, these products leave Twitter more opportunities to seek out revenue in new ways &#8212; like commissions on ticketed events or subscriptions, for example.</p>
<p>The sale of MoPub also came at a time when the mobile ad industry had been upset by changes implemented by Apple in its latest version of the iOS mobile operating system. With Apple&#8217;s new privacy-focused tools, more consumers can now opt out of being tracked by apps and advertisers, making a business like MoPub much less interesting for Twitter. AppLovin, however, <a href="https://www.applovin.com/blog/mopub-transaction-slated-to-close-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sees the opportunity</a> in leveraging MoPub&#8217;s demand- and supply-side tools into its larger in-app mediation platform, MAX, then migrate publishers and demand partners to the unified platform, further growing its business. The company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220103005089/en/AppLovin-Closes-Acquisition-of-Twitter%E2%80%99s-MoPub-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says it expects</a> to process more than $15 billion of annualized advertiser spend by 2023.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://investors.applovin.com/news/news-details/2021/AppLovin-to-Acquire-Twitters-MoPub-Business/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time of the deal,</a> MoPub&#8217;s software was used by 45,000 mobile apps to manage their monetization and reached 1.5 billion addressable users around the world, AppLovin said. Today, more than 150 DSPs, representing thousands of brands and agencies, now have direct access to the AppLovin Exchange, the company adds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Developers benefit from more features to help drive higher monetization opportunities and streamline workflows, leading to increased revenue for their businesses. We believe the power of this unified platform will be unparalleled in today’s market,&#8221; said Adam Foroughi, AppLovin’s co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to execute on this strategic acquisition with our sights set on operating the largest and most robust in-app advertising platform that enhances the growth of the broader mobile app ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition had been expected to close in early 2022.</p>
<p>Twitter today noted that the MoPub platform, including network mediation, Advanced Bidding and Marketplace, will be sunset on March 31, 2022. The MoPub Dashboard and Reporting will be available until April 8, 2022. Publishers will have a 90-day transition period from close to <a href="https://www.applovin.com/mopub-max-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migrate</a> off the MoPub platform to AppLovin&#8217;s MAX platform.</p>

Before college, he had also co-founded a game studio called Sinextra that he says “had some huge Brazilian customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal with Abstra is simple: to help people make apps without coding. It is, in particular, good for agencies who want to deliver faster results or for non-technical departments that need to iterate faster but depend on centralized engineering teams to implement everything, according to Costa. With Abstra,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designers and junior programmers can build professional websites and apps “much faster than senior developers in bigger companies,” Costa said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We allow easy-to-use customization without the UI limitations that no-code tools commonly have,” he added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no-code is supposed to already be easy, Costa believes that some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no-code tools struggle to serve designers because they need a lot of fine tuning while having no coding skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some are too technical while others are just assembling pre-built interfaces,” he said. “We are developing a mechanism that tackles both problems in that it is easy to use and flexible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra is focused on late-/growth-stage tech companies and enterprise IT consulting companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the startup is growing MRR (monthly recurring revenue) 45% on average and has landed 11 customers, including Accenture, Stone and Descomplica. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s spring 2021 batch before catching SoftBank’s eye. Iporanga, Alexia Ventures and some angels have also put money in the company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic, every business has had “to go somewhat digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This exploded the demand for software production,” Costa told TechCrunch. “But there are just not enough developers available. So no-code was hugely beneficial with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young startup got the opportunity to pitch Accenture, a consulting firm that had over $50 billion in revenue in 2021, because Costa had a friend in common with some people who worked there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I showed our results from previous clients and a product demo and they decided to run a pilot at  that same meeting,” Costa told TechCrunch. “They are now one of our most active users. As an enterprise consulting firm, using tools like ours makes them much more competitive.”</span></p>
<p>Alexia Ventures&#8217; Patrick Arippol told TechCrunch that his firm believes that the &#8220;no and low code opportunity set is in its early days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstra’s initial product showed much promise and potential at a global level, based on early customer feedback and on the product’s architecture and underlying premises,&#8221; he wrote via email.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use the new capital primarily toward beefing up its current nine-person staff, particularly across its engineering, marketing, sales and operations teams.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the new year! Yes, welcome to 2022 from the Equity team. We hope that our holiday episodes kept you entertained, and warm. But it&#8217;s now back to work, so let&#8217;s get into the news:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Global stocks are generally higher today, while cryptos are mostly flat. In the last week, major cryptocurrencies have lost value.</li>
<li>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/02/twitter-bans-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-personal-account-over-covid-19-misinformation/">banned Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene</a> for &#8220;repeated violations of [its] COVID-19 misinformation policy.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is taking a much-deserved holiday out in nature, so I&#8217;ll be taking over this week to give you the news and wish you both a Happy New Year and a swift hangover recovery.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s officially 2022, but let&#8217;s take a quick look over the past year. To quickly sum up &#8212; everyone bought e-bikes; robotaxis and autonomous trucks are getting closer to commercialization; teleoperated sidewalk delivery robots are becoming a thing; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Association is keeping an eye on the likes of Tesla and Chevy; pretty much every OEM is investing serious cash into electrifying, and that includes battery joint ventures; and eVTOLs got a huge amount of investment.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig a bit deeper into that last. My colleague Aria Alamalhodaei wrote a two-part series on the trends shaping the eVTOL space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/top-evtol-trends-2021/">The first part looked back at 2021</a>, highlighting such trends as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPACs have been taking off and helping fuel a stupid amount of money into the industry, with companies like <strong>Archer Aviation</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>, <strong>Lilium</strong> and <strong>Vertical Aerospace </strong>all merging with blank check companies.</li>
<li>On-the-ground infrastructure, like vertiports and chargers, is turning into its own business unit, and companies like <strong>Archer</strong>, <strong>Hyundai </strong>and <strong>Volocopter</strong> are exploring ways to integrate air mobility into a city&#8217;s existing transport networks.</li>
<li>There have been increased orders for eVTOL aircraft, starting with <strong>United Airline&#8217;s</strong> $1 billion order with Archer.</li>
<li>Automakers &#8212; like Hyundai, <strong>Honda</strong> and <strong>Xpeng</strong> &#8212; are investing resources into building their own flying cars.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this movement is setting the stage for what&#8217;s to come in 2022. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/the-evtol-take-off-part-two-looking-ahead-to-2022/">Some of Aria&#8217;s predictions are</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The main story of 2022, it’s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</li>
<li>More automakers will start getting involved in the space. That much is clear from major investments from <strong>Toyota</strong> and <strong>Stellantis</strong> into <strong>Joby</strong> and a manufacturing deal with <strong>Archer</strong>, respectively.</li>
<li>More SPAC deals. Aria writes that it&#8217;s not a given, &#8220;but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re making predictions, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t share some thoughts about what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/micromobility-in-2022-refined-mature-and-packed-full-of-tech/">2022 may hold for the world of micromobility</a>. I spoke to a few experts and came up with some interesting, and even wacky, responses.</p>
<p>Crystal ball says&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>More e-bikes will hit the shared micromobility space.</li>
<li>Fresh VC money is drying up and there aren&#8217;t likely to be more new entrants into the space. Those who have made it this far are likely here to stay, and they&#8217;re becoming more mature and more efficient.</li>
<li>That said, the ride-hail companies (aka <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong>) might be coming back to play, says <strong>Segway&#8217;s</strong> Tony Ho, based on orders and inquiries for vehicles he&#8217;s seeing come in.</li>
<li>All that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter ADAS</a> we started to see last year? Yeah, it&#8217;s here to stay, and will only increase. But that&#8217;s not all! Buckle up for smarter vehicles that will not only affect the way you ride, but will also provide operators with more monetization opportunities. Data. Is. Everything. Operators will be looking for ways to sell sensor data.</li>
<li>Horace Dediu, industry analyst and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast, reckons there&#8217;ll be far more integration of micromobiilty options with transit planning apps like Google Maps.</li>
<li>He also said we can expect a marriage between micromobility and the metaverse. The f&amp;%!, you might be thinking. Wait for it. Imagine a smart helmet with an augmented reality-enabled visor, pointing out directions for you or enticing you into the nearest coffee shop with a floating coupon!</li>
<li>New, heavier, form factors. Personally, I wanna see a tiny vehicle with a roof, already! We don&#8217;t all love getting caught in the rain.</li>
<li>Better integration of micromobility offerings with public transit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In other news&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voi </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/2250109/">just raised a $115 million Series D</a> in what it describes as an oversubscribed funding round that will help it expand into new markets. As scooter companies consolidate their power, such a big raise this late in the game is definitely significant.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Mobility</strong>, which has sold off Italian and Israeli operations in recent months, is now upgrading its e-scooter fleet in Nottingham and Derby in the U.K. with LINK e-scooters from <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>. Users will now need to download the LINK app to continue using Wind&#8217;s service&#8230; so is it really Wind&#8217;s service anymore?</p>
<p>Superpedestrian also launched 150 seated scooters in Baltimore to provide a safer and more comfortable transportation option to people with disabilities and older riders.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What with the holidays, there haven&#8217;t been too many deals, but I did notice AI chip maker <strong>Kneron&#8217;s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ai-chip-kneron-25-million-funding/">$25 million raise</a>. The Chinese startup will use the funding to start making chips for autonomous driving applications. This move comes as the company possibly prepares to go public in the U.S. in the next few years, and with an increased number of AV companies aiming to scale over the same time frame, Kneron might be one to watch.</p>
<p>The other deal that caught my eye is South Africa&#8217;s <strong>Planet42</strong>, a car subscription company that buys used cars from dealerships and rents to customers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/south-africas-planet42-gets-30m-for-its-car-subscription-service-mexico-expansion/">just raised $30 million in equity and debt.</a> The round is a bridge round, a precursor to a Series A, and it will help the company expand into the Mexican market.</p>
<p>Planet42 has an interesting business model that it calls &#8220;socially inclusive.&#8221; As a company that provides services in emerging markets, it helps people who perhaps have unstable incomes or unimpressive credit scores access vehicles that could potentially change their lives.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Waymo</strong> is partnering with Chinese automaker <strong>Geely</strong> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/">build an all-electric, self-driving ride-hailing vehicle</a>. The companies will integrate Waymo Driver, Waymo’s AV system, into Geely’s <strong>Zeekr</strong> vehicles for use in U.S. markets “in the years to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>TuSimple</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/">completed its first autonomous truck run on open public roads without a human in the vehicle</a> or any human intervention. Its autonomous driving system fully navigated an 80-mile run along surface streets and highways between Tuscon, Arizona and Phoenix, marking a milestone for the company that aims to scale its technology into purpose-built trucks by 2024, says president and CEO Cheng Lu.</span></p>
<p><strong>Iveco</strong> joined <strong>Plus</strong> to launch a pilot in Europe and China that aims to start validating and integrating Plus&#8217;s autonomous trucking technology with Iveco&#8217;s latest gen S-Way heavy-duty truck.</p>
<p><strong>AutoX </strong>built a Level 4 robotaxi production facility in China to manufacture its gen 5 vehicles, which it says can operate without safety drivers in the vehicle.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FedEx</strong> has received its first five <strong>GM</strong>-built <strong>Brightdrop </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fedex-receives-its-first-fully-electric-gm-brightdrop-delivery-vans/">electric delivery vans out of an order of 500</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizing information from providers, insurers and patients not only takes a lot of time, but increases private healthcare costs. <a href="https://www.smarterhealth.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smarter Health</a>, a Singaporean-based startup, develops technology that allows smoother exchange of data between different parties in the healthcare system, improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The company announced today it has raised a $5.15 million SGD (about $3.8 million USD) Series A led by East Ventures for product development and to expand in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Other investors included Orbit Malaysia, Citrine Capital, HMI Group and Emtek.</p>
<p>The company currently operates in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and plans to enter into new countries with its new funding. The new round brings Smarter Health’s total raised to $8 million SGD.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smarter Health’s platform isn’t meant to replace legacy software already in use by its clients. Instead, it seeks to work with them, and reduce manual processes. The startup’s AI-based tech enables secure data exchanges (with patient consent) between healthcare providers, insurers and patients. This enables it to offer a roster of services. For payors and insurers, this includes a patient concierge that recommends specialists, schedules appointments and creates demographic profiles of policy holders. It also automates claims assessments, updates insurers about cases and makes the bill and claims adjudication process faster.</p>
<p>The company has three main customer categories: doctors, hospitals and insurers and other corporate payors, like AIA, Allianz and Prudential, which make up the bulk of its business.</p>
<p>For healthcare organizations and providers, Smarter Health offers specialist recommendations and patient registration tools, a load-levelling solution that shortens waiting times and digitized hospital admissions and claim submissions.</p>
<p>In a statement, East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has forced insurers and healthcare providers to reflect and re-strategize on their operations, catalyzing digital transformation. Smarter Health is here to make healthcare accessible, affordable and accountable by providing an AI-powered interoperable platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few years, Dell (and its gaming brand, Alienware) has grown fond of showing off concept devices &#8212; as a potential look at what may be coming down the road. In fact, it’s a growing trend in the consumer electronics industry at large, taking a page out of the automotive world’s book. Depending on how you look at it, it’s either an intriguing glimpse into a potential future or a bit of a red herring.</p>
<p>For Dell, it’s an opportunity to gauge community interest for a technology that’s not quite ready for prime time. The best known recent example is Concept UFO, a handheld gaming console Alienware showed off this time last year, which, to date, is still very much a concept.</p>

<p>Concept Nyx joins the product this year, essentially operating as an at-home server that can stream games throughout the home. The ultimate idea behind the product lets houses stream multiple games to multiple devices at once, regardless of the hardware they’re playing on. The controller, meanwhile, serves as the primary contact, connecting to a smart TV, computer or other device and playing the game through a Dell app.</p>
<p>There are likely some kinks to work out, including pricing and the sort of compute power necessary to stream multiple games at once. Adding a bunch of CPUs and GPUs onto a product adds up pretty fast, though none of this sounds too far outside of the realm of possibility for streaming over home Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>I think the bigger question at hand is how much demand there is for a thing. I suspect a large portion of its potential audience have already invested in gaming PCs or consoles. And even if they haven’t, such a product would have to be competitively priced &#8212; certainly the promise of streaming two (or even four) games at once in a house isn’t worth a product that costs the same as two consoles for most scenarios.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250150" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250150" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="694" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg 2558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=1536,1041 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=2048,1387 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Concept-UFO-controller-CAPTION-Devices-shown-are-concept-designs-and-not-available-for-p.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alienware</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company writes in a blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been looking at how to power four game streams simultaneously, smart switching among devices, and drawing from a central library of all your games regardless of where you purchase them. Gaming on Concept Nyx aims to be as effortless as accessing your favorite music, TV shows and movies. Imagine a simple app loaded on each device delivering instant access to all your games for a more seamless gaming experience across devices in the home. Imagine no more fighting with your family or roommates over game time (you can still fight over groceries and laundry). Wouldn’t it be nice to tear down the barricades so that everyone can game on their own terms?</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is firmly in the concept phase, but in its current iteration, Nyx sounds likely to be nixed before hitting the market.</p>

<p>This argument over Web3 is really exciting. How does one call out either of the two main protagonists? Jack Dorsey has an unlimited hall pass now that he&#8217;s free of Wall Street&#8217;s hound dogging adult supervision of Twitter, and he&#8217;s using it for some subtle purpose. I don&#8217;t know the guy well, but I&#8217;ve always appreciated his counter-conventional attitude toward great truths he has no time for. Marc Andreessen I don&#8217;t know so well either, but I&#8217;m desperate not to be blocked by him. I listened to a Kara Swisher Twitter Space today, where she has already been blocked for some reason. She&#8217;s becoming my favorite media personality for asking all the questions I might have in a format (live audio) where I will never be invited on stage. As a consequence I find her spaces to be a fantastic validation of the new format because when she&#8217;s there, the distinctions between host and speaker and listener are irrelevant.</p>
<p>As Doc Searls reminds me, people in our age bracket are dropping like flies. A few weeks ago we talked about Kim Cameron of the Identity Gang; this week it&#8217;s Chris Locke, of Cluetrain fame. We recorded on Clubhouse and the link is in the newsletter below. As you&#8217;ll hear, he was nicknamed Rageboy for all the right reasons, an original voice who came along as the Internet gave voice to anyone who showed up. According to Doc, he pretty much invented Cluetrain on the wings of the previous generation of rageboys, with names like Vonnegut and most definitional Hunter S. Thompson. Like John Lennon, who brought Paul in, and Paul, who brought George in, and George, who brought Ringo in, Locke connected Doc, David Weinberger, and a technologist, Rick Levine, who built the website that morphed into the business book. The last add reminds me of the guy in Monty Python who did all the surreal animations that connected the tissues of the group together.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Markets are conversations, Doc and the Cluetrain said, and at the time many felt they understood the fundamental note, what Doc now calls the promise of independence. Today&#8217;s conversation about Web3 feels important and epoch-changing, but the last years of Trumpism and the pandemic leave us more cautious about the impact of technology. My semi-literate guess is that both Jack and Marc represent a conversation that depends on both being right, yet the media wants an argument and an afterparty rope line. I don&#8217;t hear agreement so much as the John and Paul dialogue: Getting better all the time, Can&#8217;t get much worse.</p>
<p>As the warriors of the early Internet begin to pass from the scene, I remember the flush of optimism of that earlier time. The battles were over things like owning our own data, being able to transport it from platform to platform, and forging the social media moment into something we could run with in the broader media world. The influencer role was an outgrowth of that surge, the endorsement model its economic driver. It always felt akin to a record deal in the 70’s and 80’s; you pulled enough of a base to fund a recording session, then shopped it to a label. Success was radio airplay, and the hope of a contract for more recording and support for touring.</p>
<p>At its inception, podcasting offered a bootstrap past the record companies and their marketing departments to a more elastic audience development environment. You no longer needed access to the radio funnel with its strictures of expensive recoupable recording time, loss leader showcase performances, and a scratch-my-back, I’ll-scratch-yours quid pro quo insider angle. All those things were still there, but the scale was compressed.</p>
<p>Recordings could be assembled with low-cost prosumer equipment, synthesizers and MIDI bridged the gap between home and studio settings, and sometimes hit records emerged that used a hybrid between the two domains. The Stones in particular worked up riffs on cassettes and moved the actual tracks over to multitracks for sweetening. On the other end of the pipeline, Stevie Wonder used the same overdubbing and multi-track building of home recording to take complete control of the studio as he went from the Motown music factory to music he wrote, played most if not all of the instruments, and partnered with engineers and technologists to spawn a generation of tools that worked fairly transparently across the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s smart phones, cloud services, and app stores provide much the same transfer of power from the labels to the creators. Newletters and live audio networks make it possible to write, record, and distribute material at little or no additional expense. You can effectively create an audience one post at a time, using social media to promote and engage with a growing network of hosts, speakers, and listeners that float between roles in a social and aspirational way. On Clubhouse, record/replay tools produce what are reminiscent of Top Ten lists of most popular replays. Next up will be most popular with certain groups and mining of metadata about how the members of those groups behave with related shows and artists. This evolution of what used to be called liner notes until the CD format and streaming crushed it drove the market from Top Forty radio to deep cut album-oriented FM, and from there to Netflix analytics that determine renewals based on shows’ impact on retention of valuable subscribers.</p>
<p>As I read this, word choice feels forced and arbitrary. I’m failing at communicating why I like this new platform. Perhaps it’s the excessive noise about the creator economy. Is it an economy when the money to be made is at best an after thought to attracting the same media system ostensibly being reformed? Perhaps it’s the melancholy feeling of viewing the present through the prism of the fading past. I can’t remember the details of that earlier time, just the energy that seemed to pulse out of the electric realtime global moment. A live streaming show captures some of that, but not the shared excitement of the possibilities of the era. I got a glimpse of it the first time I launched a Clubhouse room; the random architecture of the notification and follow system drew a very few people, but more than enough to see how this will supersede full production podcasting as it absorbs it.</p>
<p>As with a similar Twitter Space conversation, you could watch listeners drop in, leave, and over time drop back in. My assumption is that the discussion was marginally more interesting or potentially so than other long tail alternatives. Backing the recording up is a 24 hour-plus crapshoot to enable transcription services, so Clubhouse wins for the moment. And the history of the early days of Twitter v. Facebook shows most early adopters will join both to drive improvements in production automation and analytics extraction. This is not the economy at work but more the environment of early film schools like NYU and USC that spawned a community of directors and producers like Lucas, Coppola, and Scorsese that dominated the New Wave of Hollywood filmmaking.</p>
<p>It’s a fragile thing, market-forming, and not at all clear the commitment of these players to anything other than a winner-take-all strategy. Even though the viral attractions of Twitter are seductive, its past history of bailing on third-party developers and acquisitions like Vine and Periscope helps keep Clubhouse in the game as Twitter wrestles with a post-Dorsey resource battle at the parent company. And it’s not just a Field of Dreams story. Sure, if they build it, they will come. But that’s not what “they” will stay for.</p>
<p>Take the cable networks. Please. How much longer will we stare openmouthed at the dismantling of democracy. Or the war with the virus. We long for answers, not growth opportunities. I read a review of the new Don’t Look Up asteroid movie that described it as good but not great. It’s often characterized as a climate change allegory, but for me it was only about Trump winning reelection. Half the country wouldn’t believe the asteroid was coming until they could see it in the nightime sky, but what really hurt was how many didn’t believe it when they could see it.</p>
<p>The review was on Medium, another Field of Dreams startup. Another post concerned the trope that we’re seeing Omicron turn the pandemic into the common cold. Wishful thinking, but not backed up with the data, which the author says suggests the result could be milder or just as possible more severe. Not comforting, but ever more consequential if we act on the science not our hopes. Technology serves us when we follow the data and take sides. The story of the Beatles is not why they broke up but rather how they got together for so long in the first place.</p>

Data labeling is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a critical part of automating artificial intelligence and machine learning models, but at the same time, it can be time-consuming and tedious work.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Korean startup called <a href="https://en.aimmo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIMMO</a>, which uses software and humans to label and categorize image, video, sound, text and sensor fusion data, built an AI data annotation platform, making the data labeling faster for enterprises. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AIMMO announced today it has raised $12 million in a Series A round to advance its data labeling technology and spur global expansion. Seven venture capital firms participated in the latest round: DS Asset Management, Industrial Bank of Korea, Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">S&amp;S Investment, Toss Investment, Korea Asset Investment &amp; Securities </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and Venture Field. AIMMO declined to comment on its valuation.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252386" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The pandemic accelerated transforming contactless technology with AI deployment for intelligence surveillance, smart city, autonomous driving, smart factory and robotics where AI data is inevitably needed,” Doyle Chung, head of Global Sales of AIMMO, said in an email interview. “Among all the directions and industries, our focuses are [mainly] smart city and autonomous driving.” </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by chief executive officer SeungTaek Oh, the startup has three data annotation tools: AIMMO DaaS, which manages sensor fusion data for autonomous vehicle corporations; AIMMO GtaaS, a turnkey-based platform for big data; and AIMMO Enterprises, launched in 2020, a web-based SaaS annotation labeling tool using cloud architecture.</p>
<p>The startup said its tools help improve the inefficiency of the data annotation process so that customers focus only on their AI modeling. There’s no platform fee, coding skills or installation required for AIMMO Enterprises, with which users can label their data via browsers like Chrome. As for its AIMMO GtaaS, users send raw data to AIMMO that labels the data with inspection and delivers it back to the customers, Chung said.</p>
<p>Through the AIMMO DaaS platform, its sales and volume of its data labeling increased by 200% in 2021 compared to the previous year. AIMMO posted $10 million of revenue in 2021, according to its IR pitch deck. The company expects growth in 2022, with the global demand for the autonomous driving field continually increasing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The global data collection and labeling market size was valued at $1.6 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $8.2 billion in 2028, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-collection-labeling-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a market analysis report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Grand View Research. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AIMMO works with an array of companies, including carmaker <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyundai Motor</a>, car parts developer <a href="https://en.mobis.co.kr/main/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyundai Mobis</a></span>, car-hailing startup<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Kakao Mobility, car-sharing startup SoCar </span>and autonomous cargo developer <a href="https://www.thordrive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoreDrive</a>.

<p>The Korea-headquartered startup has offices in the U.K, the U.S., Japan and Vietnam. Chung said it also plans to open offices in Germany and Canada in 2022. AIMMO will compete with companies like Scale AI, Playment, Understand.ai and Deepen AI when it expands further to the global market. Today, the startup has 200 employees across the globe and more than 10,000 data labelers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has permanently suspended the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) &#8220;for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,&#8221; according to the company. Her official government account remains active.</p>
<p>Rep. Greene has been prolific in the posting of articles and statistics supposedly pertaining to the pandemic but often are misleading or flat-out wrong. This is one of the topics on which Twitter has drawn a line in the sand, as misinformation on the virus, how it spreads, the efficacy of the vaccines, etc has a serious effect on public health.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy">Twitter&#8217;s COVID-19 policy is outlined here</a>; in a statement, the company said &#8220;We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The permanent ban comes after several shorter account locks and warnings, which occurred and were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-mjt-twitter-suspension/">reported on throughout 2021</a>. Greene complained then of violations of her &#8220;freedom of speech,&#8221; despite Twitter being a privately owned and operated platform with clearly stated rules, and made a final complaint in a statement this morning: &#8220;Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth. That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this statement means that she will discontinue her own use of this &#8220;enemy&#8221; platform she claims not to need. Her official U.S. Representative account remains online, though it has not been used in a week. I&#8217;ve asked Twitter whether this account too has been put in jeopardy by her violations, and will update this post if I hear back.</p>
<p>Twitter regularly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">issues bans to fringe figures</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/twitter-bans-james-okeefe-of-project-veritas-over-fake-account-policy/">who have violated rules</a> on inciting violence, publishing false or private information, or spreading false information regarding the pandemic.</p>
<p>This story is developing, check back later for updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The biggest and most eye-wateringly silly rebrand of the year is uncontested: Facebook, one of the most recognizable names in the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">changed its name to Meta</a> in order to <del>distract from unflaggingly awful decisions and the irreparable harm it has caused countless people</del> focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">the &#8220;metaverse,&#8221;</a> something no one asked for and certainly no one wanted Facebook of all companies to take the lead on.</p>
<h3>Block this out</h3>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Meta’s not the only rebrand that went teeth-grindingly meta this year. Readers, we present… <a href="https://www.block.xyz">Block</a>, FKA Square, originally a small business champion known for square-shaped card swiping dongles (quant!). Now, it’s taking a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">bite out of blockchain</a> for its new name and identity, although apparently Block is not just about that. The company says it’s also a reference to block parties, building code, obstacles to overcome, “and of course, tungsten cubes.” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/cryptocurrency-enthusiasts-are-obsessed-dense-tungsten-cubes-rcna4283">click for more cringe</a>) Well, not so fast, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201006139/en/Square-Inc.-Changes-Name-to-Block">Jack</a>! H&amp;R Block is already <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/16/2353519/0/en/H-R-Block-Files-Trademark-Infringement-Lawsuit-Against-Block-Inc-formerly-Square-Inc.html">suing Block</a> for trademark infringement, with the name, a block in its logo, and a green color scheme that all come a little too close to home, since H&amp;R Block, best known for tax filing prep, also happens to sell accounting services to SMBs, mobile banking to consumers and other fintech services just like Square’s… I mean, Block’s. Hard to guess which blockhead will back down first/move to settle here.</p>

<p>Mr. Musk perhaps said it best when he played a doctor in the Gen Z Hospital skit: “You all might want to sit down, what I have to say might be a little cringe.” Elon may have hoodwinked a substantial part of the population of global fanboys hoping to get rich on his coattails, but at the end of the day this couldn’t hold any water on Saturday Night Live. He’s not an actor, and he’s not that funny, so even with the wattage of being one of the world’s richest men and a major celeb on social media, his SNL hosting was… a smug, wooden, boring, awkward dud. You’re left wondering how/why he was anointed to be in the limelight in the first place (but then again, I wonder that about him most of the time).</p>

<p>The gold rush over NFTs caused some otherwise smart people to attempt to implement them in regrettable ways. Numerous companies announced NFT-adjacent projects, like using them to tokenize fanfic, in-game items, Discord things(?), and so on. After failing to read the internet in general’s skepticism of this interesting but at present highly dubious tech, the companies backpedaled madly, sometimes within hours of announcements or rumors. Literally anyone would have said it was a bad idea, try asking next time!</p>
<h3>Bezos thanks everyone for their money, which he shot into space</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2180039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180039" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos_space.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180039" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joe Raedle / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The relentless self-congratulatory fanfare around Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first &#8220;real&#8221; trips to space was extremely tiring. While there was some relief in Branson&#8217;s company getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/virgin-galactic-is-clear-to-fly-again-following-faas-mishap-investigation-of-branson-flight/">grounded for shady maneuvers</a>, and in Bezos eliciting scorn for his tamales and his giant hat, the chef&#8217;s-kiss moment was the latter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/bezos-and-crew-host-a-giddy-press-conference-after-blue-origins-inaugural-crewed-launch/">tone-deaf thanks</a> offered to the world that financed his ego trip by shopping at his ethically bankrupt mega-corporation. &#8220;I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure he meant every word, which is why it&#8217;s so bad. (Also pity the poor cowboy hat, which Bezos has definitely also ruined for me.)</p>
<h3>Blue Origin whining postpones the next Moon landing</h3>
<p>After losing big time on the Human Landing System contract to arch-rival SpaceX, Blue Origin sued NASA, alleging impropriety. Its claims were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">dismissed in a highly embarrassing manner</a> (NASA basically pantsed the company in front of the entire industry) but the necessary rigmarole resulted in the planned 2024 crewed lunar landing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">being pushed out to 2025</a>. To be fair, we all suspected this would be the case anyway, but Blue presented itself as a perfect scapegoat. The blunder may have permanently tainted relations with NASA, which isn’t great when they’re pretty much Blue Origin’s only source of real money… other than “every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer,” of course.</p>
<h3>OnlyFans bans itself</h3>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ukHvXhN1UD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans bans explicit content</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We all know what OnlyFans is for, and it&#8217;s been great seeing a platform where sex workers, among others, can monetize themselves. Until that platform abruptly announced that the people who&#8217;d made it rich in the first place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">were henceforth banned</a>. Bye, good luck! The backlash was so severe that the decision, unconvincingly blamed on prudish bankers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">was reversed within a week</a>. Don&#8217;t bite the hand that feeds you, people. (Unless the hand consents as part of a healthy fantasy.)</p>
<h3>From the desk of Donald J. Trump</h3>
<p>Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">tempestuous relationship with social media</a> is perhaps too serious a matter to treat of here, but one aspect of it deserves a palm to the face, and that&#8217;s his short-lived &#8220;social&#8221; platform, From The Desk of Donald J. Trump. This barebones microblog appeared after his ouster from every major social media network, but it was so minimally functional and got so little traffic that it only lasted a month or so before being mothballed. No doubt so his media team could focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">borrowing Mastodon&#8217;s code</a> for the follow-up, Truth Social. But even <i>that</i> was all just preliminary to the desperate-looking pitch deck and SPAC we would receive later in the year. As they say, if at first you fail badly, fail, fail again.</p>
<h3>Senator Blumenthal asks Facebook rep to “commit to ending finsta”</h3>
<p>Now known as the Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen leaked thousands of internal documents from her former employer, including some showing that Instagram is aware of its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">adverse effect</a> on teenage girls. Soon after, Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis was summoned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">testify before the Senate</a> about children’s internet safety.</p>
<p>Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a 75-year-old, was worried about young people using secret accounts that they hid from their parents.</p>
<p>“Will you commit to ending finsta?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Senator, let me explain. We don’t actually <i>do</i> finsta. What finsta refers to is young people setting up accounts where they may want to have more privacy,” Davis patiently replied.</p>

<h3>Facebook’s leaked benefits enrollment video</h3>
<p>It must be hard to work at Facebook – or, as it’s called now, Meta – on days when the company is getting loads of bad press for, you know, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/business/january-6-insurrection-facebook-papers/index.html">not doing enough</a> to stop the January 6 insurrection. But it’s also probably hard to work at Facebook when you have to enroll in your benefits.</p>
<p>There’s some pretty awful stuff detailed in the files that Haugen leaked, but if you want to experience some lower-stakes incredulity at our Metaverse overlords, check out this video. I’m sure Facebook has good benefits – they’re a huge, trillion-dollar tech company, after all – but is the subsidized care even worth it when there’s <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/leak-this-internal-facebook-benefits-video-may-be-its-greatest-crime">choreographed dancing</a> involved?</p>
<h3>NFTs aren’t even good at gatekeeping</h3>
<p>Bored Apes Yacht Club is like a fraternity for people who love Coinbase. Instead of paying dues to join an exclusive Greek society of bros, you can buy a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-a-300k-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-was-accidentally-sold-for-3k/">52 ETH</a> (~$210,000 at time of publication) NFT of an ape to be part of a cool club. Yes, Jimmy Fallon, Steph Curry and Post Malone are Yacht Club members – just like how some B-list actor was in your college’s fraternity twenty years before you were born. But it’s not just about the ape – the value of the NFT is that you get access to fancy events and stuff. So, nightlife journalist Adlan Jackson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york">concocted a clever plan</a> to sneak into a Bored Apes party.</p>
<p>As it turned out, a friend’s boss owned an Ape and sent Jackson a screenshot of a QR code that could get them into the party. The bouncers were checking for some wristband from a previous event, though, not the literal NFT, so he was turned away despite his Ape possession. Later in the night, Jackson tried to get in again, and… they simply let him in. No wristband, no NFT, no nothing. So much for exclusivity! Luckily, Jackson was just in time to see The Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas ask on stage, “This is kind of about art, right? NFTs? I don’t know, what the hell. All I know is… a lot of dudes here tonight.”</p>
<h3>Please make it stop</h3>

<p>If NFTs are now blowing up in the speculation bubble that is financial social media (how does that not have a short name? FiSo?) they owe a lot to Gamestop, the memestock that could. The company could have headed into oblivion like so many other mediocre retailers crowded out by innovations in technology, consumer habits and changing tastes in entertainment. But instead, it was picked up and carried on the wings of a wave of hype that drove its price into the stratosphere, leading to so, so many questions about who gets to be the gatekeeper in the world of trading, who makes money, and who are the biggest losers. You hate to see people getting manipulated, but also understand why those who bought in hated to be treated like unempowered peons. No one gets covered in glory in this one. But amazing, there has yet to be a final chapter in this saga: the stock is lower compared to January’s stratospheric peak, but it’s<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"> not that far off</a>.</p>
<h3>Spotify Wrapped is cheugy</h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we know that sharing your Spotify Wrapped round-up is basically just doing free PR for Spotify. But the copywriting on Wrapped read like it was penned by a forty-year-old communications staffer who asked his niece for some phrases that gen-Zers like.Spotify even hired an aura reader named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mysticmichaela/">Mystic Michaela</a> to collaborate with them on generating audio auras. The result? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html">Cheugy</a>.</p>
<p>“There was one podcast that lived in your head, rent-free, all year long,” it said.</p>
<p>“You always understood the assignment.”</p>
<p>“While everyone else was trying to figure out what NFTs were, you had one song on repeat.”</p>
<p>“You deserve a playlist as long as your skincare routine.”</p>

<h3>Elizabeth Holmes has stans</h3>
<p>Former Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was on trial for criminal fraud for over four months this year. But on the first day of the trial, some fans – yes, fans – showed up dressed as Elizabeth Holmes. If you’re blonde, it’s a pretty easy costume – just wear a black turtleneck and some red lipstick, put your hair in a low ponytail, and there you go! You’re ready for the Halloween party!</p>
<p>But these cosplayers were legit, as far as the reporters who talked to them could tell. They really admired Elizabeth Holmes, despite the fact that she may or may not be guilty of serious criminal fraud charges running a company that actively jeopardized people’s health by giving them false blood test results. But to each their own.</p>

<h3>Even LinkedIn wants to be like TikTok</h3>
<p>Basically every social or entertainment platform is finding a way to wedge in a vertically-oriented short form video feed. It makes sense for direct TikTok competitors like Instagram or Snapchat to do this, even though it feels very inorganic and derivative. But toward the end of the year, even companies like Netflix, Spotify, Reddit, Twitter and Pinterest were trying it out. In 2022, Linkedin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/">plans to join them</a>.</p>
<p>The professional networking platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/">tried doing stories</a> this year, but it wasn’t as successful as Instagram at integrating that Snapchat copy-cat feature.</p>
<h3>Fleets fly away</h3>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is shutting down Fleets on August 3, citing low usage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/embed/#?secret=29czuz9uM3" data-secret="29czuz9uM3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then again, Twitter didn’t do so hot with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Fleets</a> either. I guess you could have seen the writing on the wall with this one: Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/">basically sealed Fleets’ fate</a> with its very name. Its own attempt to throw a hat into the short, ephemeral videos never quite struck a note with Twitter users, who mainly love the format precisely for what it does <i>differently</i> from the rest of social media: fast-paced, short punctuations of words and pictures that flutter down from each other with biting humor, searing criticism, perfectly-timed factoids and occasional glimpses of greatness, regardless of your follow numbers. Who really needs another Story format? Especially one launching so late in the day, with no great twist or even easy way to be used?</p>
<h3>Instagram forgot to turn on teen safety features on the web</h3>
<p>In July, Instagram tried to cover its metaphorical ass when it comes to user safety by rolling out some new features. One feature made it so that any new account from a user under 16 would default to private. But Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) put tech journalists to shame by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">unearthing a scoop</a> that was right in front of our eyes for months. If a teen made an Instagram account on the web, it defaulted to public.</p>
<p>To be fair, who even uses Instagram for the web? Still, this felt like a pretty big oversight. Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri had to admit under oath that his team messed up. It was pretty cringe, but at the same time, it’s an alarming, lackadaisical error for a company that’s been repeatedly defending its commitment to teen safety in the Senate this fall.</p>
<h3>The headline of this article</h3>
<p>It was Devin&#8217;s idea. Amanda enthusiastically approved. Still cheugy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to two founders and two investors to nail down the top tips for New Zealand founders looking to put their mark on the markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Zealand, a country of 5 million people in the South Pacific, has witnessed a shifting tech startup landscape over the last couple of years. While some major global companies like Xero, Rocket Lab, LanzaTech and Seequent have shined a spotlight on New Zealand&#8217;s startup scene, the country historically hasn&#8217;t had access to much venture capital.</p>
<p>As a country with an economy that primarily exports agricultural products, the New Zealand startup world has usually relied on funding from a community of high-net-worth individuals and family offices who probably made their millions through real estate or farming.</p>
<p>In March last year, the New Zealand government launched Elevate, an NZD $300 million fund of funds program that&#8217;s been providing millions to local VCs to invest into the startup community to fill the early-stage capital gap. At the same time, foreign investors have been flooding onto the scene, attracted to the small country that has a reputation for producing great companies. Founders and VCs in New Zealand are hopeful that the increase in funding from multiple sources is a signal that technology might just become the country&#8217;s next big industry.</p>
<p>That is, if the momentum that has led to more early-stage capital continues.</p>
<p>We spoke to two founders (Peter Beck of Rocket Lab and Cecilia Robinson of Au Pair Link, My Food Bag and Tend) as well as two investors (Phoebe Harrop, principal at Blackbird Ventures, and Robbie Paul, CEO of Icehouse Ventures) to nail down the top tips for New Zealand founders looking to put their mark on the markets. Here&#8217;s what we learned.</p>
<h2>Think big and back yourself</h2>
<p>New Zealanders typically tend to have an introspective view, failing to think big and globally from day one, Beck said. This is in part due to the fact that Kiwis grow up in a culture that suffers from &#8220;tall poppy syndrome,&#8221; a phenomenon where people who have achieved any measure of success are derided, cut down or sabotaged. As a result, not many people want to be a tall poppy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Play the Kiwi card. New Zealand sits favorably on the minds of the international community.							<cite>Icehouse Ventures CEO Robbie Paul</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to build a company, it&#8217;s incredibly painful, it takes a lot of work,&#8221; Beck told TechCrunch. &#8220;Why would you waste your time building a little company? Let&#8217;s build a big company. So go after big problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to psych yourself up to tackle those big problems, don&#8217;t be too humble. New Zealand consistently punches above its weight and produces world-class entrepreneurs and tech startups, Paul said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back yourself and know you can win on a global stage,&#8221; Paul told TechCrunch. &#8220;While starting on a rock at the bottom of the world comes with challenges, there are plenty of advantages, too.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t get starry-eyed over a big check</h2>
<p>&#8220;Remember that the least valuable thing an investor ever gives you is their money,&#8221; said Beck. &#8220;As you think about building your business, how and where you want to go, make sure you utilize investors to help you get there. People get starry-eyed by the check and don&#8217;t really sit back and go, &#8216;Well, is this person actually strategic to me or not?'&#8221;</p>
<p>When Beck was building Rocket Lab, he was highly selective about the investors he brought in, saying the differentiating factor between investors is not their capital, but rather who they can call. For example, Khosla Ventures participated in Rocket Lab&#8217;s Series A round, which Beck said opened the door to another big VC, Bessemer, to invest, in a Series B. DCVC led the Series C, but by the time Rocket Lab got around to its Series D, Bessemer was paving the way to Greenspring, which is a limited partner (LP) of Bessemer. Sovereign wealth funds, where the real big checks come from, participated in the company&#8217;s E round, and they were LPs of Greenspring.</p>
<p>&#8220;So as your company continues to grow, there are larger and larger pools of capital that you can then go and attract, and if all you&#8217;ve got is John from Pakuranga, John doesn&#8217;t have the phone number and credibility to sovereign wealth funds,&#8221; said Beck. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about setting up the company so that when you want to do a bigger round, you can go and tap that venture capitalist&#8217;s LPs and then it can tap that LP&#8217;s LPs and ultimately end up in sovereign wealth funds or others that can write a $100 million check no problems at all. It&#8217;s a smooth path there, and where it&#8217;s tricky is when there&#8217;s no path or the path is truncated, and the challenge with New Zealand is even though there are some better quality venture capital firms in New Zealand, where are their relationships with LPs?&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I spent a chunk of yesterday morning rediscovering the big trends of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">CES 2012</a>. It’s a strange experience, examining so much technology that feels &#8212; at once &#8212; extremely dated and very recent. With 10 years between you and an event, the macro trends really take shape. Some items are a clear part of a continuum that brings us to the present day. Even more often, however, these things prove to be a kind of evolutionary dead end.</p>
<p>Even so, there’s a lot we can learn in the moment. CES is billed as a bellwether for the year to come. It also demonstrates how the tech world responds to largely global trends, in a one-stop shop. And let’s be real, there’s really one key global trend from the past couple of years that’s going to drive what happens at the show in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve received some pushback on our coverage of big-name drop-outs from the in-person portion of the event. To some degree, I understand &#8212; or at least can empathize with &#8212; the criticism of focusing coverage on COVID-fueled exits, rather than the manufacturer news tied to the event. To that I say, simply, we’ll be covering that, too, only we’ll be doing it next week when it’s actually announced at the show (albeit remotely).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the lead up to the show, however, we can identify/predict the industry trends that are best poised to define CES &#8212; and, perhaps by extension, 2022.</p>
<p>First, the elephant in the room.</p>
<h3>CES drop-outs</h3>
<p>As I write this the list of big-name tech companies that have announced they will be opting out of (or dramatically scaling back from) in-person events includes: GM, Google, Microsoft, AMD, OnePlus, MSI, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Mercedes, BMW, Panasonic, IBM, TikTok and Pinterest. The media side includes TechCrunch, Engadget, The Verge, CNET, PCMag, Tom’s Guide, Tech Radar and more.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a full list &#8212; but it’s surely a lot more than the CTA hoped for. There are, however, still some big names participating, including Samsung, Sony, LG and Qualcomm. Given the late stage at which many companies opted out, those who attend the show are due for a surreal experience, full of big-name, unstaffed booths.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CES dodged the shutdown bullet in 2020 by the skin of its teeth. 2021, meanwhile, felt like a referendum on whether a hardware event at this scale can go entirely virtual. Based on our own experiences of navigating the show online, the answer was decidedly a no. With the CTA planning a return to an in-person event for 2022, I will be interested to see whether the organization has dramatically improved the experience for those who won’t be in Vegas.</p>
<h3>Connected fitness</h3>
<p>The last few years have been huge for this category &#8212; for what should be obvious reasons. Mirror was acquired by Lulu Lemon, Peloton had a banner couple of years (in spite of numerous setbacks) and the funding flowed for a range of different home fitness suppliers. This was fueled by widespread gym closures, coupled with the general inactivity of those forced to stay at home.</p>
<p>There’s been some regression for companies as gyms have reopened in different parts of the country and world, but with the arrival of troubling variants like delta and omicron, many have remained committed to their home workout routines.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Expect more startups trying new wearable form factors, including rings, after Oura proved out success on that side. Mindfulness and sleep will also be focuses, in addition to more traditional health tracking.</p>
<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>As someone who writes a lot about robots, it’s heartening to see them playing an increasingly important role at CES. That includes moving beyond sheer novelty and tried and true form factors like robot vacuums. My list includes exoskeletons, elder tech, agtech, prosthesis and &#8212; at the very top &#8212; disinfecting robots. There are going to be a TON of these, driven by an increased focus on surface-based disease transmission during the pandemic and the fact that it’s reasonably simple to mount UV-C light panels to an autonomous robot that can take laps around an office.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> With last-mile delivery robots taking off in a big way, expect to see a number of newer companies getting in on the act during the show.</p>
<h3>Lidar</h3>
<p>Okay, so Velodyne has opted out of the in-person event, but between robotics, self-driving cars and drones (among others) the demand for lidar is massive. Expect to see a lot of new offers from companies at the show &#8212; both new and old.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> It’s going to be a big year for e-bikes, too. Mark my words.</p>
<h3>Remote work</h3>
<p>This one’s a bit nebulous, I confess, but the pandemic had a profound impact on the category. After years of decline, PC and tablet sales shot up, as people scrambled to build home offices. Even after nearly two years in isolation, there’s still a lot that needs improving with our home setups. If you started building solutions like webcams, lighting, conferencing devices and microphones at the beginning of the pandemic, CES 2022 would be a great place to debut them &#8212; for many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> For the (large number)th year in a row, smart home stuff will occupy a huge portion of mindshare for the show.</p>
<p>CES 2022 kicks off next week. We’ll be there (virtually), so stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/8fd0ef5d-ab98-432b-9486-14fc91b5926d?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>As is tradition on the show, we used the last episode of the year to make predictions about the next year. To continue an annual tradition,<a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall"> Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> joined <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> on the mic, a rare treat and one simply for your enjoyment. Expectedly, they had a lot to say.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248038" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So what did we manifest for 2022? Here&#8217;s a sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We&#8217;re bullish on climate-focused startups:</strong> A notable theme from a number of us was the importance of climate startups, and how many types of startups are going to have a climate-flavor. In short, as the planet changes, it&#8217;s going to touch just about everything. And if sustainability is not your entire pitch, it&#8217;s going to be at least a strategy soon enough.</li>
<li><strong>We had a <em>lot</em> to say about crypto:</strong> Sure, we&#8217;re all a bit tired of talking crypto, but there&#8217;s also no chance that we could get away from the topic when considering next year. The classic tension between reinvention and regulation continues to be a dynamic we all care about, and predict will be full force over the next twelve months.</li>
<li><strong>We&#8217;re not nearly as bullish on media:</strong> The Buzzfeed SPAC had some of us bummed out, but when it came to creators and not just writers, we were a bit more positive. Everything is media, even if everything doesn&#8217;t make money.</li>
<li><strong>Space is controversial:</strong> We won&#8217;t spoil it, but the space chat got a bit spicy. The argument wound up showing an interesting issue in the tech space, namely is all the money going to where it will have the greatest impact?</li>
</ul>
<p>A big hug from the Equity team for your continued listenership this year. Thanks for sticking with us, and we&#8217;re back in a heartbeat with another year&#8217;s shows &#8211; some of which may even be in person!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian antitrust watchdog on Friday ordered an investigation into Apple&#8217;s business practices &#8212; in particular, the company mandating iPhone app developers to use a proprietary payments system &#8212; in India, where the American firm commands less than 2% of the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India, which ordered the Director General to conduct the probe within 60 days, said it is of the prima facie view that the mandatory use of Apple&#8217;s in-app payments system for paid apps and in-app purchases &#8220;restrict[s] the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice especially considering when it charges a commission of up to 30% for app purchases and in-app purchases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The watchdog began reviewing the case after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/report-india-may-be-next-in-line-to-mandate-changes-to-apples-in-app-payment-rules/">a complaint filed by Together We Fight Society</a>, a non-profit based in India&#8217;s western state of Rajasthan. The organization said Apple&#8217;s move, which prevents app developers from using a third-party or their own payments system, makes a significant dent in the revenues they generate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple had urged the CCI to dismiss the case, saying it was too small a player in India.</p>
<p>India is the latest nation to express concerns over Apple and Google requiring app developers to use the firm&#8217;s payments system for in-app purchases. (The Indian watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">opened the investigation</a> into Google&#8217;s business practices last year.) Earlier this year, South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">approved a measure</a> that makes it illegal for Apple and Google to make a commission by forcing developers to use their proprietary payments systems.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Fortnite-maker gaming firm Epic publicly challenged Google and Apple by introducing its own payments system in the sleeper hit title. Now it&#8217;s locked in legal battles with Google and Apple. This year, attorneys general from 36 U.S. states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google alleging its Google Play app store is an illegal monopoly. A bipartisan bill introduced this year in the U.S. Senate seeks to restrict how the Apple and Google app stores operate and what rules can be imposed on app developers.</p>
<p>The European Union last year proposed the Digital Markets Act, which is meant to prevent technology platforms from abusing their gatekeeper position.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At this stage, it appears that the lack of competitive constraint in the distribution of mobile apps is likely to affect the terms on which Apple provide[s] access to its App Store to the app developers, including the commission rates and terms that thwart certain app developers from using other in-app payment systems,&#8221; the CCI wrote Friday in a 20-page order.</p>
<p>The CCI said it is also worth probing whether Apple uses data it collects from the users of its competitors to &#8220;improve its own services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-india-q4-2020/">a considerable uptick in iPhone sales in India</a> in recent years, Apple is still a small player in the market. Google&#8217;s Android commands a marketshare that swings between 98 to 99% each year.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Apple for comment.</p>

<p>The push by countries at all levels of development to modernize their information and communications networks has created unprecedented demand for technological infrastructure. Governments and industry are investing billions of dollars to expand digital connectivity worldwide. New deployments of 4G, 5G, satellites and fiber-optic cables could create huge opportunities for host nations but pose significant risks if networks are built without adequate safeguards. The U.S. has a role to play in securing the future of the internet and the global digital economy but will need to move beyond confrontation with China to succeed.</p>
<h2>China’s network effects</h2>
<p>Digital access is the foundation for digital services, like fintech and e-commerce, that connect communities to trade and financial resources. As startups in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">Latin America</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/11/19/global-investment-money-is-flooding-into-africas-fintechs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> draw billions in investment, their services require a strong and wide-reaching information communications technology (ICT) backbone to flourish.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Due to <a href="https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/huawei-and-the-ambiguity-of-chinas-intelligence-and-counter-espionage-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal</a> <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obligations to the Chinese state</a> — including sharing customer data at its request — China’s tech firms cannot guarantee that they will put their clients first. Many firms also host <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-challenge-communist-corporate-governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal Party organizations</a> that influence decision-making. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is not omnipotent — some companies have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow-rolled compliance</a> with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/93451b98-da12-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information requests</a> — but the CPC’s ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">crackdown</a> on tech companies is diminishing their ability to circumvent directives.</p>
<p>But because network modernization is an economic imperative and Chinese firms often offer lower prices than their global competitors, many countries choose to source their technology despite these political and security hazards.</p>
<p>While the risks posed by companies such as Huawei are <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/c2b/c2b-log/whats-the-deal-with-huawei-and-this-african-union-headquarters-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not evidence</a> of collaboration with China’s government, these legal and institutional pressures, combined with engineers’ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-technicians-helped-african-governments-spy-on-political-opponents-11565793017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track record of spying</a> for other national governments, such as in Uganda and Zambia, suggest that even China’s most powerful ICT companies can be susceptible to co-option. As the digital economy grows and diversifies, more kinds of data, from personal communications to financial, business, health and other sensitive information will become vulnerable to a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/how-to-avoid-falling-into-chinas-data-trap/">data trap</a>.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While state intervention is not guaranteed, the CPC’s approach to foreign affairs heightens that likelihood. Beijing wants international audiences to accommodate its priorities and activities and pursues “<a href="https://www.hudson.org/research/17119-china-s-gambit-for-total-information-dominance-a-us-australia-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information dominance</a>” with that purpose in mind. Data is important for understanding the information environment and shaping perceptions of the CPC, so access to and influence over ICT infrastructure — the vehicle for modern communications — makes the companies that provide it pivotal to Chinese foreign policy.</p>
<p>Information dominance also means preference for CPC-friendly content and platforms, which hinders opportunities for local populations. For example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/23/business/startimes-china-africa-kenya-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarTimes</a>, a Beijing-based media company that upgraded and operates television networks in 30 African countries, received hundreds of millions of dollars from China’s EXIM Bank to enter African markets. It offers state-run media channels in its cheapest subscriptions or even for free which “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/07/china-plan-for-global-media-dominance-propaganda-xi-jinping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tell the China story well</a>” to local audiences, at the cost of excluding bandwidth dedicated to local perspectives or media free from CPC propaganda.</p>
<h2>America’s response: Still loading</h2>
<p>In response to the spread of China’s network projects, U.S. policymakers have begun to tackle vendor security assessments and expand government mechanisms to finance ICT. Buried under the Trump administration’s “us or China” rhetoric, the State Department’s <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/the-clean-network/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Network</a> initiative included <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/200511_Lewis_5G_v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country-agnostic criteria</a> for assessing vendor-based cyber risks and support for the multilateral <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/PRG_proposals_SP_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prague Proposals</a>, which underscored non-technical aspects of 5G security. The administration also retooled the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/04/belt-and-road-initiative-bri-build-back-better-us-china-competition-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. International Development Finance Corporation</a> (DFC) to better support digital modernization and network construction. In an early victory for DFC, Ethiopia selected a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-tech-fight-opens-new-front-in-ethiopia-11621695273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone-led group</a> in lieu of a bid linked to China’s Silk Road Fund, despite long-standing relationships with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579212092223818288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei and ZTE</a> to supply telecommunications.</p>
<p>These developments highlight the U.S. commitment to generating alternatives, in collaboration with other countries. But these measures alone may be insufficient to address the scale of China’s approach. In addition to vast government investments into overseas projects, China has subsidized its tech giants to such an extent that Huawei once proposed a 5G project at “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-huawei-the-5g-play-is-in-europe--and-the-us-is-pushing-hard-for-a-ban-there/2019/05/28/582a8ff6-78d4-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a price that wouldn’t even cover the cost of parts</a>.”</p>
<p>The United States, while motivated to offset China’s influence, should not look to outspend it or mimic its approach. Instead, U.S. leadership should mobilize a variety of sustainable investments, find technology solutions to make tech adoption cheaper and pitch neutral infrastructure that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/to-protect-the-future-of-the-internet-us-led-tech-diplomacy-must-change-tack/">offer equitable opportunities</a> for local economies.</p>
<p>The White House should spearhead creation of a <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/edge-networks-core-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multilateral digital development bank</a> to make more resources available to states looking to modernize their networks. Doing so would also add heft to commitments the Biden administration has made under the G7’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-launch-build-back-better-world-b3w-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build Back Better World</a> initiative.</p>
<p>In coordination with Congress, the Biden administration should also back efforts to lower the cost of equipment itself to sustainably compete with China’s low-priced kit. One solution is interoperability in technology standards; <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/open-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open RAN</a> for 5G networks is one example of how this approach has already proven <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wireless-networks-dish-rakuten-cloud-11634000875?mod=tech_lead_pos12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less expensive</a> than traditional network architecture.</p>
<p>Another avenue to lower costs is to invest in research and development for <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/edge-networks-core-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network technologies</a> that can replace the most expensive legacy components. For example, fiber-optic cables are expensive to deploy on land; workarounds may include wireless optic solutions or integration of satellite mesh networks with terrestrial systems.</p>
<p>Finally, the White House should explore ways to integrate <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net neutrality</a> principles into network financing projects run by agencies such as DFC. Net neutrality could offer economic benefits to host nations by keeping the digital playing field open for local media and innovation. Neutral networks would set the foundation for a third way forward from what has been criticized as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-digital-colonialism-espionage-silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital colonization</a> by China’s government and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar criticisms</a> of the U.S. private sector.</p>
<p>A digital network is ultimately a means to an end: infrastructure for interpersonal communications, content, services, industry and innovation. While few countries, at least for now, supply ICT infrastructure to the majority of the world, that majority should have full access to the opportunities it can offer. A revised route to digital modernization, premised on open participation, can not only offset the local costs of China’s cyber and influence power, but pave the way for an equitable internet for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In late March last year, as the virus started to spread across India, investors began to worry about the impact a potential pandemic could have on their portfolio firms.</p>
<p>They exchanged notes, and on April 1, penned a joint open letter to the local startup ecosystem, advising firms to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/investors-tell-indian-startups-to-prepare-for-the-worst-as-covid-19-uncertainty-continues/">prepare for the worst</a>.”</p>
<p>In the months that followed, the virus engulfed the South Asian market and, among other things, hit the brakes on funding activity. Scrambling to steer through the unprecedented event, startups began to cut expenses. Some didn’t survive, and a few got acquired in fire sales. Many entrepreneurs and investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">stepped up and volunteered</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/investors-startup-founders-in-india-pool-13m-to-fund-projects-that-fight-coronavirus/">help the nation fight the pandemic, too</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Investors were right about the impact the virus would have on the country, and by extension, on the firms attempting to fuel the economy. But very few were prepared for what was about to happen in just a few quarters.</p>
<p>Scores of startups, many operating in edtech and fintech categories, began to report fast growth. “We started to see three years and five years of growth in one year,” said Ashish Dave, chief executive of Mirae Asset Venture’s India business.</p>
<p>While several investors, including many tier 1 funds that are generally very active in India, were still cautious, a group of investors including Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital, and SoftBank shifted into a higher gear.</p>
<p>Navroz Udwadia of Alpha Wave Global (formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital) said in a conference earlier this year that his firm likes to get aggressive when most other funds are cautious about the market conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">backed Infra.Market in February this year</a>, propelling the business-to-business e-commerce platform’s valuation from $200 million to over $1 billion in a span of two months.</p>
<p>In a letter to investors in February, Tiger Global said the opportunity it sees in areas such as consumer, enterprise, and financial technology in the U.S., China, and India is “very large relative to the amount of capital we manage and evolving at a rate that is often hard to comprehend.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-2252298 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="270" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=768,305 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=680,270 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-unique-investors.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Several factors worked in India&#8217;s favor, many investors said. There’s an abundance of dry powder in the market and investors are increasingly looking at growth avenues such as emerging regions as their next big bets. It also helped that Beijing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">enforced a series of crackdowns</a> on its own startups and made it difficult for foreign money to flow into China.</p>
<p>Another thing swinging in favor of India was the record number of IPOs that we saw this year. Food delivery firm Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar debut</a>. Fashion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/indian-fashion-e-commerce-nykaa-makes-stellar-market-debut/">commerce Nykaa</a>, online insurer PolicyBazaar also made strong debuts on the stock exchanges. Paytm filed for the nation&#8217;s largest IPO, though the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">public market is still giving it less valuation than it sought</a>.</p>
<p>Dave said Indian startups going public addressed the exit challenge that many investors have faced over the years.</p>
<p>The investors’ bullishness on India was on full display in April, when the virus was beginning to gain pace again in the country.</p>
<p>Eight Indian startups &#8212; including social commerce Meesho, fintech CRED, investment platform Groww, business-to-business messaging platform Gupshup, payments firm Chargebee &#8212; joined the unicorn club in April. Tiger minted five of these unicorns.</p>
<p>The sudden flow of cash also created a crunch for talent in the market. Startups began to offer lucrative stock options and salary hikes to employees to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">win and retain them</a>.</p>
<p>In total, capital flowing to private Indian startups surged over four times to about $39 billion this year and nearly three times from the previous best of $14.6 billion in 2019, according to data from insight platform Tracxn, which has also filed for an IPO.</p>
<p>India now has 81 unicorns, 44 of which joined the club this year. Several of the unicorns and many other fast growing startups have raised multiple rounds this year and increased their valuations multiple times over. Fintech <a href="http://sliceit.com/">Slice</a>, which is giving millions of Indians access to credit card features and helping them build credit scores, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">increased its valuation multiple-fold</a> in a recent round it raised from Insight Partners and Tiger Global.</p>
<p>CRED, for instance, has raised three funding rounds and has held talks for a fourth one, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/indian-fintech-cred-seeks-funds-at-5-5-billion-valuation/">TechCrunch reported earlier</a>. Indian edtech giant Byju&#8217;s has raised over $1.5 billion since last year. Instant grocery delivery startup Zepto, co-founded by two 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, doubled its valuation to $570 million in a span of two months.</p>
<p>Fintech startup <a href="https://www.myjar.app">Jar</a>, which is helping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tribe-and-arkam-back-jar-app-to-help-millions-in-india-start-their-savings-journey/">hundreds of thousands of Indians start their investment journey</a>, is about to close a round from a high-profile investor, said two people familiar with the matter. The startup, founded this year, is likely to increase its valuation by about 15 times in the new round.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.questbook.app">QuestBook</a>, which is helping developers transition to web3, is about to close a round from a number of investors including entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, according to a person familiar with the matter. Polygon is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/vcs-eye-investment-in-polygon/">talks to raise from Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital</a>, TechCrunch reported this month. (Also Amazon is in talks to back an agritech startup, per two people familiar with the matter.)</p>
<p>Ramakant Sharma, founder of Livspace, is working on a crypto startup called &#8220;TheSpiderMan,&#8221; according to three people familiar with the matter and investor deck reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Startups have become mainstream in India,” said Dave, pointing to a number of recent developments including the arrival of Shark Tank in the country. “Indian parents are no longer hesitant to tell their friends that their kid works at a startup or has founded one. Everyone now knows what a startup is. For years, I had to explain to my dad what I do for a living!”</p>
<p>Tiger Global, which has made over 50 investments in India this year, is currently conducting due diligence to back an additional nine startups in the country, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank and Alpha Wave Global have also deployed serious capital in the country. SoftBank has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">invested over $3 billion in India this year</a>, whereas Alpha Wave Global has poured over $2 billion.</p>
<p>The frenetic pace at which some of these firms have written checks to Indian startups this year has also forced many of their global peers to take India more seriously. Temasek, which typically backs late stage startups, has made a record 20 investments in India this year.</p>
<p>Insight Partners, which became more prolific in India this year, made some changes to its investment process in the country to speed up the time it takes to back a startup, two people familiar with the matter said. It’s currently engaging to back Indian NFT platform Faze, according to two people with knowledge of those proceedings.</p>
<p>General Catalyst is building a team in India, too. The firm is also in talks to back a number of startups including OneCode, a person familiar with the matter said. Andreessen Horowitz made its first investment in India this year. B Capital Group has also appointed a new India head.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-2252299 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="269" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-first-time-investors.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>“Tiger has changed the game,” said Dave. “Every fund on the planet has at some point relooked and reassessed their strategy and tried to figure out what is the best they can do. Not everyone can play Tiger’s game. But what is the next best you can do? Because you can’t play the same game that you used to.”</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India, which has been investing in India for over a decade, remains the most prolific investor in India and Southeast Asia. It has made over 60 investments this year.</p>
<p>Dave said he expects the pace of investments to continue in the new year. “The market will continue to become more competitive. Just look at the number of people who are beginning to do angel investing.”</p>
<p>“Overseas, the market is huge. The number of investors and firms are also very large. That’s still not the case in India. So the competition for good deals is very high.”</p>
