										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTHUNvsf3jM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In the early days of social media, all things seemed possible. Twitter was this weird reboot of blogs, with a social layer atop an RSS feed that gave authority to last in/first out musings by providing data not just about read or unread but shared by who. You could take that authority data and rank posts by who shared them and who followed those people and what they in turn recommended. Although this was mostly ignored at the time by vendors and writers looking for a viral eyeball payoff, for those looking to support new talent there was something more valuable than reach.</p>
<p>Something like that could happen with Clubhouse and newsletters. On this week&#8217;s edition of the Gillmor Gang, recorded just over a week ago, we talk about Clubhouse, the Facebook advisory board and its siderstep of the Trump deplatforming, and early stuff I can never quite remember because the show always takes a bit too long to fully get up to speed. I&#8217;d apologize for this, but the apology would take too long to reach sincerity sufficient to not make things worse. This by the way is why newsletters exist — to save time scouring the Web and cable news for a sufficient return on investment, as in &#8220;well there&#8217;s another [duration] I&#8217;ll never get back.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Temporal time displacement suffered a serious blow at the hands of HBO Max and its strategy of releasing theater-less blockbusters on the streaming network in 2021 but only intermittently moving forward. As the CDC noted in a confusing but welcome announcement this past Thursday, vaccines are making possible a safe return to theaters in the near future. Soon it will be possible to be confused about the movie Tenet on the big screen. It is not a spoiler to say that Tenet is all about moving through time in the normal forward but also the incomprehensible backward. Time travel stories are invariably brought to a complete standstill when how this works is explained. The only thing harder to do is find a way to end a Saturday Night Live sketch. The only rationale appears to be that the sketch is over, like a bad pun not even worthy of a groan.</p>
<p>Speaking as I was of Clubhouse, we tried it out last Wednesday with Keith Teare and a brief drive-by from Brent Leary. Somehow we were in Hallway mode, which actually captured the feel of the thing nicely. Being in experimental mood, I added anyone who showed up as a speaker whether they wanted to or not. The result felt like a remnant of my childhood in Woodstock, NY, where we were part of a party line with nearby neighbors. You&#8217;d be talking with someone and suddenly realize someone else was on the line, interrupting to basically say they needed to make a more important call. Awkward but oddly exhilarating, as you realized the potential of not only lurking but lurked. I&#8217;m not sure how this is useful or not, but remember that @mentions and retweets were invented not by Twitter but by users. And using Twitter like a party line turned out to be the true superpower of the social network. On Clubhouse, if no one had anything to say, they were quiet. It was very peaceful.</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise was a listener/speaker from Manchester, England who professed to being a longtime listener to the Gang. He and Keith, also from Manchester, started talking about Manchester United, an important football team I know nothing about. An old friend from the conference circuit popped in and our producer/director Tina Chase Gillmor somehow started up a conversation about my alleged style as a writer. Talking about me is easily my least favorite thing to do, but having others do the job is high on my most list. It&#8217;s also acutely reminiscent of the tech conference hallway conversation stubbed out by the pandemic. I now started to understand why Hallway mode was so-called. It&#8217;s the grease of the wheel business rides on. Follow the Gillmor Gang club on Clubhouse and you&#8217;ll be notified about our next experiment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Kia EV6, an all-electric crossover that kicks off the automaker&#8217;s Plan S strategy to shift away from internal combustion engines and toward EVs, will come to the U.S. early next year, the company said Tuesday evening during a live streamed event in New York.</p>
<p>The EV6 is the first dedicated battery-electric vehicle to built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, a platform that is shared with Hyundai and Genesis as part of the Hyundai Motor Group. The EGM-platform is the underlying foundation of the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 compact crossover. And it&#8217;s one of 11 electric vehicles that Kia plans to deliver globally by 2026.</p>
<p>Kia said its new dedicated battery electric vehicles will all start with the &#8220;EV&#8221; prefix. A number will follow &#8220;EV&#8221; to indicate the vehicle&#8217;s position in the lineup. That puts the EV6 somewhere in the middle of its upcoming lineup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the global debut held earlier this year provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/kias-electric-vehicle-plans-take-shape-with-ev6-teaser-new-naming-strategy/">many of the details</a>, a few new nuggets of information were shared, including that customers can make reservations for 1,500 first edition versions of the EV6 beginning June 3. The automaker has not revealed pricing for any of the vehicle trims.</p>
<p>The EV6 First Edition will be similar to the base model with lots of techie add-ons, including an augmented reality head-up display, remote smart parking assist feature, 14-speaker Meridian audio system and a two-year subscription to SiriusXM. There will be notable mechanical and exterior differences as well, including a wide sunroof, 20-inch wheels, dual-motor AWD and a 77.4 kWh battery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154505" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154505" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154505 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17379_2022_EV6.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154505" class="wp-caption-text">2022 EV6 <strong>Image credit</strong>: Kia</p></div></p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Kia designed the EV6 to look and perform like a roomy sports car. The four-door crossover has a low front end that moves up into a roofline, giving it coupe-like profile. The LED headlights have a segmented pattern and the traditional grille found on internal combustion engine vehicles is gone.</p>
<p>The EV6 has the same 114.2-inch wheelbase as the Kia Telluride, which gives some sense of its size.</p>
<p>The Kia EV6 will come with two Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese battery pack options — a 58 kWh or 77.4 kWh — with the larger one providing a targeted range of 300 miles. The vehicle is offered in both rear-wheel and AWD, which depending on the electric motor and battery configuration delivers between 167 and 313 horsepower. The EV6 GT, an AWD model that comes with the larger battery and powerful front and rear electric motors, delivers 567 horsepower. The GT model, which won&#8217;t be available until late 2022, can travel from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, is that the vehicle supports 400-volt and 800-volt DC charging. Kia claims that 800v DC fast charging from a 350-kW charger can add up to 210 miles to the battery in under 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Kia loaded up on various charging features. The EV6 has an onboard 11 kW charger for Level 2 charging that will power up the battery in about seven hours. There&#8217;s also what Kia calls vehicle-to-load functionality, which is jargony way of saying the EV6 can be a power source for appliances, tools and devices like a computer. It works by taking electricity from the battery to a charging control unit, which provides 1900 watts of power.</p>
<p>The user is able to plug into that power via a 100v outlet located in a socket on front of second row seat base. If the battery is fully charged, Kia says power  can be drawn from the vehicle for 36 or more consecutive hours. It can also be used to charge vehicle-to-vehicle, albeit at 1.1 kW, which is a glacial pace that is equivalent to a 110V charger.</p>

<p>There are numerous other driver assistance, safety and in-car tech features as well. Inside the vehicle, are two 12-inch screens that form a curved display and house the instrument cluster and infotainment center. There is Bluetooth functionality and wireless smartphone charging, which has become standard fare in modern vehicles.</p>
<p>For an extra fee, customers can add on a Wi-FI hotspot and the ability to update the maps and infotainment system software wirelessly. Other features include a in-car commerce feature called Kia Pay, a stolen vehicle recovery tracker, smartwatch accessibility that provides battery status, vehicle notifications and certain vehicle control through Apple and Android smartwatches and connected car functions for weather and routing.</p>
<p>Customers are also able to use Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant through a smart speaker integration to remotely control vehicle functions such as remote start.</p>
<p>Four cameras outside of the vehicle give a 360-degree view and help with to detect obstructions while parking along with several other safety features including a safe exit assist that alerts the driver or passengers opening the door to not exit if the system spots approaching traffic.</p>
<p>There is also 21 standard active advanced driver assistance systems including a feature that keeps a set distance from a car in front and centers the EV6 in the lane. A newer version of this feature will be able to assist with assist with lane changes and adjust the lateral position of the car within the lane, according to Kia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a>, a deep-tech investment firm, announced the first close of its fifth fund, which is expected to total 30 billion JPY (or about $275 million USD) by June 2021. UTEC currently has about $780 million in total assets under management, and says this makes it one of the largest venture capital funds focused on science and tech in Japan, and one of the largest deep-tech funds in Asia.</p>
<p>UTEC is an independent firm that works closely with universities. It is associated with The University of Tokyo (UTokyo), where it has a partnership with its Technology Licensing Office (TLO) to spin off and invest in companies that originated as research projects. It has also worked with researchers from Waseda University, Kyoto University, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cambridge University, the National University of Singapore and the Indian Institute of Technology, among other institutions.</p>

<p>UTEC&#8217;s portfolio already includes more than 80 Japanese startups and 30 startups from other places, including the United States, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. So far, 25 of its investments have exited. Thirteen went public and now have an aggregated market cap of about $15 billion, and 12 were through mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Some of its exits include 908 Devices, a mass spectrometry company that <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/research-device-developer-908-devices-raises-range-to-%2418-to-%2419-ahead-of-%24116-million-ipo">went public on Nasdaq last year</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/fyusion-is-bringing-3d-vision-technologies-to-a-device-near-you/">Fyusion</a>, a computer vision startup <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cox-automotive-acquires-fyusion-301200890.html">acquired by Cox Automotive</a>; and Phyzios, which was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/google-acquires-phyzios--1e577118">acquired by Google in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>About half of UTEC&#8217;s portfolio are university spin-offs. For companies that originated in academic research, UTEC supports their commercialization by helping hire crucial talent, including executive positions, business development and go-to-market strategies. The firm’s first check size is about $500,000 to $5 million, and it also usually provides follow-on capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.studentfinance.com/">StudentFinance</a> &#8212; which allows educational institutions to offer success-based financing for students &#8212; has raised a $5.3 million (€4.5 million) seed round co-led by Giant Ventures and Armilar Venture Partners. It’s now raised $6.6 million total, to date.</p>
<p>StudentFinance launched in Spain first, followed by Germany and Finland, with the U.K. planned this year. Existing investors Mustard Seed Maze and Seedcamp, along with Sabadell Venture Capital, also participated.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched at the beginning of 2020, provides the tech back end for institutions to offer flexible payment plans in the form of ISAs (income-share agreements). It also provides data intelligence on the employment market to predict job demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has 35 education providers signed up, managing over €5 million worth of ISAs. It also works with upskilling platforms including Ironhack and Le Wagon. StudentFinance’s competitors include (in the USA) Blair, Leif, Vemo Education, Chancen (Germany-based) and EdAid (U.K.-based).</p>
<p>As for why StudentFinance stands out from those companies, Mariano Kostelec, co-founder and CEO of StudentFinance, said: “StudentFinance is the only platform in this space providing the full end-to-end, cross-border infrastructure to deliver ISAs for students whilst helping to plug the growing skills gap. Not only do we provide the infrastructure to support the ISA financing model, but we also provide data intelligence on the employment market and a career-as-a-service platform that focuses on placing students in the right job. We are creating an equilibrium between supply and demand.”</p>
<p>With an ISA, students only start paying back tuition once they are employed and earning above a minimum income threshold, with payments structured as a percentage of their earnings. This makes it a &#8220;success-based model&#8221;, says StudentFinance, which shifts the risk away from the students. They are likely to be popular as workers need to reskill with the onset of digitization and the pandemic’s effects.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2019 by Kostelec, Marta Palmeiro, Sergio Pereira and Miguel Santo Amaro. Kostelec and Santo Amaro previously built Uniplaces, which raised $30 million as a student housing platform in Europe.</p>
<p>Cameron Mclain, managing partner of Giant Ventures, commented: “What StudentFinance has built empowers any educational institution to offer ISAs as an alternative to upfront tuition or student loans, broadening access to education and opportunity.”</p>
<p>Duarte Mineiro, partner at Armilar Venture Partners, commented: “StudentFinance is a great opportunity to invest in because aside from its very compelling core purpose, this is a sound business where its economics are backed by a solid proprietary software technology.”</p>
<p>Sia Houchangnia, partner at Seedcamp, commented: “The need for reskilling the workforce has never been as acute as it is today and we believe StudentFinance has an important role to play in tackling this societal challenge.”</p>
<p>Angel backers include investors, which includes: Victoria van Lennep (founder of Lendable); Martin Villig (founder of Bolt); Ed Vaizey (the U.K.’s longest-serving Culture &amp; Digital Economy Minister); Firestartr (U.K.-based early-stage VC); Serge Chiaramonte (U.K. fintech investor); and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the end of the year, more than 10 car models from Volvo, GM, Renault and Polestar will be powered by the Android Automotive operating system — and all of the built-in Google apps and services that come with it. Now, the company is making it easier for third-party developers to bring their navigation, EV charging, parking and media apps directly to a car&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>Google announced Tuesday at its annual developer conference that it&#8217;s extending its <a href="https://developer.android.com/cars">Android for Cars App Library</a>, which is available as part of Jetpack, to support the Android Automotive operating system. This is good news for developers who can now create an app that is compatible with two different, but sometimes overlapping platforms: Android OS and Android Auto. It also means developers can create one app that should work seamlessly between various makes and models of vehicles.</p>
<p>Google said Tuesday it is already working with Early Access Partners, including Parkwhiz, Plugshare, Sygic, ChargePoint, Flitsmeister, SpotHero and others to bring apps in these categories to cars powered by Android Automotive OS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2154493" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PlugShare.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154493" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PlugShare.gif" alt="PlugShare Google Android Automotive OS" width="1600" height="960" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn’t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system. Android Auto is an app that runs on the user&#8217;s phone and wirelessly communicates with the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Meanwhile, Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so automakers could use it in their cars.  Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for sometime. But in recent years automakers have worked with the tech company to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Many third-party developers like Spotify have used the Android for Cars App Library to create and publish their Android Auto apps to the Play Store. By extending the Cars App to the operating system, developers will only need to build once.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Google opened its Android Automotive operating system to third-party developers to bring music and other entertainment apps into vehicle infotainment systems. Polestar 2, the all-electric vehicle developed by Volvo’s standalone electric performance brand, was the first. And more have followed, including the Volvo XC40 Recharge.</p>
<p>Companies interested in participating in the early access program will have to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qu-KzNZH260dbZlDSXEHMkd1iqm2fMv2AoFxPozeXgs/viewform?resourcekey=0-tLnNLS30DedMsLJKmVstfw&amp;edit_requested=true">this interest form</a>, according to Google.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roofer Pro. Roof Snap. Acculynx. There&#8217;s suddenly no shortage of companies offering software to make easier the lives of roofers and their customers. Among these is <a href="https://roofr.com/">Roofr</a>, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based, 31-person sales platform for roofing contractors that just raised $4.25 million in post-seed funding led by Bullpen Capital, with participation from Avidbank and previous backer Crosslink Capital.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Rich Nelson is aware of the competition. But as a third-generation roofer by trade, he also knows well that the industry is far from overcoming its reputation as rife with sketchy, flaky contractors whose customers often question whether they need a new roof or suspect the estimates they are given are wildly inflated.</p>
<p>He also knows &#8212; as do his investors &#8212; how big a market opportunity Roofr and its rivals are chasing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a massive, massive market,&#8221; says Nelson. &#8220;On average, every year, roughly five million buildings in the U.S. have their roof replaced,&#8221; and they spend $50 billion toward that end, he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, Roofr is focused exclusively on helping close that initial sale. It all starts with a picture of a roof that Roofr obtains from partner companies like <a href="https://www.nearmap.com/us/en">Nearmap</a>, whose planes cover cities at low altitude to take high-definition pictures, including of roofs. Roofr software then allows these contractors to draw their own roof measurement reports through these drone, blueprint and satellite images and produce a report, or they can pay Roofr $10 per report to measure the roof for them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 made the software more attractive to both roofing contractors and customers who weren&#8217;t keen on being in close proximity during the pandemic. Offerings like Roofr&#8217;s made it possible to quickly and easily send a potential customer a quote without visiting the job site. The bet now is that growing awareness over the product will continue to fuel that momentum.</p>
<p>The company also has new offerings in the pipeline that may make it more compelling to both roofers and their clients. In addition to quickly providing roofers with measurement data, for example, roofers can now pay a monthly fee to have Roofr auto-populate an estimate based on a specific materials list, as well as the profit margin the roofer wants to incorporate; it also now provides and preserves digital contracts.</p>
<p>As for its current customer base, Nelson says that it includes the largest roofing contractors in North America, but that Roofr is even more interested in small businesses, which, while fragmented, represent a much bigger opportunity. He says that there are more than 100,000 registered roofing businesses in the U.S., and that the vast majority are comprised of five employees or fewer. (Roofr also sells its software to independent insurance adjusters.)</p>
<p>The new round brings Roofr&#8217;s total funding to $8.25 million. Crosslink led its initial seed round in early 2019. Roofr also raised money from Y Combinator when it passed through the accelerator program in 2017.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>As summer kicks into gear, the IPO market is mimicking the season by cranking up its temperature. Today, TechCrunch explored the IPO filings from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">venture-backed Marqeta</a> and <a href="https://t.co/XUZg5g5s0L">software startup WalkMe</a>. Squarespace direct lists later this week, along with public debuts from Oatly and Procore on Thursday. All this is great news for late-stage startups and their backers. Not to mention lots of tech workers around the world.</p>
<p>Also today, the fine folks at the <a href="https://www.webbyawards.com/">Webbys</a> announced that TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/equity-podcast/">Equity</a>, is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/techcrunchs-equity-podcast-wins-a-webby-award/">best of its kind</a> in the technology category. We’re stoked! &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021/"><strong>Google hosts its yearly developer event</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">advertising</span> search company kicked off its yearly developer confab today, with the remote event showing off new tech including the ability to have a conversation with Pluto. Or a paper airplane. In more serious terms, Google has new AI chips that look pretty darn cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/"><strong>Our deep-dive into Expensify continues</strong></a><strong>:</strong> As Expensify gets closer and closer to its public offering, TechCrunch’s coverage of the company’s history and growth continues. In today’s entry we also got to feature my favorite quote in years. Per CEO David Barrett, “Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.” Agreed.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/"><strong>Piano shows there’s big money in subscription tech</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We have a sheaf of funding round below, but the Piano deal stood out as it’s actually tech we use at TechCrunch. So, we’re super familiar with it. The news is that Piano has just closed an $88 million round, a deal that includes <em>LinkedIn</em> as an investor. Both the dollar amount <em>and</em> the investor list that the transaction sports are notable.</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch covered our usual daily delivery of funding rounds today, a list that skewed later-stage today. So, from the land of big dollars:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/explorium-scores-75m-series-c-just-10-months-after-b-round/"><strong>Explorium scores $75M Series C</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This new deal comes less than a year after Explorium closed its Series B round, so something is happening at the company that has investors taking note. In short, Explorium helps “data pros find the best data for a given model” according to our own Ron Miller. And it’s apparently big business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/extend-raises-260m-on-a-1-6b-valuation-to-expand-its-warranty-and-protection-plan-services/"><strong>Extend raises $260M at a $1.6B valuation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The warranty space is pretty hot at the moment. Just days after M25-backed Upsie <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/consumer-warranty-startup-scoops-up-182m">raised an $18.2 million round</a>, Extend picked up just over 14x as much capital to help retailers and brands offer warranties more efficiently, and, as Ingrid Lunden reports, help “consumers buy and file claims against them.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fintech-startup-vise-raises-65-million-in-series-c-led-by-ribbit-capital/"><strong>Vise raises $65M Series C</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The fintech world is hot, but not only when it comes to backend-infra services like Plaid, or shiny consumer plays like Chime. Vise provides portfolio-crunching services to indie financial advisors (hence its name, we presume), and has made enough process since its last round to entice Ribbit Capital to lead its latest private cash infusion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/klaviyo-series-d/"><strong>Klayvio raises $320M at a $9.5B valuation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Recent EC-1 subject Klayvio’s latest round is proof that email is far, far from dead. The email marketing company told TechCrunch that its customer count “doubled over the past 12 months and [that it] now serves over 70,000 paying customers, a more than 110% increase from 2019.” That explains the new raise, and its nearly decacorn valuation.</p>
<p>In the honorable mention category, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/styra-the-startup-behind-open-policy-agent-nabs-40m-to-expand-its-cloud-native-authorization-tools/">Styra raised $40 million</a> (it’s best known for Open Policy Agent), commission-free trading startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/commission-free-trading-app-stake-secures-30m-from-tiger-global-to-expand-into-europe/">Stake raised $30 million</a> to expand in Europe, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">Beta Technologies raised $368 million</a> to keep working on electric airplanes.</p>
<h2>Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, it takes 7-8 years for a successful startup to achieve an exit. But there&#8217;s a simple way to speed up the clock: Bring in one or more founders who have previous executive experience.</p>
<p>According to data gathered by Rob Olson, partner and head of data strategy at venture engine M13, startups that have two or more experienced founders tend to exit 33% faster and raise 34% less capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combined, these two improvements can nearly double an investor’s rate of return,&#8221; says Olson.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is all about Google and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021/">I/O event</a>. If you are super busy and just want the highlights, here you go:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI: </strong>Google has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/">new AI chips</a> that it is super proud of, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-cloud-launches-vertex-a-new-managed-machine-learning-platform/">announced Vertex AI</a>, a “new managed machine learning platform that is meant to make it easier for developers to deploy and maintain their AI models.” Keep in mind how competitive and cutthroat the public cloud world is. Here’s Google taking a stand from third place in that particular scrap.</li>
<li><strong>Android: </strong>We all knew that Android was popular, but I have to admit that I did not expect the software service to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-now-powers-3b-devices/">found a home in some 3,000,000,000 devices</a>. That’s nearly one device for every two humans and Google is keeping the ball rolling by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">teasi</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">ng</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/"> Android’s 12 iteration at I/O</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Canvas:</strong> Google’s various productivity apps are getting needed love, the company announced. In the mix is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-interconnects-its-workspace-apps-adds-a-dozen-new-features/">news about Smart canvas</a>, which we described as a “set of new collaborative workspace tools.” What matters more than any single point of news about Docs and friends is that Google is not giving up on them. Which means that, for those of us like myself who live in Google’s productivity suite, we have goodies coming. Good.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you pour through the news out of Google I/O, we wondered … <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">does the latest Android 12 preview</a> make you want to switch from an iPhone? <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1394724650857476098">Let us know.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year&#8217;s I/O event from Google was heavy on the &#8220;we&#8217;re building something cool&#8221; and light on the &#8220;here&#8217;s something you can use or buy tomorrow.&#8221; But there were also some interesting surprises from the semi-live event held in and around the company&#8217;s Mountain View campus. Read on for all the interesting bits.</p>
<h2>Android 12 gets a fresh new look and some quality of life features</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/material-you-google-io-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve known Android 12 was on its way for months, but<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/"> today was our first real look</a> at the next big change for the world&#8217;s most popular operating system. A new look, called Material You (yes), focuses on users, apps, and things like time of day or weather to change the UI&#8217;s colors and other aspects dynamically. Some security features like new camera and microphone use indicators are coming, as well as some &#8220;private compute core&#8221; features that use AI processes on your phone to customize replies and notifications. There&#8217;s a beta out today for the adventurous!</p>
<h2>Wow, Android powers 3 billion devices now</h2>
<p>Subhed says it all (but read more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-now-powers-3b-devices/">here</a>). Up from 2 billion in 2017.</p>
<h2>Smart Canvas smushes Docs, productivity, and video calls together</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2153963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="676" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg 1292w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=768,507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-canvas.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Millions of people and businesses use Google&#8217;s suite of productivity and collaboration tools, but the company felt it would be better if they weren&#8217;t so isolated. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-interconnects-its-workspace-apps-adds-a-dozen-new-features/">Now with Smart Canvas</a> you can have a video call as you work on a shared doc together and bring in information and content from your Drive and elsewhere. Looks complicated, but potentially convenient.</p>
<h2>AI conversations get more conversational with LaMDA</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a little too easy to stump AIs if you go off script, asking something in a way that to you seems normal but to the language model is totally incomprehensible. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/googles-lamda-makes-conversations-with-ais-more-conversational/">Google&#8217;s LaMDA is a new natural language processing technique</a> that makes conversations with AI models more resilient to unusual or unexpected queries, making it more like a real person and less like a voice interface for a search function. They demonstrated it by showing conversations with anthropomorphized versions of Pluto and a paper airplane. And yes, it was exactly as weird as it sounds.</p>
<h2>Google built a futuristic 3D video calling booth</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most surprising things at the keynote had to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">Project Starline, a high-tech 3D video call setup</a> that uses Google&#8217;s previous research and Lytro DNA to show realistic 3D avatars of people on both sides of the system. It&#8217;s still experimental but looks very promising.</p>
<h2>Wear OS gets a revamp and lots of health-focused apps</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2154142" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154142" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2154142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Few people want to watch a movie on their smartwatch, but lots of people like to use it to track their steps, meditation, and other health-related practices. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/after-closing-fitbit-acquisition-google-is-going-big-with-wear-os/">Wear OS is getting a bunch of Fitbit DNA infused</a>, with integrated health tracking stuff and a lot of third party apps like Calm and Flo.</p>
<h2>Samsung and Google announce a unified smartwatch platform</h2>
<p>These two mobile giants have been fast friends in the phone world for years, but when it comes to wearables, they&#8217;ve remained rivals. In the face of Apple&#8217;s utter dominance in the smartwatch space, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/">the two have put aside their differences</a> and announced they&#8217;ll work on a &#8220;unified platform&#8221; so developers can make apps that work on both Tizen and Wear OS.</p>
<h2>And they&#8217;re working together on foldables too</h2>
<p>Apparently Google and Samsung realized that no one is going to buy foldable devices unless they do some really cool things, and that collaboration is the best way forward there. So the two companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-adds-foldable-focused-android-developer-updates/">will also be working together</a> to improve how folding screens interact with Android.</p>
<h2>Android TV hits 80 million devices and adds phone remote</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2153285" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153285" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="563" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153285" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The smart TV space is a competitive one, and after a few starts Google has really made it happen with Android TV, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-tv-os-reaches-80m-monthly-active-devices-adds-new-features/">announced had reached 80 million monthly active devices</a> — putting it, Roku, and Amazon (the latter two with around 50 million monthly active <em>accounts</em>) all in the same league. The company also showed off a powerful new phone-based remote app that will (among other things) make putting in passwords way better than using the d-pad on the clicker. Developers will be glad to hear there&#8217;s a new Google TV emulator and Firebase Test Lab will have Android TV support.</p>
<h2>Your Android phone is now (also) your car key</h2>
<p>Well, assuming you have a really new Android device with a UWB chip in it. Google is working with BMW first, and other automakers soon most likely, to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/with-android-12-google-will-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-car-key/">a new method for unlocking the car when you get near it</a>, or exchanging basic commands without the use of a fob or Bluetooth. Why not Bluetooth you ask? Well, Bluetooth is old. UWB is new.</p>
<h2>Vertex collects machine learning development tools in one place</h2>
<p>Google and its sibling companies are both leaders in AI research and popular platforms for others to do their own AI work. But its machine learning development tools have been a bit scattershot — useful but disconnected. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-cloud-launches-vertex-a-new-managed-machine-learning-platform/">Vertex is a new development platform for enterprise AI</a> that puts many of these tools in one place and integrates closely with optional services and standards.</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s a new generation of Google&#8217;s custom AI chips</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=1536,985 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Google does a lot of machine learning stuff. Like, a LOT a lot. So they are constantly working to make better, more efficient computing hardware to handle the massive processing load these AI systems create. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/">TPUv4 is the latest</a>, twice as fast as the old ones, and will soon be packaged into 4,096-strong pods. Why 4,096 and not an even 4,000? The same reason any other number exists in computing: powers of 2.</p>
<h2>And they&#8217;re powering some new Photos features including one that&#8217;s horrifying</h2>

<p>Google Photos is a great service, and the company is trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-photos-update-adds-new-memories-and-a-locked-folder-previews-cinematic-moments/">leverage the huge library of shots most users have</a> to find patterns like &#8220;selfies with the family on the couch&#8221; and &#8220;traveling with my lucky hat&#8221; as fun ways to dive back into the archives. Great! But they&#8217;re also taking two photos taken a second apart and having an AI hallucinate what comes between them, leading to a truly weird looking form of motion that shoots deep, deep into the uncanny valley, from which hopefully it shall never emerge.</p>
<h2>Forget your password? Googlebot to the rescue</h2>
<p>Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI makes a hair appointment for you&#8221; service Duplex didn&#8217;t exactly set the world on fire, but the company has found a new way to apply it. If you forget your password, Duplex will automatically<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/chrome-now-uses-duplex-to-fix-your-stolen-passwords/"> fill in your old password, pick a new one and let you copy it</a> before submitting it to the site, all by interacting with the website&#8217;s normal reset interface. It&#8217;s only going to work on Twitter and a handful of other sites via Chrome for now, but hey, if it happens to you a lot, maybe it&#8217;ll save you some trouble.</p>

<p>The aged among our readers may remember Froogle, Google&#8217;s ill-fated shopping interface. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Well, it&#8217;s back&#8230; kind of.</a> The plan is to include lots of product information, from price to star rating, availability and other info, right in the Google interface when you search for something. It sucks up this information from retail sites, including whether you have something in your cart there. How all this benefits anyone more than Google is hard to imagine, but naturally they&#8217;re positioning it as wins all around. Especially for new partner Shopify. (Me, I use DuckDuckGo.)</p>
<h2>Flutter cross-platform devkit gets an update</h2>
<p>A lot of developers have embraced Google&#8217;s Flutter cross-platform UI toolkit. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-updates-its-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit/">The latest version, announced today</a>, adds some safety settings, performance improvements, and workflow updates. There&#8217;s lots more coming, too.</p>
<h2>Firebase gets an update too</h2>
<p>Popular developer platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-updates-firebase-with-new-personalization-features-security-tools-and-more/">Firebase got a bunch of new and updated features as well</a>. Remote Config gets a nice update allowing developers to customize the app experience to individual user types, and App Check provides a basic level of security against external threats. There&#8217;s plenty here for devs to chew on.</p>
<h2>The next version of Android Studio is Arctic Fox</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2153337" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153337" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153337" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=1536,765 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The beta for the next version of Google&#8217;s Android Studio environment is coming soon, and it&#8217;s called Arctic Fox. It&#8217;s got a brand new UI building toolkit called Jetpack Compose, and a bunch of accessibility testing built in to help developers make their apps more accessible to people with disabilities. Connecting to devices to test on them should be way easier now too. Oh, and there&#8217;s going to be a version of Android Studio for Apple Silicon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google offered an update on its TV platform, Android OS, at its Google I/O developer event on Tuesday. The company said its Android TV OS now reaches over 80 million monthly active devices, including through its new experience Google TV for Chromecast, as well as other platforms like smart TVs. The company also previewed a series of upcoming features for Android TV OS, including a remote control feature for consumers and several developer updates around casting, emulators, and more.</p>
<p>The company repositioned Android TV OS last fall with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/">the introduction of the Google TV experience</a>. The new experience, which runs Android TV under the hood, now powers Chromecast with Google TV, smart TVs from Sony, and is coming soon to some TCL TVs. Over 80% of Android TV OS&#8217; growth came from the U.S., Google noted, when announcing its 80 million monthly active devices milestone during the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s milestone may seem to put Android TV OS is ahead of rivals like Roku and Amazon Fire TV, with <a href="https://www-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/press/2021/1Q21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">53.6 million </a> and <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-advertisers-can-now-reach-up-to-50m-monthly-active-users-on-fire-tv">50+ million monthly active accounts</a>, respectively. However, these are different measurements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Android TV OS figures are actually calculated by counting the number of devices that were actively used in a month &#8212; which means a user with multiple devices could have those devices counted separately, but a family with multiple people watching on one device would be counted once.</p>
<p>Roku and Amazon define monthly active users as &#8220;accounts&#8221; that have been active during the month. That means, even if that account streams on several different devices during the time period, it would only be counted once. If Roku or Amazon were to calculate active devices as Google is doing, their numbers would be higher.</p>
<p>In addition, Roku and Amazon Fire TV power both their respective company&#8217;s own device lineup and select TVs from partners, but Google&#8217;s Android TV OS also powers devices and services from TV and streaming device brand <a href="https://www.android.com/tv/">partners</a> as well as TV service <a href="https://www.android.com/tv/">providers</a>. That means this global number includes operator-tier and set-top boxes also powered by Android TV OS. It&#8217;s a different type of market.</p>
<p>Google today also announced it&#8217;s adding remote control features directly in Android, so users will be able to control their TV even when their existing remote goes missing. This feature, arriving later this year, will make it easier to type in usernames and passwords or search for longer titles, Google notes. It will work for all users of Android TV OS, including Google TV.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for those building Android TV experiences, the company announced a handful of new features coming soon. A Cast Connect feature will allow users to cast from their Chrome browser on their phone or tablet to an Android TV app. Stream Transfer and Stream Expansion will allow users to transfer media to other devices or play audio on multiple devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stream-Transfer.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also making its first Google TV Emulator available, running on Android 11, along with an Android 11 image with the traditional Android TV experience. And developers can now also use a remote that more closely mimics TV remotes directly within the Emulator.</p>
<p>Following developer requests, Firebase Test Lab is adding Android TV support, as well. Initially, Firebase Test Lab Virtual Devices will run the developer&#8217;s app in the cloud on Android TV emulators to scale a test across hundreds or thousands of virtual devices. Support for physical devices will come soon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153286" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153286" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153286" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg 1222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirebaseTestLab.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153286" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the Android 12 Beta 1 is being made available for TV on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/droid-tv/streaming-gaming/google-adt-3">its ADT-3 Developer Kit,</a> starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Düsseldorf-based proptech startup <a href="https://www.dabbel.eu">Dabbel</a> is using AI to drive energy efficiency savings in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s developed cloud-based self-learning building management software that plugs into the existing building management systems (BMS) &#8212; taking over control of heating and cooling systems in a way that&#8217;s more dynamic than legacy systems based on fixed set-point resets.</p>
<p>Dabbel says its AI considers factors such as building orientation and thermal insulation, and reviews calibration decisions every five minutes &#8212; meaning it can respond dynamically to changes in outdoor and indoor conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 2018-founded startup claims this approach of layering AI-powered predictive modelling atop legacy BMS to power next-gen building automation is able to generate substantial energy savings &#8212; touting reductions in energy consumption of up to 40%.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every five minutes Dabbel reviews its decisions based on all available data,&#8221; explains CEO and co-founder, Abel Samaniego. &#8220;With each iteration, Dabbel improves or adapts and changes its decisions based on the current circumstances inside and outside the building. It does this by using cognitive artificial intelligence to drive a Model-Based Predictive Control (MPC) System&#8230; which can dynamically adjust all HVAC setpoints based on current/future conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the self-learning system predicts ahead of time the tweaks that are needed to adapt for future conditions &#8212; saving energy vs a pre-set BMS that would keep firing the boilers for longer.</p>
<p>The added carrot for commercial building owners (or tenants) is that Dabbel squeezes these energy savings without the need to rip and replace legacy systems &#8212; nor, indeed, to install lots of IoT devices or sensor hardware to create a &#8216;smart&#8217; interior environment; the AI integrates with (and automatically calibrates) the existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s needed is Dabbel&#8217;s SaaS &#8212; and less than a week for the system to be implemented (it also says installation can be done remotely).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no limitations in terms of Heating and Cooling systems,&#8221; confirms Samaniego, who has a background in industrial engineering and several years&#8217; experience automating high tech plants in Germany. &#8220;We need a building with a Building Management System in place and ideally a BACnet communication protocol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Average reductions achieved so far across the circa 250,000m² of space where its AI is in charge of building management systems are a little more modest but a still impressive 27%. (He says the maximum savings seen at some &#8220;peak times&#8221; is 42%.)</p>
<p>The touted savings aren&#8217;t limited to a single location or type of building/client, according to Dabbel, which says they&#8217;ve been &#8220;validated across different use cases and geographies spanning Europe, the U.S., China, and Australia&#8221;.</p>
<p>Early clients are facility managers of large commercial buildings &#8212; Commerzbank clearly sees potential, having incubated the startup via its early-stage investment arm &#8212; and several schools.</p>
<p>A further 1,000,000m² is in the contract or offer phase &#8212; slated to be installed &#8220;in the next six months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dabbel envisages its tech being useful to other types of education institutions and even other use-cases. (It&#8217;s also toying with adding a predictive maintenance functionality to expand its software&#8217;s utility by offering the ability to alert building owners to potential malfunctions ahead of time.)</p>
<p>And as policymakers around the global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/">turn their attention</a> to how to achieve the very major reductions in carbon emissions that are needed to meet ambitious climate goals the energy efficiency of buildings certainly can&#8217;t be overlooked.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IGIW5dZoPg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/">Startups have about $1 trillion worth of reasons to love the Biden infrastructure plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups have about $1 trillion worth of reasons to love the Biden infrastructure plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/embed/#?secret=IGIW5dZoPg" data-secret="IGIW5dZoPg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The time for passive responses to addressing the critical issue of carbon emission reduction is over,&#8221; said Samaniego in a statement. &#8220;That is why we decided to take matters into our own hands and develop a solution that actively replaces a flawed human-based decision-making process with an autonomous one that acts with surgical precision and thanks to artificial intelligence, will only improve with each iteration.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the idea of hooking your building&#8217;s heating/cooling up to a cloud-based AI sounds a tad risky for Internet security reasons, Dabbel points out it&#8217;s connecting to the BMS network &#8212; not the (separate) IT network of the company/building.</p>
<p>It also notes that it uses one-way communication via a VPN tunnel &#8212; &#8220;creating an end-to-end encrypted connection under high market standards&#8221;, as Samaniego puts it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup has just closed a €3.6 million (~$4.4M) pre-Series A funding round led by Target Global, alongside <a href="https://main-incubator.com/en/home/">main incubator</a> (Commerzbank’s early-stage investment arm), SeedX, plus some strategic angel investors.</span></p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Dr. Ricardo Schaefer, partner at Target Global, added: “We are enthusiastic to work with the team at Dabbel as they offer their clients a tangible and frictionless way to significantly reduce their carbon footprint, helping to close the gap between passive measurement and active remediation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a lot of how-to guidance out there when it comes to starting a company, and much of it has reinforced certain beliefs, including that solo founders don&#8217;t get very far on their own, that the most successful founders attend a small circle of top schools and that the best companies are created by people who launched them to solve a personal problem into which they had a particular insight.</p>
<p>Ali Tamaseb &#8212; who studied biomedical engineering at Imperial College London, attended business school at Stanford and founded a wearable tech startup before joining the venture firm DCVC as an investor in 2018 &#8212; says that lot of that guidance is, well, misguided. Tamaseb says he knows this because over the past four years, to improve his own decision-making, he amassed more than 30,000 data points about so-called &#8220;super founders,&#8221; from their age when their breakout company was founded to how many competitors they faced from the outset; in doing so, he says, he wound up discovering that much of what is espoused in startup circles is off the mark.</p>
<p>To share some of those learnings, Tamaseb has written a newly published  book called &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Founders-Reveals-Billion-Dollar-Startups/dp/1541768426">Super Founders: What Data Reveals About Billion-Dollar Startups</a>.&#8221; We talked with him yesterday. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: Why write this book?</strong></p>
<p>AT: When I was a founder, a lot of my perception was shaped through this lens of what the media tells us. Even now, when I&#8217;m on Twitter or Clubhouse, a lot of what I hear feels very different compared with what I see as a venture capitalist. Of course, nobody knows everything, and even the most successful venture capitalists have maybe invested in 10 of these breakout companies in their lifetime. So to get to the ground truth, and because nobody has collected this data because it&#8217;s hard, over four years of weekends and evenings, I began to collect [it], ultimately establishing 65 data points per company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are some of these data points and how much of them were publicly available?</strong></p>
<p>AT: The data includes the career path of the founder and whether their earlier roles were technical or not; the founder&#8217;s education and degree and the school they attended; what the market looked like when their company was started, including what the defensibility factors were; how many competitors they had; their fundraising history &#8212; how much did they raise and when and from whom?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bit of this data in a PitchBook or Crunchbase, but nobody had put [these other pieces] into [context]. I was going to their LinkedIn profiles, reading interviews, going to the internet&#8217;s Wayback Machine and other archives to read reports to understand what these companies looked like at the time they were founded. I also called a lot of these founders to ask them for answers where I couldn&#8217;t find the information. It was a very manual thing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many founders did you research?</strong></p>
<p>AT: I researched more than 200 unicorns, [launched by] around 500 founders. Because no study has meaning unless you also collect data on a control group, I selected companies that over the same time period had raised a minimum of $3 million in venture capital as my baseline group. I then compared the two groups based on these 65 different elements.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your research led you to invest in the primary and urgent care company Carbon Health on behalf of DCVC. How so?</strong></p>
<p>AT: Specifically here, founder Eren Bali had built a bunch of companies before, and a bunch had failed or succeeded on a smaller level, then his last company was [the edtech giant] Udemy, where he spent four years.</p>
<p>One of the key things that I observed in the data is that it&#8217;s all about these small steps &#8212; and the small or neutral exits. Around 60% of these &#8220;super founders&#8221; started something earlier, and many actually lost a bunch of money; just 42% of them had a previous exit of $10 million or more, so the majority had &#8220;failed&#8221; in the world of venture capital. But [the data suggests that] practice makes perfect.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also found that solo founders aren&#8217;t doomed to run smaller companies, despite some earlier thinking by Y Combinator&#8217;s Paul Graham that you need at least two co-founders to do something big.</strong></p>
<p>AT: Right, 20% of the founders in both groups &#8212; the unicorn and non-unicorn group &#8212; were solo founders, so VCs are funding solo founders and they are building billion-dollar companies. Basically, one out of every five unicorn companies has a solo founder. So I think that&#8217;s another narrative that gets retold, including on Twitter, but that doesn&#8217;t match reality. Flexport, for example, has a solo founder [in Ryan Petersen]. So does CarGurus, which was founded by Langley Steinert, who, by the way, first co-founded TripAdvisor [and more recently founded ApartmentAdvisor].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your book also asserts that there are plenty of founders of billion-dollar companies that didn&#8217;t attend elite American universities.</strong></p>
<p>AT: There are schools that founders attended more than others &#8212; Stanford, MIT, Wharton and Harvard &#8212; but as many of these founders attended schools that aren&#8217;t even at the top 100 [ranked U.S. schools] compared to those who went into the top 10. It&#8217;s a barbell distribution. Around 36% went to the top 10 schools, the same percentage went to schools not in the top 100, and there&#8217;s another 30% or so in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Two other observations in the book that are interesting are that half the founding CEOs you researched were non-technical, and only 30% had domain expertise in the industry they were disrupting. The latter may surprise readers particularly.</strong></p>
<p>AT: Yes, 30% of founders in consumer tech and 40% in enterprise tech did not come from the same domain [that their company now operates in]. And I see the same thing in startups that are just now getting funded. What it tells you is that domain expertise is not necessarily correlated to success.</p>

<p>Take Nat Turner of Flatiron Health [a cancer-focused startup that sold to Roche Group in 2018]. These guys were serial entrepreneurs and they had a bunch of successes before, and they jumped from one industry to another, starting with a pizza delivery company they started in college, where they learned about the restaurant industry and deliveries and logistics. They also sold an ad tech company to Google. Then they go and start this company in the cancer oncology IP and data space, where they didn&#8217;t know anything, but they learned as much as anybody after spending two years going and talking with every oncologist they could find in New York to understand the space. So maybe founders apply their tech background to different industries or they apply soft skills like resources and connections to learn about a specific industry rather than coming from that industry.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What did your research tell you about funding and its impacts? We&#8217;re seeing companies raise bigger rounds faster than ever before, including from Tiger Global.  </strong></p>
<p>AT: I don&#8217;t specifically have any brilliant thoughts on Tiger or anyone else, but these unicorns that I studied &#8212; even in their seed round and Series A rounds, they had raised two to three times larger rounds than the companies that did not become billion-dollar companies. In fact, 92% of these billion-dollar companies were venture-backed and they raised a lot of money, which allowed them to attract better talent and go to market faster. Even from the early stage, this kingmaker strategy kind of works.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This afternoon, we're parsing the WalkMe IPO filing, the second Israel-based tech company to file to go public this week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hot off the heels of our look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">into Marqeta&#8217;s IPO filing</a> and dives into SPACs for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/"> Bright Machines</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">Bird</a>, we&#8217;re parsing the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001847584/000119312521163950/d143770df1.htm">WalkMe IPO filing</a>. Later this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">Squarespace will direct list</a> and we&#8217;ll see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/as-procore-looks-to-nearly-double-its-private-valuation-the-ipo-market-shows-signs-of-life/">IPOs from Oatly and Procore</a>. It&#8217;s a super busy time for public debuts of all sorts.</p>
<p>Given how hectic the IPO market is, we&#8217;re going to skip our usual throat clearing and dig into WalkMe&#8217;s IPO document. As always, we&#8217;ll start with a brief overview of its product and then move into discussing its financial performance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153942" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153942" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153942 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meme.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meme.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meme.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meme.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meme.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153942" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Wilhelm</p></div></p>
<p>WalkMe is the second Israel-based technology company to file to go public <em>this week: </em>No-code startup Monday.com is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/">also pursuing an American IPO</a>.</p>
<p>Alright! Into the breach.</p>
<h2>What does WalkMe do?</h2>
<p>WalkMe&#8217;s software provides visual overlays on websites that help users navigate the product in question. I base that explanation on my time at Crunchbase, which was a customer during at least part of my time there. WalkMe is popular with marketing teams who want to introduce users to a new or refreshed experience.</p>
<p>Per the company&#8217;s F-1 filing, other elements of its service that matter include its onboarding system and what WalkMe calls Workstation, or its &#8220;single interface to the applications within an enterprise and simplifies task completion through a natural language conversational interface and automation.&#8221; We&#8217;re including that last feature because it says &#8220;automation,&#8221; which, in the wake of the UiPath IPO, is a word worth watching. Investors are.</p>
<p>At a high level, WalkMe is a SaaS business, which means that when we digest its results we are digging into a modern software company. Let&#8217;s do just that.</p>
<h2>WalkMe&#8217;s numbers</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, WalkMe grew its revenues from $105.1 million to $148.3 million, a gain of 41%. In its most recent quarter, the company&#8217;s growth rate slowed: From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, WalkMe&#8217;s top line grew 25% from $34.2 million to $42.7 million.</p>
<p>In SaaS terms, WalkMe calculates that its annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew from $131.2 million at the end of 2019 to $164.3 million in 2020. In more granular terms, the company&#8217;s ARR grew from $137.8 million to $177.5 million in the first quarters of 2020, and 2021, respectively.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the Instagram ads feel like they’re closing in and you can’t bring yourself to toggle your Zoom camera on these days, you’re far from alone. Well into 2021, many of the social apps and virtual chat tools that kept the world connected during the pandemic feel more exhausting than the real-life interactions they’re meant to simulate.</p>
<p>But what if hanging out online was… not miserable?</p>
<p>That’s the idea behind <a href="https://skittish.com/">Skittish</a>, a virtual browser-based event platform from<a href="https://xoxofest.com/"> XOXO co-founder Andy Baio</a>. Skittish is a playful cross between a social audio chat app like Discord or Clubhouse and a cute video game, replete with round, colorful animal avatars to choose from. Unlike a Zoom call, Skittish is a <em>place</em> — one where its inhabitants can bump into one another, do activities together and wait for serendipity to strike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Skittish is a natural extension of Baio’s interests, a sort of inviting, lightly indie-gamified space where creative people can showcase their work and hang out. “I think I&#8217;m just drawn to places where people can be themselves,” Baio told TechCrunch. “With Skittish, it&#8217;s been really important to me that people can engage at the level they&#8217;re comfortable with.”</p>
<p>Baio has a reputation for curating special social spaces, though until Skittish they were mostly IRL. In 2012, Baio co-created XOXO, a whimsical Portland-based festival for quirky people who make stuff. While the <a href="https://xoxofest.com/blog/2020-xoxo-2020-is-canceled">festival took a few years off due to Covid</a>, the event lives on in a bustling online community full of indie game devs, offbeat podcasters and digital artists. Prior to XOXO, Baio worked on Kickstarter pre-launch and went on to serve as the crowdfunding site’s first chief technology officer. (Full disclosure: I’m a former XOXO attendee who is part of the community.)</p>
<p>The aptly named Skittish is meant to create an online social space that doesn’t put people on the spot. In Baio’s ideal virtual world, introverts could circle the periphery while extroverts could plunge right in and hold court at the center, just like they might in real life. That range of social styles that isn’t reflected in virtual environments that are either explicitly for work or modeled after work and it’s enough to inspire dread for a lot of people.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-HbyOS3mz18?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For Baio, audio chat hits a sweet spot. Taking the camera out of the equation makes people feel socially fluid, but audio still evokes a degree of social presence that text can’t compete with.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s an assumption in a lot of virtual events that people want to be on camera all the time with strangers, which feels alien to me,” Baio said. “Skittish is audio by default, and uses spatial audio so that you can hear people around you and lurk a little bit before deciding if you want to jump into a conversation. Socializing anywhere, even online, can be really anxiety-inducing.”</p>
<p>Clubhouse might be synonymous with social audio right now, but its structure still doesn’t appeal to everyone. “I like the casual and conversational approach to audio, but [it] just feels like a series of conference panels and needs a strong moderator to be compelling enough to tune in,” Baio said.</p>

<h3>How Skittish works</h3>
<p>In Skittish, walking up to a group of people (animals, really — Skittish users can differentiate themselves by choosing one of more than 75 deeply cute animal avatars) allows you to hear a conversation just like you would in real life. Backing away, you’d hear that chatter fade until eventually it wouldn’t be audible any more. To have a more private side conversation, you and a friend (a crocodile, maybe?) could peel off from a cluster of other people and deepen your chat on a virtual walk.</p>
<p>Inside a Skittish room, event participants can walk around, chat with others over a mic, place virtual objects and even hop through portals to other rooms. Anyone running a Skittish space can stream videos and music from YouTube or Soundcloud to a virtual screen. Event organizers can also broadcast themselves or other speakers to the full room, overriding the normal proximity rules that let you hear what’s around you.</p>

<p>Baio doesn&#8217;t imagine Skittish as a persistent social space, but instead wants it to provide a flexible, playful platform for all kinds of events, everything from live podcast readings and tabletop games to larger company events. Baio says the core target audience for Skittish is “anybody with a Patreon,” and larger company events will offset costs for creators who use Skittish to connect with their communities. Anyone hosting an event can choose to either populate a virtual space with pre-designed virtual objects (think pirate ships and giant doughnuts) or dream up their own environment from scratch.</p>
<p>By designing a service that only exists when people need it, he hopes to avoid the harassment and toxicity that abounds on big social networks. Skittish will still pack a set of tools that allow a space’s creator to mute, kick or even ban users, but ideally, it won’t need it.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m a big fan of dark social, in general, where people can feel more like themselves and moderation is much more human and manageable,” Baio said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-2154179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png" alt="Skittish mod tools (mute, kick, ban buttons)" width="950" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png 950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/skittish-mod-tools.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<h3>Building Skittish and what’s next</h3>
<p>The pandemic shed new light on what people really want out of online social spaces. Zoom’s novelty wore off quickly, and by late 2020 group video chat felt like an entrenched fixture of virtual work, not virtual play. It shouldn’t be surprising that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/animal-crossing/">gentle social simulator with light multiplayer features</a> emerged as the game of 2020.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a bit of a cliché, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons became a reliable escape for me during the pandemic, a daily source of comfort and routine when we couldn&#8217;t go outside,” Baio said. He was charmed by his first foray into the series’ famously soothing rhythms and the game helped him envision Skittish.</p>
<p>“&#8230; I think what inspired me most were the simplicity of the controls and camera, the overall tone of the game, and the social features, limited as they are,” Baio said. “You&#8217;re capped at seven visitors and it takes forever for people to fly in, but despite that, it&#8217;s just a joyful experience to have a bunch of people over to your island.”</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch sold out everywhere and Animal Crossing racing up the console’s all-time sales charts, it was obvious early on that something resonated. People who wouldn’t normally consider themselves gamers bought Switches and spent hours shaking virtual trees, chatting with squirrels and touring friends’ islands for interior design tips. With Skittish, Baio hopes to capture a little of that same magic.</p>
<p>Games that double as social networks are booming right now — and with good reason. For many people it’s more natural to socialize when you’re ambiently doing something else together, whether that’s teaming up for a Fortnite duo, building a viking longhouse in Valheim or sampling user-built games within Roblox.</p>
<p>Socializing online with avatars also lets you express yourself in a meaningful enough way that Epic built an entire business around it, with sales of skins (virtual outfits) and emotes (dance moves and gestures) making up the lion’s share of Fortnite revenue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-2154210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png" alt="Skittish - Asset Editor" width="1384" height="946" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png 1384w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Skittish-Asset-Editor.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1384px) 100vw, 1384px" /></p>
<p>Skittish grew out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/100m-grant-for-the-web-fund-aims-to-jump-start-a-new-way-to-pay-online/">a $100,000 grant awarded by Grant For The Web</a>, a fund created by Coil, Mozilla and Creative Commons to support projects that incorporate micropayments for online creators. Baio began prototyping Skittish last July, imagining it as a pop-up space for events rather than a persistent virtual world.</p>
<p>Skittish spaces initially accommodated up to 120 mixed voices in a single room, but the audio capacity is even higher now. Though he’s still testing what the new limits might be, Skittish is getting closer to Baio’s goal of hosting 1000-person events. Skittish rooms can now be password protected, invite-only or public, and Baio imagines special “cozy” 3-5 person spaces in the project&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>For its high quality spatial audio chat, <a href="https://www.highfidelity.com/">Skittish uses an API from High Fidelity</a>, the latest project from Second Life creator Philip Rosedale. Amazingly, Second Life <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna17389286">added spatial audio to its online worlds all the way back in 2007</a> — <em>fourteen years ago</em>.</p>
<p>Skittish will host its first paid events this month as a test, with invites to follow after that. Baio plans to rely on paid events for revenue and he’s on the fence about offering a free tier due to moderation concerns and the costs associated with hosting hundreds of simultaneous conversations between virtual elephants, zebras and raccoons.</p>

<h3>A walk in Skittish</h3>
<p>I met up with Baio in Skittish to chat about the project and it immediately felt less awkward than a Zoom call or Google Hangout. As a noble trash panda, I followed Baio’s owl around the colorful polygonal virtual set like we might have walked around a park having coffee together.</p>
<p>Skittish looks like a video game and you can move around using WASD if you want, but it’s straightforward enough that anyone can get the hang of it right away. The world&#8217;s simple graphical style sets a chill, creative vibe and the avatars even have a gentle idle animation, a kind of bounce that brings your respective elephant, raccoon or zebra to life.</p>
<p>Like experiences I&#8217;ve had in a few other innovative avatar-based virtual worlds (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/altspace-vr-virtual-reality-social-platform/">AltspaceVR comes to mind</a>), the sense of really being there, just hanging out, feels revelatory. Multiplayer games have been miles ahead of traditional social networks on this phenomenon for ages; it&#8217;s no wonder that Fortnite and Minecraft are de facto social networks for a huge swath of younger people. In Skittish, the high quality spatial audio and playful sense of presence offer something similarly transporting.</p>
<p>Virtual owls aside, Baio says says Skittish will be a success when people start forging connections there that follow them well beyond the virtual world. “Just like the events I&#8217;ve run in real life, I&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s working when I hear stories about people meeting each other in a playful environment and making new friends.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its <a href="https://events.google.com/io/?lng=en">I/O developer conference</a>, Google today announced a slew of updates to its Firebase developer platform, which, as the company also announced, now powers over 3 million apps.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a number of major updates here, most of which center around improving existing tools like Firebase Remote Config and Firebase&#8217;s monitoring capabilities, but there are also a number of completely new features here as well, including the ability to create Android App Bundles and a new security tool called <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check">App Check</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helping developers be successful is what makes Firebase successful,&#8221; Firebase product manager Kristen Richards told me ahead of today&#8217;s announcements. &#8220;So we put helpfulness and helping developers at the center of everything that we do.&#8221; She noted that during the pandemic, Google saw a lot of people who started to focus on app development &#8212; both as learners and as professional developers. But the team also saw a lot of enterprises move to its platform as those companies looked to quickly bring new apps online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maybe the marquee Firebase announcement at I/O is the updated Remote Config. That&#8217;s always been a very powerful feature that allows developers to make changes to live production apps on the go without having to release a new version of their app. Developers can use this for anything from A/B testing to providing tailored in-app experience to specific user groups.</p>
<p>With this update, Google is introducing updates to the Remote Config console, to make it easier for developers to see how they are using this tool, as well as an updated publish flow and redesigned test results pages for A/B tests.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153020" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153020" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153020" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png" alt="" width="980" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png 980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/firebase_ab_testing.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153020" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s most important, though, is that Google is taking Remote Config a step further now by launching a new Personalization feature that helps developers automatically optimize the user experience for individual users. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new feature of [Remote Config] that uses Google&#8217;s machine learning to create unique individual app experiences,&#8221; Richards explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s super simple to set up and it automatically creates these personalized experiences that&#8217;s tailored to each individual user. Maybe you have something that you would like, which would be something different for me. In that way, we&#8217;re able to get a tailored experience, which is really what customers expect nowadays. I think we&#8217;re all expecting things to be more personalized than they have in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153025" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153025" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png 1156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-102729.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also improving a number of Firebase&#8217;s analytics and monitoring capabilities, including its Crashlytics service for figuring out app crashes. For game developers, that means improved support for games written with the help of the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity platform</a>, for example, but for all developers, the fact that Firebase&#8217;s Performance Monitoring service now processes data in real time is a major update to having performance data (especially on launch day) arrive with a delay of almost half a day.</p>
<p>Firebase is also now finally adding support for <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle">Android App Bundles</a>, Google&#8217;s relatively new format for packaging up all of an app&#8217;s code and resources, with Google Play optimizing the actual APK with the right resources for the kind of device the app gets installed on. This typically leads to smaller downloads and faster installs.</p>
<p>On the security side, the Firebase team is launching App Check, now available in beta. App Check helps developers guard their apps against outside threats and is meant to automatically block any traffic to online resources like Cloud Storage, Realtime Database and Cloud Functions for Firebase (with others coming soon) that doesn&#8217;t provide valid credentials.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153049" style="width: 958px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153049" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153049" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png" alt="" width="948" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png 948w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png?resize=768,334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png?resize=680,296 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-17-103633.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153049" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The other update worth mentioning here is to Firebase Extensions, which launched a while ago, but which is getting support for a few more extensions today. These are new extensions from Algolia, Mailchimp and MessageBird, that helps bring new features like Algolia&#8217;s search capabilities or MessageBird&#8217;s communications features directly to the platform.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Google I/O today Google Cloud announced Vertex AI, a new managed machine learning platform that is meant to make it easier for developers to deploy and maintain their AI models. It&#8217;s a bit of an odd announcement at I/O, which tends to focus on mobile and web developers and doesn&#8217;t traditionally feature a lot of Google Cloud news, but the fact that Google decided to announce Vertex today goes to show how important it thinks this new service is for a wide range of developers.</p>
<p>The launch of Vertex is the result of quite a bit of introspection by the Google Cloud team. &#8220;Machine learning in the enterprise is in crisis, in my view,&#8221; Craig Wiley, the director of product management for Google Cloud&#8217;s AI Platform, told me. &#8220;As someone who has worked in that space for a number of years, if you look at the Harvard Business Review or analyst reviews, or what have you &#8212; every single one of them comes out saying that the vast majority of companies are either investing or are interested in investing in machine learning and are <em>not</em> getting value from it. That has to change. It has to change.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153838" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153838" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-in-the-details.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153838" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wiley, who was also the general manager of AWS&#8217;s SageMaker AI service from 2016 to 2018 before coming to Google in 2019, noted that Google and others who were able to make machine learning work for themselves saw how it can have a transformational impact, but he also noted that the way the big clouds started offering these services was by launching dozens of services, &#8220;many of which were dead ends,&#8221; according to him (including some of Google&#8217;s own). &#8220;Ultimately, our goal with Vertex is to reduce the time to ROI for these enterprises, to make sure that they can not just build a model but get real value from the models they&#8217;re building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vertex then is meant to be a very flexible platform that allows developers and data scientist across skill levels to quickly train models. Google says it takes about 80% fewer lines of code to train a model versus some of its competitors, for example, and then help them manage the entire lifecycle of these models.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153839" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153839" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2153839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png 513w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VertexAI-512-color.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The service is also integrated with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/optimizer/docs/overview">Vizier</a>, Google&#8217;s AI optimizer that can automatically tune hyperparameters in machine learning models. This greatly reduces the time it takes to tune a model and allows engineers to run more experiments and do so faster.</p>
<p>Vertex also offers a &#8220;Feature Store&#8221; that helps its users serve, share and reuse the machine learning features and Vertex Experiments to help them accelerate the deployment of their models into producing with faster model selection.</p>
<p>Deployment is backed by a continuous monitoring service and Vertex Pipelines, a rebrand of Google Cloud&#8217;s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs">AI Platform Pipelines</a> that helps teams manage the workflows involved in preparing and analyzing data for the models, train them, evaluate them and deploy them to production.</p>

<p>To give a wide variety of developers the right entry points, the service provides three interfaces: a drag-and-drop tool, notebooks for advanced users and &#8212; and this may be a bit of a surprise &#8212; <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction">BigQuery ML</a>, Google&#8217;s tool for using standard SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in its BigQuery data warehouse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Things have been a bit quiet on the foldables front of late, but plenty of parties are still bullish about the form factor’s future. Ahead of today’s big I/O kickoff, Samsung (undoubtedly the most bullish of the bunch) <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/how-samsung-foldables-changing-way-use-smartphones-google/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;utm_medium=email">posted a bunch of metrics this morning</a>, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The global outlook is just as impressive. This year alone, the foldables market is expected to triple over last year — a year in which Samsung accounted for three out of every four foldable smartphones shipped worldwide.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google is adding Android support for foldable screens&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/google-is-adding-android-support-for-foldable-screens/embed/#?secret=xxnD7tF0RQ" data-secret="xxnD7tF0RQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of anticipating growth in the category is ensuring that the software is ready. Samsung has been tweaking things for a while now on its end, and at I/O in 2018, Google announced it would be adding support for foldable screens. Recent rumors have suggested that the company is working on its own foldable Pixel, but even beyond that, it’s probably in the company’s best interest to ensure that Android plays nicely with the form factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We studied how people interact with large screens,&#8221; the company said in today&#8217;s developer keynote. This includes a variety of different aspects, including where users place their hands while using the device &#8212; which can be a bit all over the place when dealing with different applications in different orientations and form factors. Essentially, you don&#8217;t want to, say, put buttons where people generally place your hands.</p>
<p>The list of upgrades includes the ability to resize content automatically, without overly stretching it out to fit multiple panels. All of this is no doubt going to be a learning curve as foldables end up in the hands of more users. But at the very least, it signals Google&#8217;s continued view of foldables as a growing category. It&#8217;s also one of multiple updates today that involve the company working more closely with Samsung.</p>
<p>The two tech giants also announced a joint Wear OS/Tizen play earlier today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, Google&#8217;s cross-platform UI toolkit for building mobile and desktop apps, is getting a small but important update at the company&#8217;s I/O conference today. Google also announced that Flutter now powers 200,000 apps in the Play Store alone, including popular apps from companies like WeChat, ByteDance, BMW, Grab and DiDi. Indeed, Google notes that one in eight new apps in the Play Store are now Flutter apps.</p>
<p>The launch of Flutter 2.2 follows Google&#8217;s rollout of Flutter 2, which first added support for desktop and web apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/version-2-of-googles-flutter-toolkit-adds-support-for-desktop-and-web-apps/">in March</a>, so it&#8217;s no surprise that this is a relatively minor release. In many ways, the update builds on top of the features the company introduced in version 2 and its reliability and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Version 2.2 makes null safety the default for new projects, for example, to add protections against null reference exceptions. As for performance, web apps can now use background caching using service workers, for example, while Android apps can use deferred components and iOS apps get support for precompiled shaders to make first runs smoother.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google also worked on streamlining the overall process of bringing Flutter apps to desktop platforms (Windows, macOS and Linux).</p>
<p>But as Google notes, a lot of the work right now is happening in the ecosystem. Google itself is introducing a new payment plugin for Flutter built in partnership with the Google Pay team and Google&#8217;s ads SDK for Flutter is getting support for adaptive banner formats. Meanwhile, Samsung is now porting Flutter to Tizen and Sony is leading an effort to bring it to embedded Linux. Adobe recently announced its XD to Flutter plugin for its design tool and Microsoft today launched the alpha of Flutter support for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for Windows 10 in alpha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its I/O developer conference, Google today announced the first beta of the next version of its Android Studio IDE, Arctic Fox. For the most part, the idea here is to bring more of the tooling around building Android apps directly into the IDE.</p>
<p>While there is a lot that&#8217;s new in Arctic Fox, maybe the marquee feature of this update is the integration of <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose">Jetpack Compose</a>, Google&#8217;s toolkit for building modern user interfaces for Android. In Android Studio, developers can now use Compose Preview to create previews of different configurations (think themes and devices) or deploy a preview directly to a device, all while the layout inspector makes it easier for developers to understand how (and why) a layout is rendered the way it is. With Live Updates enabled, any change is then also directly streamed to the device.</p>
<p>The team also integrated the Android Accessibility Test Framework directly into Android Studio to help developers find accessibility issues like missing content descriptions or a low contrast in their designs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Just like with some of the updates to Android itself, the team is also looking at making it easier to develop for a wider range of form factors. To build Wear OS apps, developers previously had to physically connect the watch to their development machine or go through a lot of steps to pair the watch. Now, users can simply pair a watch and phone emulator (or physical phone) with the new Wear OS Pairing feature. All this takes now is a few clicks.</p>
<p>Also new on the Wear OS side is a new heart rate sensor for the Wear OS Emulators in Android Studio, while the Android Automotive emulator gains the ability to replay car sensor data to help those developers with their development and testing workflow.</p>
<p>Android Studio users who work on a Mac will be happy to hear that Google is also launching a first preview of Android Studio for the Apple Silicon (arm64) architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is working on a video calling booth that uses 3D imagery on a 3D display to create a lifelike image of the people on both sides. While it&#8217;s still experimental, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/">&#8220;Project Starline&#8221;</a> builds on years of research and acquisitions, and could be the core of a more personal-feeling video meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>The system was only shown via video of unsuspecting participants, who were asked to enter a room with a heavily obscured screen and camera setup. Then the screen lit up with a video feed of a loved one, but in a way none of them expected:</p>
<p>&#8220;I could feel her and see her, it was like this 3D experience. It was like she was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like I could really touch him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really, really felt like she and I were in the same room.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q13CishCKXY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>CEO Sundar Pichai explained that this &#8220;experience&#8221; was made possible with high-resolution cameras and custom depth sensors, almost certainly related to these Google research projects into essentially converting videos of people and locations into interactive 3D scenes:</p>

<p>The cameras and sensors — probably a dozen or more hidden around the display — capture the person from multiple angles and figure out their exact shape, creating a live 3D model of them. This model and all the color and lighting information is then (after a lot of compression and processing) sent to the other person&#8217;s setup, which shows it in convincing 3D. It even tracks their heads and bodies to adjust the image to their perspective. (There&#8217;s a bit more on an early version of the technique <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2020/08/how-google-is-making-streamable-light-field-video-a-reality.html/">here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-gif.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="455" /></a></p>
<p>But 3D TVs have more or less fallen by the wayside; turns out no one wants to wear special glasses for hours at a time, and the quality on glasses-free 3D was generally pretty bad. So what&#8217;s making this special 3D image?</p>
<p>Pichai said &#8220;We have developed a breakthrough light field display,&#8221; probably with the help of the people and IP it scooped up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/lytro-is-shutting-down/">Lytro, the light field camera company</a> that didn&#8217;t manage to get its own tech off the ground and dissolved in 2018.</p>
<p>Light field cameras and displays create and show 3D imagery using a variety of techniques that are very difficult to explain or show in 2D. The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/looking-glass-is-launching-3d-photo-software-for-its-holographic-tech/">Looking Glass</a> has made several that are extremely arresting to view in person, showing 3D models and photographic scenes that truly look like tiny holograms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Looking Glass is launching 3D photo software for its holographic tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/looking-glass-is-launching-3d-photo-software-for-its-holographic-tech/embed/#?secret=bwg8JyuAuX" data-secret="bwg8JyuAuX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Whether Google&#8217;s approach is similar or different, the effect appears to be equally impressive, as the participants indicate. They&#8217;ve been testing this internally and are getting ready to send out units to partners in various industries (such as medicine) where the feeling of a person&#8217;s presence makes a big difference.</p>
<p>At this point Project Starline is still very much a prototype, and probably a ridiculously expensive one — so don&#8217;t expect to get one in your home any time soon. But it&#8217;s not wild to think that a consumer version of this light field setup may be available down the line. Google promises to share more later this year.</p>
