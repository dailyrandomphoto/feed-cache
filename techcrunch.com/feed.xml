										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies try to navigate an ever-changing security landscape, it can be challenging to protect everything. Security startup <a href="https://truefort.com/">TrueFort </a>has built a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/">zero trust solution</a> focussing on protecting enterprise applications. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p>Shasta Ventures led today&#8217;s round with participation from new firms Canaan and Ericsson Ventures along with existing investors Evolution Equity Partners, Lytical Ventures and Emerald Development Managers. Under the terms of the agreement Nitin Chopra, managing director at Shasta Ventures will be joining the company board. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to almost $48 million.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Sameer Malhotra says that TrueFort protects customers by analyzing at each application and figuring out what normal behavior looks like. Once it understands that, it will flag anything that falls outside of the norm. The company achieves this by gathering data from partners like CrowdStrike and from multiple points within the application and infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we get this telemetry, whether it&#8217;s networks, endpoints, servers or third party partners, we then help the customer build a picture of what those applications are doing and what&#8217;s normal behavior. We then help them baseline that, and monitor that in real time with response and real time controls to continue those applications through their normal life cycle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zero trust is a concept where as a matter of policy you assume that you cannot trust any individual or device until the entity proves it belongs on your systems. Malhotra says that customers are becoming more comfortable with the concept and in 2020 the company saw massive 650% YoY revenue growth with it up 120% YoY this year so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing the demand, especially as zero trust is becoming a more familiar vernacular amongst the security community [&#8230;]. Again, it&#8217;s having the visibility and understanding, and then being able to then reduce it to the limited number of acceptable relationships or executions,&#8221; he said. And he believes that it all comes down to understanding your applications and how they operate.</p>

<p>The company currently has 60 employees with hopes of reaching 85 or 90 by the end of the year. Malhotra says that as they build the employee base, they are driving to make it diverse at every level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look at diversity across our whole management team, all the way from the board down to our different levels. We are quite aggressive in hiring diverse candidates, whether they&#8217;re women or LGBTQ or people of color. And we have focused programs where we work with different universities [&#8230;] to bring on new employees from a diverse talent pool. We also work with different recruiters from that perspective, and our focus is always to look at a different palette and to make sure that we&#8217;re as diverse an organization as we can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2015 by Malhotra and his partner Nazario Parsacala, both of whom spent more than 20 years working at big financial services companies &#8212; Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. They worked for a couple of years building the program, launching the first beta in 2017 before bringing the first generally available product to market the following year.</p>
<p>Currently customers can install the solution on prem or in the cloud of their choice, but the company has a SaaS solution in the works as well, that will be ready in the next couple of months.</p>

Chinese EV maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xpeng-p7-ev-183226796.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Xpeng</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpM_zX0Fe7U" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">teased</a> a robot unicorn meant for children to ride. As <em>SCMP</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3147903/xpengs-unveils-smart-robot-pony-children-taking-it-step-closer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">notes</a>, the quadruped will take advantage of Xpeng&#8217;s experiences with autonomous driving and other AI tasks to navigate multiple terrain types, recognize objects and provide &#8220;emotional interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is shy on most other details, although the design looks and trots like a cuter, more kid-friendly version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spot-boston-dynamics-commercial-sales-140018961.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Boston Robotics&#8217; Spot</a>. It&#8217;s appropriately about as tall as a child. Sorry, folks, you won&#8217;t prance your way to work.</p>
<p>This robot unicorn is just about as mythical as the &#8216;real&#8217; thing, too. Xpeng hasn&#8217;t revealed when it expects to deliver its robotic horse-with-a-horn, let alone pricing or availability. It might not cost as much as a $75,000 Spot, but we&#8217;d expect something this sophisticated to cost more than the $2,900 Aibo from 2019.</p>
<p>To some extent, profit is beside the point. Xpeng chief He Xiaopeng said the unicorn was part of a broader move into the robotics space by taking advantage of the company&#8217;s existing technology. Think of this as a first step. What Xpeng learns from its unicorn could lead to more sophisticated (and hopefully adult-oriented) robots you&#8217;re more likely to buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government is preparing to spend over half a million dollars to encourage the development of detection technologies for child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) that can be bolted on to end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms to scan for the illegal material, as part of its ongoing policy push around Internet and child safety.</p>
<p>In a joint initiative today, the Home Office and the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) <a href="https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2021/09/08/new-safety-tech-fund-challenge/">announced</a> a &#8220;Tech Safety Challenge Fund&#8221; &#8212; which will distribute up to £425,000 (~$584k) to five organizations (£85k/$117k each) to develop &#8220;innovative technology to keep children safe in environments such as online messaging platforms with end-to-end encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>A Challenge statement for applicants to the program adds that the focus is on solutions that can be deployed within e2e encrypted environments &#8220;without compromising user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem that we&#8217;re trying to fix is essentially the blindfolding of law enforcement agencies,&#8221; a Home Office spokeswoman told us, arguing that if tech platforms go ahead with their &#8220;full end-to-end encryption plans, as they currently are&#8230; we will be completely hindered in being able to protect our children online&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the announcement does not name any specific platforms of concern, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously attacked Facebook&#8217;s plans to expand its use of e2e encryption &#8212; warning in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56795852">April</a> that the move could jeopardize law enforcement&#8217;s ability to investigate child abuse crime.</p>
<p>Facebook-owned WhatsApp also already uses e2e encryption so that platform is already a clear target for whatever &#8216;safety&#8217; technologies might result from this taxpayer-funded challenge.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s iMessage and FaceTime are among other existing mainstream messaging tools which use e2e encryption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So there is potential for very widespread application of any &#8216;child safety tech&#8217; developed through this government-backed challenge. (Per the Home Office, technologies submitted to the Challenge will be evaluated by &#8220;independent academic experts&#8221;. The department was unable to provide details of who exactly will assess the projects.)</p>
<p>Patel, meanwhile, is continuing to apply high level pressure on the tech sector on this issue &#8212; including aiming to drum up support from G7 counterparts.</p>
<p>Writing in paywalled op-ed in Tory-friendly newspaper, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/09/08/priti-patel-call-worlds-tech-giants-please-dont-put-profit-safety/">The Telegraph</a>, she trails a meeting she&#8217;ll be chairing today where she says she&#8217;ll push the G7 to collectively pressure social media companies to do more to address &#8220;harmful content on their platforms&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The introduction of end-to-end encryption must not open the door to even greater levels of child sexual abuse. Hyperbolic accusations from some quarters that this is really about governments wanting to snoop and spy on innocent citizens are simply untrue. It is about keeping the most vulnerable among us safe and preventing truly evil crimes,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am calling on our international partners to back the UK’s approach of holding technology companies to account. They must not let harmful content continue to be posted on their platforms or neglect public safety when designing their products. We believe there are alternative solutions, and I know our law enforcement colleagues agree with us.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I am leading discussions with my G7 counterparts on how to keep our children safe online. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the op-ed, the Home Secretary singles out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">Apple&#8217;s recent move to add a CSAM detection tool</a> to iOS and macOS to scan content on user&#8217;s devices before it&#8217;s uploaded to iCloud &#8212; welcoming the development as a &#8220;first step&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple state their child sexual abuse filtering technology has a false positive rate of 1 in a trillion, meaning the privacy of legitimate users is protected whilst those building huge collections of extreme child sexual abuse material are caught out. They need to see th[r]ough that project,&#8221; she writes, urging Apple to press ahead with the (currently delayed) rollout.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">Last week</a> the iPhone maker said it would delay implementing the CSAM detection system &#8212; following a backlash led by security experts and privacy advocates who raised concerns about vulnerabilities in its approach, as well as the contradiction of a &#8216;privacy-focused&#8217; company carrying out on-device scanning of customer data. They also flagged the wider risk of the scanning infrastructure being seized upon by governments and states who might order Apple to scan for other types of content, not just CSAM.</p>
<p>Patel&#8217;s description of Apple&#8217;s move as just a &#8220;first step&#8221; is unlikely to do anything to assuage concerns that once such scanning infrastructure is baked into e2e encrypted systems it will become a target for governments to widen the scope of what commercial platforms must legally scan for.</p>
<p>However the Home Office&#8217;s spokeswoman told us that Patel&#8217;s comments on Apple&#8217;s CSAM tech were only intended to welcome its decision to take action in the area of child safety &#8212; rather than being an endorsement of any specific technology or approach. (And Patel does also write: &#8220;But that is just one solution, by one company. Greater investment is essential.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The Home Office spokeswoman wouldn&#8217;t comment on which types of technologies the government is aiming to support via the Challenge fund, either, saying only that they&#8217;re looking for a range of solutions.</p>
<p>She told us the overarching goal is to support &#8216;middleground&#8217; solutions &#8212; denying the government is trying to encourage technologists to come up with ways to backdoor e2e encryption.</p>
<p>In recent years in the UK GCHQ has also floated the controversial idea of a so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/apple-google-microsoft-whatsapp-sign-open-letter-condemning-gchq-proposal-to-listen-in-on-encrypted-chats/">&#8216;ghost protocol&#8217;</a> &#8212; that would allow for state intelligence or law enforcement agencies to be invisibly CC’d by service providers into encrypted communications on a targeted basis. That proposal was met with widespread criticism, including from the tech industry, which warned it would undermine trust and security and threaten fundamental rights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if the government has such an approach &#8212; albeit with a CSAM focus &#8212; in mind here now as it tries to encourage the development of &#8216;middleground&#8217; technologies that are able to scan e2e encrypted content for specifically illegal stuff.</p>
<p>In another concerning development, earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">this summer</a>, guidance put out by DCMS for messaging platforms recommended that they &#8220;prevent&#8221; the use of e2e encryption for child accounts altogether.</p>
<p>Asked about that, the Home Office spokeswoman told us the tech fund is &#8220;not too different&#8221; and &#8220;is trying to find the solution in between&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working together and bringing academics and NGOs into the field so that we can find a solution that works for both what social media companies want to achieve and also make sure that we&#8217;re able to protect children,&#8221; said said, adding: &#8220;We need everybody to come together and look at what they can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is not much more clarity in the Home Office <a href="https://view.publitas.com/public-1/safety-tech-challenge-fund-supplier-guidance/page/2-3">guidance</a> to suppliers applying for the chance to bag a tranche of funding.</p>
<p>There it writes that proposals must &#8220;make innovative use of technology to enable more effective detection and/or prevention of sexually explicit images or videos of children&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within scope are tools which can identify, block or report either new or previously known child sexual abuse material, based on AI, hash-based detection or other techniques,&#8221; it goes on, further noting that proposals need to address &#8220;the specific challenges posed by e2ee environments, considering the opportunities to respond at different levels of the technical stack (including client-side and server-side).&#8221;</p>
<p>General information about the Challenge &#8212; which is open to applicants based anywhere, not just in the UK &#8212; can be found on the Safety Tech Network <a href="https://www.safetytechnetwork.org.uk/innovation-challenges/safety-tech-challenge-fund">website</a>.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is October 6.</p>
<p>Selected applicants will have five months, between November 2021 and March 2022 to deliver their projects.</p>
<p>When exactly any of the tech might be pushed at the commercial sector isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; but the government may be hoping that by keeping up the pressure on the tech sector platform giants will develop this stuff themselves, as Apple has been.</p>
<p>The Challenge is just the latest UK government initiative to bring platforms in line with its policy priorities &#8212; back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/uk-wants-tech-firms-to-build-tools-to-block-terrorist-content/">2017</a>, for example, it was pushing them to build tools to block terrorist content &#8212; and you could argue it&#8217;s a form of progress that ministers are not simply calling for e2e encryption to be outlawed, as they frequently have in the past.</p>
<p>That said, talk of &#8216;preventing&#8217; the use of e2e encryption &#8212; or even fuzzy suggestions of &#8220;in between&#8221; solutions &#8212; may not end up being so very different.</p>
<p>What is different is the sustained focus on child safety as the political cudgel to make platforms comply. That seems to be getting results.</p>
<p>Wider government plans to regulate platforms &#8212; set out in a draft Online Safety bill, published earlier this year &#8212; have yet to go through parliamentary scrutiny. But in one already baked in change, the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">now enforcing a children&#8217;s design code</a> which stipulates that platforms need to prioritize kids&#8217; privacy by default, among other recommended standards.</p>
<p>The Age Appropriate Design Code was appended to the UK&#8217;s data protection bill as an amendment &#8212; meaning it sits under wider legislation that transposed Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into law, which brought in supersized penalties for violations like data breaches. And in recent months a number of social media giants have announced changes to how they handle children&#8217;s accounts and data &#8212; which the ICO has credited to the code.</p>
<p>So the government may be feeling confident that it has finally found a blueprint for bringing tech giants to heel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced yesterday that it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435323978734841857">testing a feature</a> on the web that makes it possible to remove followers without blocking them. Sometimes, users want to stop a follower from seeing their tweets without outright blocking them &#8212; if that follower were to navigate directly to their page, it&#8217;d be clear that they had been blocked, which can pose safety risks. Now, some Twitter users with access to this test can remove a follower by navigating to their profile and clicking to view their list of followers. Then, they can click on a three dot icon next to the follow button and select &#8220;remove this follower&#8221; from the drop-down menu. Not all users currently have this functionality.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re making it easier to be the curator of your own followers list. Now testing on web: remove a follower without blocking them.</p>
<p>To remove a follower, go to your profile and click “Followers”, then click the three dot icon and select “Remove this follower”. <a href="https://t.co/2Ig7Mp8Tnx">pic.twitter.com/2Ig7Mp8Tnx</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Previously, users had maneuvered this &#8220;soft block&#8221; themselves &#8212; if you block a user, then unblock them, it removes them from your followers list. The current test only allows you to remove followers from your own follower list, so if you&#8217;re a particularly popular tweeter, it could be difficult to scroll through thousands of names to find the one person you&#8217;re looking for. But according to app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, Twitter has also been working on the ability to remove a follower from their profile, not just your own followers list.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Twitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Twitter</a> is working on an option to remove followers directly from their profile <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/g9Q1ve3qS1">pic.twitter.com/g9Q1ve3qS1</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The platform is showing a continued investment in user experience updates focused on web safety. Last week, it revealed a suite of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-to-get-more-people-tweeting">privacy tools</a> that it&#8217;s working on, which included the ability to remove followers. The platform also proposed the potential to archive tweets after 30, 60, or 90 days, hiding liked tweets, and leaving conversations. While third-party programs like <a href="https://semiphemeral.com/">Semiphemeral</a> have long made it possible to automatically old tweets and unlike messages, having these features built into the app itself could make it easier for users to have greater control over their digital presence without sharing their data with outside developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig and independent workers have different needs when it comes to financial products than salaried employees at a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a challenge that Tilak Joshi, founder of </span><a href="http://www.withlean.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, became acutely aware of during his tenure as head of Mint and years as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product exec at American Express and PayPal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the U.S. has seen a major shift in more independent workers in recent years, traditional financial institutions have “failed to keep up,” in his view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seventy percent of independent workers live paycheck to paycheck and 30% are inadequately insured,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Independent workers will soon become the majority of the US workforce, and the existing conversation, platforms, and institutions need to rapidly evolve to support them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon leaving Mint in 2020, Joshi founded Lean to support gig workers with a platform that offers access to financial products that he says are “custom built” for their needs. And today, Lean is announcing it has raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by Inspired Capital that included participation from Atelier Ventures, Oceans Ventures and Acequia Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, a slew of marketplace industry operators also put money in the round including DoorDash exec Gokul Rajaram; Instacart co-founder Max Mullen; Manik Gupta, ex-CPO Uber; , Vivek Patel, ex-COO of Postmates), Bird CPO Ryan Fujiu and others. The latest financing brings Lean’s total raised to nearly $6 million to date. Other high-profile angels who have backed the company include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charlie Songhurst, Lightspeed Venture Partners (and former Stripe exec) Justin Overdorff, Coinbase’s Marc Bhargava, and executives from ANGI Homeservices, Coinbase and Plaid.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Independent workers see some of the most restrictive financial scenarios of anywhere in the U.S.,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “What workers do to patch up their financial problems is work across various gig marketplaces and when marketplaces try to keep them and pay them incentives, they just figure out how to game the system. It just turns into inefficiency on both sides where marketplaces don&#8217;t really have the stability of having a strong workforce they can rely on and workers are also just in a tight spot.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2199197 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=300,294 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=768,754 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=680,667 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean aims to help independent workers by partnering directly with marketplaces to offer financial products and benefits. The goal is to help marketplaces with worker acquisition and retention by giving gig workers access to “no-cost capital, instant payouts and financial products such as mortgages, “low-to-no-cost borrowing,” HSAs and insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean works with marketplaces of all sizes that employ either 1099 or W2 workers that work in industries such as ride-hailing, courier, healthcare and construction. Joshi said that in addition to boosting worker acquisition and retention, Lean has the potential to &#8220;unlock&#8221; revenue for marketplaces via financial products and infrastructure rather than through fees to workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform, Joshi said, is designed to be integrated with any marketplace in less than two weeks. Through its marketplace partnerships, Lean expects to be rolling out to “hundreds of thousands” of gig workers across the country over the coming months, according to Joshi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no cost for marketplaces and no cost for workers. Lean expects to earn revenue through the fees associated with the movement of money via its platform, Joshi said. So far, the startup has inked deals with half a dozen marketplaces, and has another half a dozen in the works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its offering and continue to scale across marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Batsiyan, partner at Inspired Capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says he was attracted to Lean because of the team, market timing and approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are huge market tailwinds to better serving gig workers, and marketplaces are increasingly searching for better ways to attract and retain their workers,” he wrote via email. “Also, Tilak [Joshi] came to a similar conclusion to us at Inspired: that marketplaces would not build these solutions themselves. They need an intermediary &#8212; like Lean &#8212; to make financial benefits a turnkey solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batsiyan also believes that Lean’s B2B2C approach is unique. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a platform, Lean can then leverage its partnerships to achieve much more efficient distribution to the end workers,” he said. </span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mint&#8217;s first product manager <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/monarch-raises-4-8m/">raised $4.8 million in seed funding</a> for <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch</a>, a subscription-based platform that aims to help consumers “plan and manage” their financial lives.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (popularizing the modern internet). He didn’t protect the technology because he wanted it to benefit us all. Three decades later, most of the power &#8212; and a lot of the profits &#8212; of the internet are in the hands of a few tech billionaires, and much of the early promise of the internet remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p>To avoid the same fate for space, we need to subsidize new players to create competition and lower costs, as well as regulate space travel to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Space matters. It could create countless jobs and fuel economies, and may even hold the solution to climate change. Investors can already see this, having poured billions into space companies in an industry with a potential market value of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/why-the-space-industry-may-triple-to-1point4-trillion-by-2030.html">$1.4 trillion</a> by 2030.</p>
<p>Space may seem too vast to be dominated by a few tech billionaires, but in 1989, so did the internet. We need to get this right, because from the mechanics and aerospace engineers to the marketing, information and logistics workers, the space industry could fuel global job creation and economic growth.</p>
<p>For that to happen, we need competition. What we have now is a few players operating perhaps for their founders’ benefits, not the world’s.</p>
<p>We should not repeat the mistakes we made with the internet and wait for the technology to be abused before we step in. For example, in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a private technology company used weapons-grade social media manipulation to pursue their own profit (which is their obligation to their shareholders) but to society’s harm (which it is regulators’ job to protect).</p>
<p>In space, the stakes are even higher. They also affect all of humanity, not a few countries. There are environmental dangers (we are probing the carbon cost of “Earth” flights, but not space flights), and an accident, as well as leading to loss of life in space, could send fatal debris to Earth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These dangers are not unforeseen. Virgin Galactic had its <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29857182">first fatality</a> in 2014. A Space X launch puts out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions">as much carbon dioxide</a> as flying around 300 people across the Atlantic. Earlier this year, some unguided space debris from a Chinese rocket <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/science/china-rocket-reentry-falling-long-march-5b.html">landed</a> in the Maldives.</p>
<p>We should not wait until these accidents happen again &#8212; perhaps at a bigger scale &#8212; before we act.</p>
<p>Space tourism can and should be about much more than giving the 1% another Instagrammable moment and increasing the wealth of the billionaires who provide the service.</p>
<p>The space industry should be managed in a way that delivers the most good to the largest number of people. That starts with subsidies.</p>
<p>In short, we should treat space travel like any other form of transit. Making that sustainable economically will almost inevitably require some government intervention.</p>
<p>We have been here before: When the combination of air travel, highways and rising labor costs led the two largest railways in the United States to bankruptcy, the Nixon administration intervened and created Amtrak.</p>
<p>This wasn’t ideologically fueled (quite the opposite). This was a decision to make sure the U.S. reaped the economic benefits of interstate travel. Even though Amtrak remains unprofitable 50 years after its creation, it is a crucial piece of economic infrastructure upon which many other industries &#8212; as well as millions of individuals and families &#8212; rely.</p>
<p>We need to do the same with space travel. Very few individuals will benefit from what will be an uber-luxury segment of the travel market, with Virgin Galactic tickets predicted to cost $250,000 (and that is the entry-level space travel product; Virgin’s competitors are priced at multiples of that cost).</p>
<p>If we subsidize the industry now, while ensuring there are new competitors in space, we can ensure it hits a critical mass where all the broader benefits of space travel become a reality.</p>
<p>This will be much easier than waiting for monopolies to emerge and then trying to fight them (which is what the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is trying to do, decades too late, to Big Tech).</p>
<p>Space travel is not just hype or the plaything of billionaires. It is the final frontier, both physically and economically.</p>
<p>If we want it to be a success, we should learn from our successes and failures back on Earth and apply them to space now.</p>
<p>That means subsidies, support, regulation and safety. These things are important on Earth, but in space they are absolutely essential.</p>

<p>This conversation was spurred by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">TechCrunch Experts project</a>, where we&#8217;re looking for the best growth marketers for startups. Metrick was recommended to us in July (you can read his featured recommendation in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/growth-marketing-roundup-techcrunch-experts-creative-testing-and-how-to-nail-your-narrative/">growth roundup</a>) and we were eager to learn from his experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this conversation, we cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Influencers taking on the marketing world</li>
<li>The challenges marketers face with iOS 14</li>
<li>How Metrick sees trends developing geographically</li>
<li>What holiday advertising might look like in 2021</li>
<li>How to build a growth marketing team</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie, </strong></p>
<p><strong>My husband just accepted a job in Silicon Valley. His new employer will be sponsoring him for an E-3 visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I would like to continue working after we move to the United States. I understand I can get a work permit with the E-3 visa for spouses. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How soon can I apply for my U.S. work permit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Adaptive Aussie</strong></p>
<p>Dear Adaptive,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question and congrats on the new employment opportunities for both you and your husband! Listen to <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/087-all-the-ways-to-get-a-work-permit/">my podcast episode on work permits</a>, or Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) as they are officially known, to find out who qualifies for one, when you can apply for one, what you can do with one and how long it takes to get one.</p>
<p>You can apply for a work permit once you arrive in the United States in E-3 status (a professional work visa for Australians in the U.S.). It’s not possible to apply for a work permit at the consulate in Sydney when you apply for your E-3 visas. To do that, you will need to submit <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-765">Form I-765</a> (Application for Employment Authorization) and supporting documents to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If USCIS approves your application, you will not be able to start working until you receive the physical, plastic EAD card, which proves to prospective employers that you are authorized to work in the United States.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2100312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1800" height="1187" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>How long will it take?</h2>
<p>USCIS is currently backlogged and is taking about 11 months to process EAD applications. Since any mistakes or omissions in an EAD application can create further delays, I recommend hiring an immigration attorney to submit the application on your behalf. An immigration attorney can also discuss other options that could enable you to start working sooner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video editing software may become the next big addition to Microsoft&#8217;s suite of productivity tools. On Tuesday, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/09/07/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-to-empower-creators/">announced</a> it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://clipchamp.com/en/">Clipchamp</a>, a company offering web-based video creation and editing software that allows anyone to put together video presentations, promos or videos meant for social media destinations like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. According to Microsoft, Clipchamp is a &#8220;natural fit&#8221; to extend its exiting productivity experiences in Microsoft 365 for families, schools, and businesses.</p>
<p>The acquisition appealed to Microsoft for a few reasons. Today, more people are creating and using video, thanks to a growing set of new tools that allow anyone &#8212; even non-professionals &#8212; to quickly and easily perform advanced edits and produce quality video content. This, explains Microsoft, has allowed video to establish itself as a new type of &#8220;document&#8221; for businesses to do things like pitch an idea, explain a process, or communicate with team members.</p>
<p>The company also saw Clipchamp as an interesting acquisition target due to how it combined &#8220;the simplicity of a web app with the full computing power of a PC with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,&#8221; it said. That makes the software a good fit for the Microsoft Windows customer base, as well.</p>
<p>Clipchamp itself had built a number of online tools in the video creation and editing space, including its video maker Clipchamp Create, which offers features for trimming, cutting, cropping, rotating, speed control, and adding text, audio, images, colors, and filters. It also provides other tools that make video creation easier, like templates, free stock video and audio libraries, screen recorders, text-to-speech tools, and others for simplifying a brand&#8217;s fonts, colors and logos for use in video. A discontinued set of utilities called Clipchamp Utilities had once included a video compressor and converters, as well as an in-browser webcam recorder. Some of this functionality was migrated over to the new Clipchamp app, however.</p>
<p>After producing the videos with Clipchamp, creators can choose between different output styles and aspect ratios for popular social media networks, making it a popular tool for online marketers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199381" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199381" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg 3298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=1536,650 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=2048,867 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clipchamp.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clipchamp</p></div></p>
<p>Since its founding in 2013, Clipchamp grew to attract over 17 million registered users and has served over 390,000 companies, growing at a rate of 54% year-over-year. As the pandemic forced more organizations towards remote work, the use of video has grown as companies adopted the medium for training, communication, reports, and more. During the first half of 2021, Clipchamp <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/clipchamp_achieves_17_million_registered_users_announces_massive_54_year_over_year_company_growth/prweb18067370.htm">saw a 186% increase in video exports</a>. Videos using the 16:9 aspect ratio grew by 189% while the 9:16 aspect ratio for sharing to places like Instagram Stories and TikTok grew by 140% and the 1:1 aspect ratio for Instagram grew 72%. Screen recording also grew 57% and webcam recording grew 65%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July, Clipchamp CEO Alexander Dreiling commented on this growth, noting the company had nearly tripled its team over the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are acquiring two times more users on average than we did at the same time a year ago while also doubling the usage rate, meaning more users are creating video content than ever before. While social media videos have always been at the forefront of business needs, during the past year we’ve also witnessed the rapid adoption of internal communication use cases where there is a lot of screen and webcam recording taking place in our platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn&#8217;t disclose the acquisition price, but Clipchamp had raised over $15 million in funding according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clipchamp-pty-ltd">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Microsoft&#8217;s first attempt at entering the video market.</p>
<p>The company was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/microsoft-pursuing-tiktok-purchase-with-september-15th-deadline-may-invite-u-s-investors-to-participate/">one of the suitors pursuing TikTok</a> when the Trump administration was working to force a sale of the China-owned video social network which Trump had dubbed a national security threat. (In order to keep TikTok running in the U.S., ByteDance would have needed to have divested TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations. But that sale never came to be as the Biden administration paused the effort.) Several years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/microsoft-stream-is-a-new-video-service-for-businesses/">Microsoft also launched a business video service called Stream</a>, that aimed to allow enterprises to use video as easily as consumers use YouTube. In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/microsoft-acquires-social-learning-platform-flipgrid/">it acquired social learning platform Flipgrid,</a> which used short video clips for collaboration. And as remote work became the norm, Microsoft has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode/">adding more video capabilities</a> to its team collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s deal follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/adobe-buying-frame-io-in-1-28b-deal/">Adobe&#8217;s recent $1.28 acquisition</a> of the video review and collaboration platform Frame.io, which has been used by over a million people since its founding in 2014. However, unlike Clipchamp, whose tools are meant for anyone to use at work, school, or home, Frame.io is aimed more directly at creative professionals.</p>
<p>Dreiling said Clipchamp will continue to grow at Microsoft, with a focus on making video editing accessible to more people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Few companies in tech have the legacy and reach that Microsoft has. We all grew up with iconic Microsoft products and have been using them ever since,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Becoming part of Microsoft allows us to become part of a future legacy. Under no other scenario could our future look more exciting than what’s ahead of us now. At Clipchamp we have always said that we’re not suffering from a lack of opportunity, there absolutely is an abundance of opportunity in video. We just need to figure out how to seize it. Inside Microsoft we can approach seizing our opportunity in entirely new ways,&#8221; Dreiling added.</p>
<p>Microsoft did not say when it expected to integrate Clipchamp into its existing software suite, saying it would share more at a later date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mayors have the toughest job in the world, and leading a city is only getting harder. Even as populations swell in urban cores across the world, climate change is constraining the geographies where that growth can happen. Coastal communities which are popular with residents are also taking a gamble when it comes to rising sea levels. How do you tradeoff a need for growth with the requirement for protecting residents from disaster?</p>
<p>In most cases, the pendulum is fully tilted toward growth. Coastal towns continue to allow widespread sprawl and development, chasing ever more property taxes and residents even as sea levels get ever more uncomfortably high. It’s a recipe for disaster — and one that many cities have chosen to bake anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.withforerunner.com">Forerunner</a> wants that pendulum to swing the other way. Its platform allows city planners and building managers to survey, investigate and enforce stricter building codes and land use standards with a focus on mitigating future flood damage. It’s particularly focused on American cities with heavy usage of the federal flood insurance program, and Forerunner helps cities maximize their adherence to that program’s byzantine rules.</p>

<p>The company pulls in data from FEMA and other sources to determine a property’s mandatory lowest floor height requirement, and whether the property conforms to that rule. It also tracks flood zone boundaries and helps with the administrative overhead of processing federal flood insurance documentation, such as creating and managing elevation certificates.</p>
<p>Co-founders JT White and Susanna Pho have been friends for years and worked at the MIT Media Lab before eventually coming together in early 2019 to build out this floodplain management product. “It cannot be underscored enough that a lot of communities just don’t follow [federal flood] regulations,” Pho said. “They will revert their ordinances from something more strict … since they can’t do a lot of day-to-day compliance.”</p>
<p>Coastal cities devastated by floods are protected by federal flood insurance, but that often creates a moral hazard: since damage is paid for, there isn’t much incentive to avoid it in the first place. The federal government is attempting to tighten those standards, and there is also a sense among a new generation of city planners and municipal leaders that the build-devastation-rebuild model of many cities needs to stop given climate change. After flooding, “we want to see communities rebuild to higher standards,” White said. “The sort of cycle of rebuilding and doing the same thing over and over again is infuriating to us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Transitioning to a new model isn’t easy of course. “There are a lot of hard decisions that these communities must make,” he said, but “our software makes it a bit easier to do these things.” So far, the company has gotten early traction with 33 communities currently using Forerunner according to the founders.</p>
<p>Although it has customer clusters in Louisiana and northern New Jersey, the company’s largest customer is Harris County, which includes much of the Houston, Texas metro area. The county could potentially save $5 million on their flood insurance premiums with better adherence to federal standards, according to White. “One of the benefits of our product is that we can help you protect and increase this immediate discount to every flood insurance policyholder in your community starting next year,” he said. Ultimately though, FEMA focuses on disincentives rather than incentives. “The biggest stick that FEMA has is that it can suspend communities from the flood insurance program,” he noted.</p>
<p>The company raised an early seed round in 2019, and has been focused on building up the platform’s capabilities and getting the sales flywheel spinning — which can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">a tough order in the govtech space</a>.</p>
<p>Even as demand intensifies for more housing and growth, climate change is simultaneously placing its own demands on cities. Mayors and city leaders are increasingly going to have to transition from the growth models of the past to the resilient models of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Notion said on Wednesday it has acquired <a href="https://automate.io/">Automate.io</a>, an Indian startup that builds connectivity and integrations with over 200 services, as the workplace productivity startup looks to accelerate its product expansion to become more compelling for tens of millions of individuals and businesses that are increasingly moving to digital collaborative tools.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered startup, which was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">valued at $2 billion in private markets</a>, said the acquisition of the Hyderabad-headquartered Automate will help Notion understand the know-how of &#8212; and leverage &#8212; the 200 integrations the Indian startup has developed to give users and enterprises alike the ability to bring their most workflows into Notion.</p>
<p>The acquisition, first for Notion, is a “strategic piece to our puzzle,” said Akshay Kothari, chief operating officer of Notion, in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s a sizable acquisition,” he said, though he did not disclose the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Acquiring Automate &#8212; which had only raised capital once, and that too largely from friends and family, and which like Notion is profitable &#8212; is also enabling Notion to set up an engineering center in India, its first outside of the U.S., he said. (He expects to set up more offices in India, where the startup&#8217;s product is already popular especially among startup circles, in the future.)</p>
<p>Automate, which employs about 40 people, has developed a wide-range of integrations with firms operating in several industries including e-commerce, payments, marketing, social, and productivity. One of the firms it has built a number of integrations for is Notion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199355" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199355" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199355 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1133" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg?resize=768,580 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg?resize=680,514 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/notion-automate.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199355" class="wp-caption-text">A look at some of the popular services for which Automate.io has developed integrations.</p></div></p>
<p>A Notion user / admin can use Automate to connect the collaborative platform to Slack, Gmail, Mailchimp, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Office 365, Dropbox, WordPress, RSS Feed, PayPal and dozens of other services, for instance. “Each product has an API. What Automate has done is work with each API to build pipes in a way that users themselves don’t have to worry to get work done,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notion discovered Automate a few months ago when it launched its API to the public. “I hadn’t heard of them. But because they were one of our first partners, I looked into who they are,” said Kothari, who reached out to Ashok Gudibandla, chief executive of Automate.io, a few months ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission has always been to support businesses by automating repetitive tasks, and to be more efficient. We want users to spend less time dealing with challenging integrations, and more time building and creating the software they need,&#8221; said Gudibandla in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with Notion, we&#8217;ll be able to offer the same integration and automation experience to a broader set of users across the globe. We are thrilled to be joining forces with Notion, an ideal partner who shares our values and commitment to extending the power of a collaborative, seamless software experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Automate.io currently offers some paid plans and will continue to offer those to customers, said Kothari.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a side note, as a longtime Notion customer, I asked Kothari if the company is working on adding support for Apple Pencil and Spotlight search on Mac. Both are in the firm&#8217;s to-do list. He offered me a glimpse at some of the things the startup is working on &#8212; and the list is quite big (the startup tracks every feature request, even those made on Twitter) &#8212; and Spotlight search integration on iPhone should ship soon.</p>
<p>With Automate.io, Kothari said he expects Notion to be able to get some of these features out sooner. &#8220;The challenge we face is that Notion is currently used by individuals, individuals working at companies, and those companies. Each person has a unique request. One of the things we are trying to do is stay horizontal,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizations are swimming in data these days, and so solutions to help manage and use that data in more efficient ways will continue to see a lot of attention and business. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SingleStore</a> &#8212; which provides a platform to enterprises to help them integrate, monitor and query their data as a single entity, regardless of whether that data is stored in multiple repositories &#8212; is announcing another $80 million in funding, money that it will be using to continue investing in its platform, hiring more talent and overall business expansion. Sources close to the company tell us that the company&#8217;s valuation has grown to $940 million.</p>
<p>The round, a Series F, is being led by Insight Partners, with new investor Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and previous backers Khosla Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital, Rev IV, Glynn Capital, and GV (formerly Google Ventures) also participating. The startup has to date raised $264 million, including most recently an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/singlestore-formerly-memsql-raises-80m-to-integrate-and-leverage-companies-disparate-data-silos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million Series E</a> as recently as last December, just on the heels of rebranding from MemSQL.</p>
<p>The fact that there are three major strategic investors in this Series F &#8212; HPE, Dell and Google &#8212; may say something about the traction that SingleStore is seeing, but so too do its numbers: 300%+ increase in new customer acquisition for its cloud service and 150%+ year-over-year growth in cloud</p>
<p>Raj Verma, SingleStore&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview that its cloud revenues have grown by 150% year over year and now account for some 40% of all revenues (up from 10% a year ago). New customer numbers, meanwhile, have grown by over 300%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flywheel is now turning around,&#8221; Verma said. &#8220;We didn’t need this money. We&#8217;ve barely touched our Series E. But I think there has been a general sentiment among our board and management that we are now ready for the prime time. We think SingleStore is one of the best kept secrets in the database market. Now we want to aggressively be an option for people looking for a platform for intensive data applications or if they want to consolidate databases to 1 from 3, 5 or 7 repositories. We are where the world is going: real-time insights.&#8221;</p>
<p>With database management and the need for more efficient and cost-effective tools to manage that becoming an ever-growing priority &#8212; one that definitely got a fillip in the last 18 months with Covid-19 pushing people into more remote working environments. That means SingleStore is not without competitors, with others in the same space including Amazon, Microsoft, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis and more. Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/firebolt-raises-37m-to-take-on-snowflake-amazon-and-google-with-a-new-approach-to-data-warehousing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebolt</a> are tackling the challenges of handing large, disparate data repositories from another angle. (Some of these, I should point out, are also partners: SingleStore works with data stored on AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat, and Verma describes those who do compute work as &#8220;not database companies; they are using their database capabilities for consumption for cloud compute.&#8221;)</p>
<p>But the company has carved a place for itself with enterprises and has thousands now on its books, including GE, IEX Cloud, Go Guardian, Palo Alto Networks, EOG Resources, and SiriusXM + Pandora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">“SingleStore’s first-of-a-kind cloud database is unmatched in speed, scale, and simplicity by anything in the market,” said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, in a statement. “SingleStore’s differentiated technology allows customers to unify real-time transactions and analytics in a single database.” Vinod Khosla from Khosla Ventures added that “SingleStore is able to reduce data sprawl, run anywhere, and run faster with a single database, replacing legacy databases with the modern cloud.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new fund comes as the global sports technology market is poised to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 17.5% to reach $40.2 billion by 2026.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sports and health technology investor <a href="https://www.leadsports.com/">leAD Sports &amp; Health Tech Partners</a> and private investment organization Tavistock Group have come together to launch the $30 million <a href="http://www.lakenonafund.com/">Lake Nona Sports &amp; Health Tech Fund</a> for early-stage startups in the areas of fan engagement, connected athletes, health and well-being.</p>
<p>In addition to both of those general partners, investors in the fund include Kevin Reid, Andrew White and Harold Primat, leAD co-founder and CEO Christoph Sonnen told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, leAD Sports &amp; Health Tech Partners was inspired by Adi Dassler, who founded sportswear company Adidas. Dassler’s family is one of the partners and biggest funders to date, Sonnen said.</p>
<p>Its first fund, called Advantage, invested at the Series A stage and has four companies under it currently, and will eventually have 10 to 15 companies in the portfolio, Anne Joachim, leAD’s finance director, said.</p>
<p>The Lake Nona fund will invest in seed and pre-Series A to support founders by bridging the gap between those two rounds to help them grow, she added. The fund is expected to be able to invest in 20 companies with smaller ticket sizes.</p>
<p>“When we moved to Nona, we were looking to integrate between sports and health tech, especially in the areas of mindfulness and longevity, which are two hot topics we are seeing,” Sonnen said.</p>
<p>The new fund comes as the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/04/2241923/28124/en/The-17-9-Billion-Worldwide-Sports-Technology-Industry-is-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-17-5-From-2021-to-2026.html">global sports technology market</a> is poised to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 17.5% to reach $40.2 billion by 2026, up from a valuation of around $17.9 billion in 2021, according to consultancy ResearchandMarkets.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sonnen expects sports, esports and healthcare to be one big trend, driven by the global pandemic, that he doesn’t see stopping soon. For example, rather than people going back to the gym exclusively, it will be a hybrid of workouts and a bigger emphasis on sleep and recovery.</p>
<p>Of the technology out there, Joachim says devices enabling users to train in different ways is one of the more faster-moving segments.</p>
<p>“We learned during COVID about training without the gym, and we see more fascinating things coming out of that,” she added. “We are already seeing new technologies really disrupt the market and expect this to continue over the next couple of the years. We are also seeing more companies focused on mindfulness and training the brain like your body.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DJI’s camera stabilization tech started life as an outgrowth of its drone tech, and has managed to develop into a robust line of its own. Roughly this time last year, the company announced that its smartphone-focused Osmo line was being rebranded to the simpler OM. Today, the OM 5 arrives, with a more compact design, improved image tracking and an upgraded phone clamp.</p>
<p>Portability seems to be the primary selling point this time out. The device is roughly one-third smaller than last year’s model, making it a fair bit lighter than the OM 4, as well. The device now ships with a built-in extension rod (to capture more angles) and improved physical controls with additional on-board buttons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199131" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199131" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2199131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg 7680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DJI</p></div></p>
<p>DJI appears to be focusing a bit more on entry-level users this time out, with a new ShotGuide feature that has access to tutorials and editing to capture better shots the first time around. The system’s image tracking gets an upgrade, as well. “ActiveTrack 4.0 now supports tracking at up to 3x zoom at 5 m/s, and precisely identifies and steadily follows the subject centered in frame, even while in action,” per the company.</p>

<p>The three-axis system has a bunch of built-in shooting modes, as is DJI’s wont. The list includes Gesture Control, Timelapse/Motionlapse/Hyperlapse, Panorama, Dynamic Zoom (for a Hitchcock-style effect), Glamour Effects for automatic retouches and a Spin Shot mode, which, well, spins the phone around a bunch. There are also a number of templates for Story Mode, adding music and movements &#8212; basically it’s social media mode.</p>
<p>The new clamp is designed to fit over a case &#8212; meaning you don’t have to pull off the protection in order to get your phone on the OM 5. There’s also a new Fill Light Phone Clamp accessory, which adds a light to the front of the device. That will run $59 when it’s available at an unspecified later date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The OM 5, meanwhile, is available starting today for $159.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product quality is hugely important when it comes to the success of a product. Even if your product seems really cool, if it’s buggy or doesn’t work well, many people will just stop using it rather than taking the time to figure it out or even report a problem.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.unitq.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UnitQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Burlingame, California-based startup using a data-driven approach to product quality, today announced it has raised $30 million in a Series B funding round led by <a href="http://www.accel.com">Accel</a> to tackle this issue. In a nutshell, the company uses artificial intelligence to help businesses determine what is specifically impacting product quality at any given time, notes unitQ co-founder and CEO Christian Wiklund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he would not disclose valuation or hard revenue figures, the CEO says unitQ has been tripling its ARR (annual recurring revenue) every 12 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SaaS company’s goal is to give engineering, support, product ops and product management teams the ability to identify and, more importantly, fix quality issues that might be impacting customer satisfaction and retention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, unitQ says it identifies actionable insights in a variety of ways. For one, it gathers user feedback from public sources like app reviews and social media and from private sources such as support tickets, support chats and surveys. It also does this through its own API, which connects to other external data sources. Currently, the company integrates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">into, and pulls insights from, 26 platforms and also ingests the data from anywhere there is user feedback.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI startup investment is on pace for a record year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/ai-startup-investment-is-on-pace-for-a-record-year/embed/#?secret=CRK3wkujwb" data-secret="CRK3wkujwb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all these data points, Wiklund said, unitQ then “automatically tags and analyzes” quality issues with the goal of delivering “the most comprehensive and accurate view of product quality yet.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is mostly focused on consumer companies, but also has some B2B clients. Customers include Chime, Pandora, The RealReal, NerdWallet, Strava and AppLovin, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to not only enable them to move faster and build higher-quality products, we want to help them build a quality company,” Wiklund told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise behind the company is that these days, when so many consumer-facing industries are incredibly crowded, it can be difficult to stand out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Product features are a bit too easy to replicate and copy so most apps and products have a very similar feature set,” he said. “It’s hard to compete with features pricing too. Even content is becoming a commodity. But quality is the one thing that we all experience and the one thing that when we touch a product, we form our opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And poor quality, Wiklund maintains, can impact the growth of a company in many ways, such as reputation and pace of product development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we want to make sure that every conversion cycle inside of the product is as fine-tuned as possible,” he said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199160" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199160 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg 2386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1360 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-product-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> UnitQ</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says that on average, its customers are able to increase their product quality by 20% in 30 days. It also touts that its technology is able to glean insights that are more valuable than Net Promoter Scores (NPS) &#8212; a tool used by many product teams that tend to be based mostly on surveys that are proactively sent out by businesses. Such scores, Wiklund said, are more likely to capture positive sentiments and “represent a tiny fraction of users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers </span><a href="https://www.creandum.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creandum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; the early-stage Swedish fund which also backed Shopify &#8212; and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gradient-ventures">Gradient Ventures</a>, Google’s AI-focused venture fund, also put money in the round, which brings the startup’s total amount raised since its 2018 launch to $41 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UnitQ plans to use its new capital toward beefing up its engineering and go-to-market teams, according to Wiklund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for unitQ was born out of the co-founding duo&#8217;s previous company, Skout. That </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/03/skout-andreessen-horowitz-22m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz-backed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">social app had over 50 million app installations before being <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160627006328/en/MeetMe-to-Acquire-Skout">acquired by MeetMe</a> for $28.5 million in cash and approximately 5.37 million common shares in 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the decade we worked on Skout, we never lost sight of the user experience and our top priority was ensuring people were happy with our product,” Wiklund recalls. “We would have loved to have access to a product like unitQ.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199164" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199164" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199164 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-christian-nik.jpeg?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-christian-nik.jpeg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-christian-nik.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-christian-nik.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unitq-christian-nik.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199164" class="wp-caption-text">DI Repotage</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Braccia and Ben Fletcher of Accel, who worked on the deal, believe the fact that the founding team are repeat founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who intimately understand the problem that they are solving is a big advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The customer feedback was over-the-top positive. Spotify, Cornershop, Pinterest, Whoop and Strava all rave that not only does unitQ ingest all of their data from app store reviews, internal support tickets and social media feedback, but they correlate this data so that it gives them the highest-value bug and improvement fixes for their products, something they could not find elsewhere,” Fletcher told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also believe that unitQ is creating a category around aggregating user feedback and then tying it back to product and engineering teams.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Similar to PagerDuty for incident management and DataDog for performance observability; unitQ is creating a new category around product quality and quality scores and indicators for their end customers; we think this would be really, really large,” Braccia added. “Teams are citing that churn is going down, revenue is going up, and engineering teams are shipping code faster for the things that really matter for their products because of the insights that they are getting from unitQ.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google is tying everything together with a handbook for navigating hybrid work, which includes best practice blueprints for five common hybrid meetings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employee location has become a bit more complicated as some return to the office, while others work remotely. To embrace those hybrid working conditions, Google is making more changes to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/g-suite-is-now-google-workspace/">Google Workspace</a> offering by going live with spaces — its tool for small group sharing — in Google Chat for all users.</p>
<p>Spaces integrates with Workspace tools, like the calendar, Drive and documents, to provide a more hybrid work experience where users can see the full history, content and context of conversations regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Google’s senior director of product management Sanaz Ahari<span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in a blog post</span> that customers wanted spaces to be more like a “central hub for collaboration, both in real time and asynchronously. Instead of starting an email chain or scheduling a video meeting, teams can come together directly in a space to move projects and topics along.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are some new features users can see in spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">One interface for everything — inbox, chats, spaces and meetings.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Spaces, and content therein, can be made discoverable for people to find and join in the conversation.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Better search ability within a team’s knowledge base.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ability to reply to any message within a space.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Enhanced security and admin tools to monitor communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees can now <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/join-meeting-virtually-or-in-person-google-calendar.html">indicate if they will be virtual or in-person</a> on certain days in Calendar for collaboration expectations. As a complement, users can call colleagues on both mobile and desktop devices in Google Meet.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199238" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199238" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/calendar-worklocation.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199238" class="wp-caption-text">Calendar work location</p></div></p>
<p>In November, all customers will be able to use Google Meet’s Companion Mode to join a meeting from a personal device while tapping into in-room audio and video. Also later this year, live-translated captions will be available in English to French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, with more languages being added in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Google is also expanding its Google Meet hardware portfolio to include two new all-in-one video conferencing devices, third-party devices — Logitech’s video bar and Appcessori’s mobile device speaker dock — and interoperability with Webex by Cisco.</p>
<p>Google is tying everything together with a <a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/navigating-work-handbook/dl-cd.html">handbook for navigating hybrid work</a>, which includes best practice blueprints for five common hybrid meetings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later is officially everywhere, and Latin America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, one startup in the region, </span><a href="http://www.addi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is announcing a $75 million extension to its Series B, bringing the total round size to $140 million. In late May, the startup announced it had raised $35 million in an equity round led by Union Square’s Opportunity Fund, and $30 million in debt funding from Architect Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has dual headquarters in Bogota, Colombia, and São Paulo, Brazil, declined to reveal its new valuation other than to say it is &#8220;nearly triple&#8221; what it was 90 days ago when it closed on the first tranche of its Series B, and that it is now in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Greycroft led the extension, which also included participation from new backers GGV Capital, Citius Capital and Intersection Growth Partners, as well as existing investors Union Square’s Opportunity Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Endeavor Catalyst, Foundation Capital, Monashees and Quona Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, Addi has now raised a total of $220 million in debt and equity since its September 2018 inception &#8212; $140 million of that in equity and over $80 million in debt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi co-founder and CEO Santiago Suarez, says he, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Vallejo and Elmer Ortega</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started the company with a vision of making digital commerce a reality in Latin America &#8212; a region where an estimated fewer than 25% of people have a credit card.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To do this, we had to solve the payment problem,” he said. “We wanted to make frictionless payments possible while allowing customers to afford what they wanted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi started with a buy now, pay later offering, which allowed consumers to make purchases in minutes with “just a few clicks.” Today, the company allows customers to pay for their purchases over three months at no cost. For bigger purchases, Addi lets them pay for up to 24 months at what it describes as “competitive and fair rates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi is currently available for e-commerce, mobile and brick-and-mortar purchases in Brazil and Colombia, with plans to expand across Latin America in the coming years. In particular, it plans to enter the Mexican market in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of this year alone, Addi has grown its GMV (gross merchandise volume) by 13x, according to Suarez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And our ARR has seen similar growth,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, Addi temporarily saw a slowdown in business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it quickly bounced back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We lost 99% of our GMV in 20 days when the pandemic hit. We had to make some painful decisions, including letting go of many of our colleagues at a very difficult time,” Suarez recalled. “We also refocused the business on e-commerce and digital payments, and we haven’t looked back since then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Addi reached its pre-COVID high again in March/April of 2021, and has grown by about 3x since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is more focused on growth than profitability, Suarez added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This round has increased our focus on making digital commerce ubiquitous and accessible across Latin America,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Latin America </span><a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/argentina-was-the-country-where-e-commerce-grew-the-most-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in e-commerce sales growth last year. For its part, Addi currently has more than 150,000 customers, a number that is growing at 30% to 40% month over month. On the merchant side, it has close to 500 merchant partners, including brands such as Arturo Calle, Mario Hernandez, Keep Running and Claro. Earlier this year, it inked a strategic partnership with Banco Santander.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi currently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 260 employees (or as Suarez put it, partners), up from less than 120 a year ago. The company prides itself as being “one of the few Latin American startups” that grants equity to everyone on staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we make it a point of speaking about partners and co-owners rather than employees,” Suarez told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>The company plans to use the new capital to speed up its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> product roadmap and geographic expansion. On the product side, it will be launching &#8220;a one-click checkout solution&#8221; for its merchant partners and customers by year&#8217;s end. Addi will also be accelerating its entry into Mexico, as mentioned previously, where it&#8217;s aiming to launch in early 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greycroft’s Thabet Mahayni said that prior to investing in Addi, his firm had been tracking the startup “for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to an exceptional team, we believe the BNPL value proposition is stronger in LatAm than anywhere else in the world,” Mahayni told TechCrunch. “We&#8230;believe they have an opportunity to fundamentally reshape the entire consumer payments experience in the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is in part because currently, consumers in Latin America have very few alternatives when it comes to credit, he points out. Card penetration is very low and those who apply for credit “face a cumbersome and frustrating application process,” Mahayni added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those who do have credit cards are often given very low limits with high interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s easy to see how this dynamic makes it difficult and expensive for consumers to access safe and reliable credit,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi, according to Mahayni, has “rebuilt the entire onboarding, underwriting and fraud stack so they can provide safer credit alternatives to consumers while enabling merchants to meaningfully increase their basket sizes and GMV.”</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second LatAm investment for Greycroft, which previously invested in Rocket.chat, a Brazilian enterprise communication and collaboration platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mexico next year, Addi will join existing player, Nelo. That startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/nelo-raises-3m-to-grow-buy-now-pay-later-in-mexico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April, and at the time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was live with more than 45 merchants and over 150,000 users. Also, Alchemy earlier this year </span><a href="https://www.trustalchemy.com/press-release/alchemy-enters-latin-america-with-buy-now-pay-later-client/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered the Mexican market</span></a>.</p>

The service, which lets you pick up goods from shelves and (yep) just walk out, is coming to new stores in Washington DC and Sherman Oaks, California next year, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/whole-foods-market-to-launch-just-walk-out-technology-at-two-locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">announced</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By collaborating with Amazon to introduce Just Walk Out shopping at these two Whole Foods Market stores, our customers will be able to&#8230; save time by skipping the checkout line,&#8221; said Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve detailed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-amazon-go-grocery-store.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">previously</a>, Just Walk Out uses computer vision, sensors and AI to let you walk into a store, sign in with an app, fill up your bags and leave without the need to join a checkout line. On top of using the tech in its own Go and Fresh stores, Amazon signed a deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-amazon-checkout-free-technology-business-just-walk-out.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">last year</a> to license its technology to third-party retailers.</p>
<p>The technology will work the same at Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon. Shoppers can opt to use the tech when they enter the store by scanning an app, inserting a debit card linked to their Amazon account, or by placing their palm over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-adds-its-contactless-palmreading-one-tech-to-more-go-stores-103800363.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Amazon One</a> palm-scanning system.</p>
<p>Unions have <a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-amazon-grocery-expansion-with-cashierless-technology-threatens-good-paying-jobs-of-essential-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">proclaimed</a> that Amazon&#8217;s cashierless tech will cost workers jobs, but Amazon said the new Whole Foods locations will &#8220;employ a comparable number of team members as existing Whole Foods stores of similar sizes.&#8221; Rather, employees will be able to &#8220;spend even more time interacting with customers and delivering a great shopping experience,&#8221; Amazon said in a press release.</p>

Continental thinks it might help. <em>Roadshow</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/continental-greenconcept-future-tire-dandelions-rice-retreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">reports</a> the company has <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/press/press-releases/20210906-tires-greenconcept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">introduced</a> the Conti GreenConcept (yes, a concept tire) where more than half of the materials are &#8220;traceable, renewable and recycled.&#8221; You can even renew the natural rubber tread with little trouble — not a completely new idea, but refreshable treads have generally been reserved for large commercial trucks. Three renewals would be enough to ensure the material used for casing is cut in half relative to the total mileage.</p>
<p>About 35 percent of the materials are renewables, including dandelion rubber, silicate made from rice husk ash and a string of vegetable oils and resins. Another 17 percent is polyester yarn made from recycled PET bottles, reclaimed steel and recovered carbon black.</p>
<p>The design should improve the efficiency of the cars themselves, Continental added. New casing, sidewall and tread patterns make the GreenConcept about 40 percent lighter than a conventional tire at about 16.5lbs, That, in turn, leads to 25 percent lower rolling resistance than the highest-rated tires in the EU. Continental estimates you&#8217;d get six percent more range from an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>While you might not outfit your car with these exact tires any time soon, this is more than just a thought exercise. Continental plans to gradually deploy its recycling technology starting in 2022, including the production of tires using recycled bottles.</p>
<p>Efforts like the Conti GreenConcept are partly meant to burnish Continental&#8217;s public image. It wants to be the most environmentally responsible tire company by 2030, and become completely carbon-neutral by 2050 &#8220;at the latest.&#8221; However, it also hints at a more holistic approach to eco-friendly cars where many components, not just the powertrain, are kinder to the planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based VC fund Gaia Capital Partners has change its name to <a href="https://revaia.com/">Revaia</a> and announced the final closing of its first growth fund, at €250 million. The firm said it exceeded its initial target of €200 million, and the fund will be ‘ESG focused’.</p>
<p>Revaia is also claiming to be Europe’s largest female-founded VC fund, although TechCrunch has not been able to verify that at the time of publication.</p>
<p>As Gaia Capital Partners, Revaia launched its first fund in late 2019, the portfolio for which currently consists of ten investments, including Aircall, recently achieved a unicorn valuation. Other investments include Epsor (Paris: Epsor designs and distributes employee savings and retirement plans), GetAccept (SF: an all-in-one sales enablement solution that assists B2B sales reps in closing remote deals), gohenry (London: a kids money management application), Planity (Paris: an online booking platform for hair and beauty salons), Welcome to the Jungle (Paris: a multichannel media company), and Yubo (Paris: a social platform for Generation Z).</p>
<p>Alice Albizzati, co-founder of Revaia said in a statement: “When we set up the firm, we were determined to create an investment strategy in line with our convictions – a focus on European companies with high ambitions but with no compromise on sustainability – and with the objective of bridging the gap between private and public markets. Our venture has performed beyond our initial expectations.”</p>
<p>The firm now has an office in Paris and Berlin, as well as a presence in New York and Toronto</p>
<p>The fund’s institutional investors include insurance companies such as Generali, Allianz, and Maif, pension funds, other institutional investors such as Bpifrance, as well as over 50 family offices and Angels.</p>
<p>Elina Berrebi, co-founder of Revaia, said: “We are very grateful to our investors and entrepreneurs who trusted us as we accelerated the build-up of our portfolio. This final closing of our first fund is a huge milestone. It is a solid foundation from which we can support future European technology leaders with their ambitions and sustainability plans, as well as expand and internationalize our team while building a strong value creation platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revaia said the new fund had already begun investing, and “two new investments should be announced soon”.</p>
<p>The firm says it aims to invest in around 15 companies and expand across Europe.</p>
<p>It’s also partnered with listed market sustainable investor Sycomore Asset Management.</p>
