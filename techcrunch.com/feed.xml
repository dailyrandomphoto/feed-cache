										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, we held our first dedicated space startup event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a>, featuring some of the industry&#8217;s top founders and leaders, including <strong>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, Lockheed Martin&#8217;s Lisa Callahan, Amazon&#8217;s Dave Limp, NASA&#8217;s Kathy Leuders</strong> and many more. This year, we&#8217;re excited to announce we&#8217;re doing it again with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, happening virtually December 14-15.</p>
<p>Even in just the few short months between when we held <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a> in 2020 and now, there&#8217;s been a lot of major activity in the industry, including many launches and the addition of plenty more in-space infrastructure. NASA is signalling more strongly than ever that it wants to encourage the private sector to replace the International Space Station at the end of its useful life, and working with more startups than ever in it pursuit of ever-great public-private collaboration.</p>
<p>This year is also set to be one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with planned debut commercial or test orbital flights from companies including Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data gold rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren&#8217;t available before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll be diving into this much-expanded launch market, and in the many opportunities available in taking the exploding wealth of data from space-based sources and making those readily available for use in Earth at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> this year. We&#8217;re also looking forward to hearing more about what&#8217;s next in human space exploration, and in securing the stars for the safety and continued access of all.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="http://Fireflies.ai">Fireflies.ai</a> project is a good reminder that not every startup project goes from idea to unicorn-status in 48 minutes. Instead, the startup&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/krish_ramineni?lang=en">Krish Ramineni</a> told TechCrunch about how a period of interest in natural language processing (NLP), tinkering with a friend, a stint at Microsoft, and even working on Slack bots led him to helping found Fireflies.ai (Fireflies), a company that today announced a $14 million raise led by <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla</a>.</p>
<p>Fireflies is a two-part service. Its first point of business is recording and transcribing voice conversations. Things like video meetings, for example. Next, Fireflies wants to plug your voice data into other applications, helping its customers automate data entry, task creation and more.</p>
<p>Before today&#8217;s round, the startup had <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fireflies/company_financials">raised around $5 million</a>, including some micro-rounds, a stint in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">the Acceleprise accelerator</a>, and a $4.9 million seed round raised in late 2019. That investment included participation from Canaan Partners and well-known angel April Underwood.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Fireflies has raised more capital is not surprising, given how quickly it has accreted users. According to an interview with Ramineni, more than 10,000 teams use Fireflies today. In individual usage terms, some 35,000 organizations are represented amongst its user base.</p>
<p>As the company launched its product in early 2020, those results sound pretty good.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch was curious if revenue tracked with usage at Fireflies, as is sometimes the case. It does, Ramineni said, adding that his company grew its revenues 300% in the last six or seven months.</p>
<p>How did it manage such rapid growth while only having raised $5 million before, and with a team that is around 90% in its product and engineering teams? By pursuing everyone&#8217;s favorite: the bottoms-up sales model. In short, you can use Fireflies for free, but if you run out of meeting credits, other usage-based blockers or the need for different, paywalled functionality, you have to cough up for the product.</p>
<p>Folks are, it appears.</p>
<p>Fireflies is in fact an interesting hybrid of SaaS and usage-based pricing. The higher the paid tier that a user selects, the more minutes of transcription they are apportioned per month. But there are caps, limits that users can buy their way out of. TechCrunch asked Ramineni about it, with the CEO explaining that some customers want to ingest years of saved meetings. Our read is that despite work done by the startup to keep its infrastructure costs low, building pricing guardrails around product usage just makes sense for the startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mFhfZU27rU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/leverage-ai-to-optimize-customer-service-outcomes/">Leverage AI to optimize customer service outcomes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Leverage AI to optimize customer service outcomes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/leverage-ai-to-optimize-customer-service-outcomes/embed/#?secret=mFhfZU27rU" data-secret="mFhfZU27rU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company will sport SaaS-like gross margins, Ramineni confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fireflies wants to plug into more and more meeting platforms, and external software. You can currently link your Fireflies account to services like Zapier, Slack and your CRM. Over time, it&#8217;s not hard to see how the startup could take more direct commands from meetings, and help users better distribute, file and recall meeting information.</p>
<p>As someone with too many meetings, and too many notes documents spread out across the wasteland that is my Google Drive account, I get why people are using Fireflies today. But if the startup can build a no-code automation platform on top of my note taking? Then I will probably have to buy its service.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as a final note, working for a Major American Corporation can have its downsides. For example, Ramineni provided TechCrunch with a recording of our interview inside of Fireflies. This was nice, as I prefer to write from both my notes <em>and</em> transcripts to ensure that I am not missing things, or making mistakes. Fireflies kept asking me to log in. I tried with my corporate Google account. Which blocks such log-ins. So I kept getting the same prompt again and again.</p>
<p>Annoying? Sure. Lethal? No.</p>
<p>More when we can squeeze more growth data out of the startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM is leaning into TikTok. The satellite radio company and Pandora parent today announced a partnership with the social video platform to power several new initiatives, including a TikTok channel on SiriusXM, hosted TikTok playlists on Pandora, and re-airings of Pandora LIVE events on TikTok.</p>
<p>The hosted playlists on Pandora are the first of the new initiatives to launch.</p>
<p>Starting today, popular TikTok creators will curate, host and promote their own Pandora playlists to their fans on TikTok, starting with Bella Poarch. The TikTok influencer, who now has 69.6 million followers, is best-known for her viral lip-sync video to &#8220;M to the B,&#8221; which blew up to become <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-poarch-tiktok-tyga-tattoo-navy-age-military-how-old-2020-10#she-first-went-mega-viral-with-her-m-to-the-b-video-which-became-the-most-liked-video-on-tiktok-2">the most-liked video on TikTok</a>. She also makes videos featuring singing, dancing, and gaming content, among other things, and this month <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/tiktok-star-bella-poarch-said-her-new-song-build-a-btch-was-inspired-by-her-experience-of-being-bullied-as-a-child/articleshow/82637923.cms">released her first single</a>, &#8220;Build a B*tch,&#8221; which has broken into Spotify&#8217;s U.S. and Global Top 50 charts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of the time of writing, Poarch&#8217;s TikTok announcing her playlists, launched 4 hours ago, has 187.6K likes and 1 million views.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156510" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156510" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2156510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pandora-TikTok-Tastemakers_Bella-Poarch.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156510" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SiriusXM</p></div></p>
<p>Other &#8220;TikTok Tastemakers,&#8221; as SiriusXM has dubbed them, will release their own playlists in the months to come, including Christian Shelton and Nick Tangorra.</p>
<p>In addition, Pandora users will be able to tune into the <a href="https://www.pandora.com/playlist/PL:844424989710412:1756780791">TikTok Hits Playlist</a> at any time, which features popular and trending songs from TikTok.</p>
<p>Pandora is not the first music streamer to tap into TikTok&#8217;s influence for its own ends. Today, TikTok&#8217;s trends are driving songs up the Billboard charts and delivering Spotify streams as younger users look for their favorite TikTok songs on their preferred streaming music app. Spotify is now curating TikTok hits across editorial playlists like Viral Hits, big on the internet, Teen Beats, and others. Apple Music also got in on the TikTok action when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-music-adds-10-new-playlists-aimed-at-gen-z-including-one-with-tiktok-hits/">introduced 10 new playlists</a> last year aimed at younger, Gen Z users. This included its own Viral Hits playlist, which pulls in top tracks from TikTok and other social media channels.</p>
<p>Among the other SiriusXM initiatives is the soon-to-launch TikTok Radio, a full-time music channel featuring tracks trending on TikTok which will be presented by TikTok creators, influencers and D.J.s. The channel will debut later this summer, and will stream across SiriusXM, including in vehicles as well as in the SiriusXM app for desktop, mobile and connected devices.</p>
<p>TikTok fans will also later be able to watch selected re-airings of Pandora&#8217;s original events series, Pandora LIVE &#8212; a continuation of Pandora&#8217;s live events that went virtual during the pandemic. Pandora LIVE events feature artists from across genres, including country, rock, pop, R&amp;B and more, and have typically been re-aired, in part, the day after on SiriusXM.</p>
<p>Recently, Pandora LIVE celebrated Women&#8217;s History Month with a virtual event that included performances by Gwen Stefani and Jazmine Sullivan, which was re-aired on TikTok.</p>
<p>More Pandora LIVE events will soon do the same. SiriusXM says it will announce which events will re-air on TikTok throughout the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to collaborate with TikTok to create new content that brings the vibrancy of the leading social networking service to life on live radio and our streaming platforms,&#8221; said Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM President and Chief Content Officer, in a statement. &#8220;The effect TikTok has on music, and pop culture in general, is undeniable. Our platforms will provide a unique opportunity for TikTok creators to engage with our listeners with content experiences that have never been done before in audio,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>SiriusXM&#8217;s move to partner more closely with TikTok could help it to attract a younger set of listeners and subscribers, who may follow their favorite fans over to Pandora to tune into their playlist content. However, it&#8217;s unable to benefit from the full impact that working with TikTok could bring as the integrations are split across its two services, instead of being focused on just one.</p>
<p>Plus, SiriusXM, like others, still faces the looming threat of Resso, TikTok owner ByteDance&#8217;s own<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/resso-music-india-bytedance/"> music streaming app</a> that could one day make its way to the U.S., as part of its global expansion efforts. It has the potential to more closely tie TikTok&#8217;s music discovery features with streaming, impacting demand for rival services.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, TikTok sees the potential in partnering with a U.S. music streamer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to work with SiriusXM on TikTok Radio and to bring TikTok creators to Pandora to make the trends, music, and creative influences that are playing such a defining role in modern culture even more accessible,&#8221; said TikTok&#8217;s Global Head of Music, Ole Obermann, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to see this come to life and thank the SiriusXM team for being such an innovative and visionary collaborator,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December, Microsoft wrote a blog post highlighting “The year ahead for Surface Duo.” The news highlighted the dual-screen device’s upcoming availability outside the U.S. (including Canada, the U.K., France and Germany this year), as well as a smattering of features. It’s been pretty well acknowledged from most everyone who reviewed the device (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/microsoft-surface-duo-review/">us included</a>), that it’s very much a work in progress.</p>
<p>After making the feature available in beta, Microsoft today is issuing at update to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> for Android that will unlock some of the product’s entertainment potential. It’s something the company has discussed, and even previewed, but until now, it has remained one of a handful of blind spots.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A very cool update goes live for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SurfaceDuo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SurfaceDuo</a> customers today! Working with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> we&#39;ve put touch controls on to the second screen. More than 50 games are available to play with touch for <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@xboxGamePass</a> Ultimate Members. <a href="https://t.co/ZPIqQZXxS4">pic.twitter.com/ZPIqQZXxS4</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Panos Panay (@panos_panay) <a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1396844093133660173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The app works as you’d expect on the Duo &#8212; displaying the game on the top screen and transforming the bottom into a virtual version of an Xbox controller in the Compose Mode orientation. Obviously you can only go so far on that front with a touchscreen, but gaming is genuinely an application where having a second screen can really come in handy.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-gamepad-xbox-cloud-150042077.html">Engadget notes</a>, there are now more than 50 titles that support Xbox Touch Controls. Those will be available to users with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>A much-hyped &#8212; and eagerly anticipated &#8212; alternative to the foldable form factor, the Duo was a disappointment on launch. The company has since dropped the product’s price from $1,500 to $1,000 &#8212; not exactly a sign that it was selling well &#8212; but continued software support like this is, perhaps, an indication that the company is going to support the line going forward, in spite of early stumbles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Delhi Police, controlled by India&#8217;s central government, on Monday evening raided offices of Twitter in Delhi and Gurgaon as it sought more information on why the social network tagged one of the tweets by ruling partly BJP spokesperson<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/"> as &#8220;manipulated media.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Delhi Police IT Cell team vacated both of Twitter&#8217;s offices because the offices were closed and there were no Twitter employee to engage, many local TV channels reported.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Delhi sent a notice to Twitter last week after the social network <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India’s ruling party BJP, as “manipulated media.”</p>
<p>In the tweet, Patra had claimed that Congress, the leading opposition party in India, was using a so-called “toolkit” to derail the Indian government’s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic. Alt News, a leading fact-checking organization in India, <a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/">debunked Patra’s claim</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Delhi Police Special Cell team returns from Gurgaon after they find the Twitter India offices shut. Apparently there is work from home at <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TwitterIndia</a> since March last year.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Delhi Police is enquiring into a complaint in which clarification is sought from the Twitter regarding the classification of a tweet by Shri Sambit Patra (BJP spokesman) as &#8216;manipulative&#8217;. It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such,&#8221; Delhi Police said in statements to local TV channels and <a href="https://twitter.com/Bhuvanbagga/status/1396841617294823430">other journalists</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information is relevant to the enquiry. Special Cell which is conducting the enquiry wants to find out the truth. Twitter which has claimed to know the underlying truth should clarify,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Several policy executives and the like questioned Delhi Police&#8217;s motives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has a reported valuation over $5 billion and has raised more than $900 million since launch. The restaurant POS service has clearly been on a rapid growth trajectory, but how has the company navigated the market during the pandemic, which has pushed and pulled the restaurant industry unlike ever before?</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Extra Crunch Live (May 26 at 3pm ET</a>), we&#8217;ll find out. We&#8217;re sitting down with president and co-founder of Toast, Aman Narang, and one of the company&#8217;s investors, Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; Kent Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett is a partner out of the Cambridge office, focusing on consumer products and services as well as consumer-facing software. Before venture, Bennett was a creative executive for an entertainment production company called Licht Entertainment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His portfolio includes Bevi, Blue Apron, Xtime and, of course, Toast.</p>
<p>Narang spent seven years at Oracle, then Endeca, working on the development of the company&#8217;s business intelligence platform and mobile commerce platform.</p>
<p>He co-founded Toast in 2011 and has been growing the company ever since, adding new products and features to the restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Narang and Bennett to learn about how they came together for the company&#8217;s Series B deal, which Bessemer led. We&#8217;ll also talk about why Bennett wanted to bet on Toast, how they&#8217;ve worked together since and how they overcome challenges and disagreements. If we&#8217;re lucky, we may even get a peek at Toast&#8217;s original Series B pitch deck.</p>

<p>From there, we&#8217;ll head into the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off. Members of the audience can raise their hand to pitch live on the show, and Bennett and Narang will offer their feedback. It&#8217;s always a good time, but the only way to participate is to show up live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Register here for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a free event and accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members get access to the entire library of ECL episodes, all of which are packed with insights on how to raise and run a successful venture-backed company.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Register to hang out with myself, Narang and Bennett on Wednesday, May 26 at 3pm ET/noon PT.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[With a rising adjusted EBITDA result and improving adjusted EBITDA margins, Zeta has a profit story to tell investors along with possibly accelerating revenue growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to the working week. Are you ready to get our hands a little dirty this morning?</p>
<p>Good. We have an IPO to catch up on, one I should have kept up with in the past few weeks. Regardless, today we&#8217;re looking at Zeta Global&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001851003/000119312521167972/d379381ds1a.htm">IPO filing</a> ahead of its eventual pricing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Zeta Global is not a firm that I am very familiar with, but <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zeta-interactive/company_financials">because Crunchbase notes</a> that the New York-based startup has raised north of $600 million in private capital in the form of both equity financing and debt, it&#8217;s a unicorn worth understanding.</p>
<p>The gist is that Zeta ingests and crunches lots of data, helping its users market to their customers on a targeted basis throughout their individual buying lifecycles. In simpler terms, Zeta helps companies pitch customers in varied manners depending on their own characteristics.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You can imagine that, as the digital economy has grown, the sort of work Zeta Global supports has only expanded. So, has Zeta itself grown quickly? And does it have an attractive business profile? We want to know. We&#8217;ll also poke around its final private valuation so that we can see how much that number matches up &#8212; or doesn&#8217;t &#8212; to its recent financial results.</p>
<p>Sound good? Let&#8217;s find out why Staley Capital, GCP Capital Partners, Franklin Square Group, GPI Capital and others backed the firm.</p>
<h2>Zeta Global&#8217;s business in brief</h2>
<p>It can be useful to dissect a company&#8217;s marketing materials not just to see how well they describe themselves, but also to grok how they want to be perceived in the marketplace. Zeta is one such case.</p>
<p>Via its S-1 filings, here&#8217;s how it wants you to understand its business:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zeta is a leading omnichannel data-driven cloud platform that provides enterprises with consumer intelligence and marketing automation software. We empower our customers to target, connect and engage consumers through software that delivers personalized marketing across all addressable channels, including email, social media, web, chat, connected TV (“CTV”) and video, among others.</p></blockquote>
<p>If that didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense, it&#8217;s OK.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before SoftBank launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/">$2 billion Innovation Fund</a> in Latin America, and before Andreessen Horowitz began actively <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/04/13/latin-america-fintech/">investing in the region</a>, Sao Paulo-based <a href="http://www.kaszek.com">Kaszek</a> has been putting money into promising startups since 2011, helping spawn nine unicorns along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the early-stage VC firm is announcing its largest fund closures to date: Kaszek Ventures V, a $475 million early-stage fund, believed to be the largest vehicle of its kind ever raised in the region, and Kaszek Ventures Opportunity II, a $525 million for later-stage investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Kaszek has backed 91 companies, which the firm says collectively have raised over $10 billion in capital. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With backers like Tiger Global, LatAm crypto exchange Bitso raises $250M at a $2.2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/latam-crypto-exchange-bisto-raises-250m-from-tiger-coatue-at-a-2-2b-valuation/embed/#?secret=2STSOjM8Hd" data-secret="2STSOjM8Hd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MercadoLibre co-founder Hernán Kazah and the company’s ex-CFO, Nicolas Szekasy, founded Kaszek a decade ago after leaving LatAm’s answer to Amazon. Fun fact: the firm’s name comes from a combination of their two last names: Ka-Szek. Rounding out the team are Nicolas Berman, former VP at MercadoLibre, Santiago Fossatti, Andy Young and Mariana Donangelo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek founded its first fund in 2011, raising $95 million, an impressive sum at that time. Funds II and III closed in 2014 and 2017, raising $135 million and $200 million, respectively. By 2019, Kaszek had closed on its fourth fund, raising $375 million and its first Opportunity Fund, reserving $225 million for later-stage investing in existing portfolio companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s notable that in its fifth fund, Kaszek is reserving more of its new capital to fund later-stage investments – a testament to its faith in its current portfolio. Both funds, according to Kaszek, were “several times oversubscribed&#8221; with demand coming globally from university endowments, global foundations, technology funds and several tech entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley-based Sequoia Capital has been an LP since day one via </span><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/heritage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Heritage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its community investment office. Also, Connecticut-based Wesleyan University is an LP with Chief Investment Officer Anne Martin describing the founding team as “internet pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there has been an explosion of global investor interest in Latin American startups. The region’s startup scene is seeing a surge of fundraises, with new unicorns emerging with increasing regularity. And Kaszek has been at the heart of it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been at the epicenter of the technology ecosystem in Latin America since 1999, first with MercadoLibre and now with Kaszek, and have witnessed firsthand the extraordinary  evolution that the sector has experienced since its infancy,” said managing partner and co-founder Kazah. “When MercadoLibre started, the internet penetration was less than 3% and it was mostly dial-up connections. Today, more than two decades later, technology secular trends are stronger than ever before as we are experiencing an acceleration towards digitalization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek has not yet backed any companies out of its newest investment vehicles, but plans to put money in 20 to 30 companies out of its early-stage fund, with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $25 million, according to Kazah. Its Opportunity Fund investments will be more concentrated with the firm likely backing 10 to 15 companies with check sizes ranging from $10 million to $35 million. The firm is industry agnostic, with Kazah saying it considers “any industry where technology is playing a transformational role.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General partner and co-founder Szekasy says that In the firm’s first funds, Kaszek mostly backed first-time entrepreneurs. But in its last early-stage fund, it began backing more teams led by repeat entrepreneurs or by founders spawned out of some of the region’s more successful startups. As many VC firms do, Kaszek describes its investment strategy as providing more than capital, but also becoming partners with the founders of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Creditas founder and CEO Sergio Furio describes the firm as “the co-founder I did not have.”</span></p>
<p>While the firm declined to comment on performance, a source with firsthand knowledge of its metrics over the years tells TechCrunch that it&#8217;s quite impressive with MOICS ranging from 19.2 for Fund I, 10.5 for Fund II, 4.9 for Fund III and 2.6 for Fund IV – with an aggregate IRR for all funds above 55%.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s active <a href="https://www.kaszek.com/companies/">portfolio</a> currently consists of 71 companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek was one of the earliest investors in Brazilian neobank Nubank, just one of 9 unicorns it has helped build over the years. Other unicorns it’s backed include MadeiraMadeira, PedidosYa, proptech startup QuintoAndar, Gympass, Loggi, Creditas, Kavak and Bitso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s investments have largely concentrated in Brazil and Mexico (the two startup hotspots of the region) and Colombia but the firm has also backed startups based in other countries in the region such as DigitalHouse (which was formed in Argentina), NotCo (originally founded in Chile) and Kushki (launched first in Ecuador). It has people on the ground in its home base of Brazil as well as Mexico, the United States, Argentina and Uruguay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have always believed that the strong secular technology trends that we were seeing 20 years ago, evident in the US and a little later in China, were going to happen in Latin America,” Kazah told TechCrunch. “&#8230;Everything we predicted back then was going to happen, happened. Maybe it happened later, but it was also much larger and more comprehensive than what we had initially imagined. That is typically what happens with innovations, they take off later than you think, but fly much higher than you ever imagined.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might have thought that with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">more than 300 companies joining this year’s winter batch of Y Combinator</a>, the investor interest might have thinned. Well, it’s 2021 and investors are hopping around like crazy to invest in ideas that push the boundaries in fields far-flung from enterprise SaaS.</p>
<p>Case in point today: <a href="https://www.gridware.io">Gridware</a>. It’s a startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/gridware-is-building-early-detection-sensors-for-power-grid-failures-and-wildfires/">I profiled earlier this year when it had just started up in its YC batch</a>. As I wrote, it wants to save our power grids from the ravages of climate change:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its approach is to use a small, sensor-laden box that can be installed to a power pole with just four screws. Gridware’s package contains microphones and other sensors to sense the ambient environment around a power pole, and it uses on-board AI/ML processing to listen for anomalies and report them to the relevant managers as appropriate.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hardware, IoT, infrastructure, utilities and government are five keywords you probably most would have wanted to avoid when pitching investors even a few years ago. But with power disappearing in states like California and Texas for stretches of time, investors have perhaps finally realized there is an opportunity to save the planet and make a bit of money here.</p>

<p>Gridware today announced that it has raised $5.3 million in a seed round led by Priscilla Tyler of True Ventures and Seth Bannon and Shu Yang of Fifty Years. CEO and co-founder Tim Barat said fundraising was quite fierce. “We had 130 investors reach out to us, and I wasn’t even able to get back to some of them yet … [I’m] still going back through the emails,” he said. “Even before Demo Day, we had raised a significant portion of our round.”</p>
<p>Barat and the Gridware team were looking for investors who were mission-driven and really understood the timeline it would take to build the company. “You see a lot of investors say they are mission-driven … but when it comes time to put their money where their mouth is, it often goes to consumer technology where it is safer,” he said. Tyler at True leads climate investing for the firm, and True has made a variety of bets in the space. Fifty Years focuses on startups tackling the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">UN’s list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/gridware-is-building-early-detection-sensors-for-power-grid-failures-and-wildfires/">read more about the company’s product and market in my profile from three months ago</a>, but with the new funding, Gridware wants to double down on building a very intentional team capable of tackling this tough market. “Dealing with this multi-stakeholder business model is very challenging, so bringing on people with the experience, knowledge and wits to deal with this kind of environment is key,” Barat said.</p>

<p>As I explored recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">the disaster response space is probably one of the toughest markets in the world to sell into</a>. Barat acknowledged the intrinsic difficulty, but sees huge potential in the long run. “One of the things that I have observed with the companies being successful — they really spend the time to meet as many stakeholders as possible,” he said. “With consumer, you can stand in front of a shopping mall and talk to 100 customers in a day [but] in govtech, getting 100 meetings even within a year is a huge accomplishment.”</p>
<p>The company will be re-opening its Bay Area office in Walnut Creek on June 1.</p>

<div class="contributor-byline__bio">This story was reported in partnership with video surveillance news site <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/hikua-us-map">IPVM.</a></div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">At least a hundred U.S. counties, towns and cities have bought China-made surveillance systems that the U.S. government has linked to human rights abuses, according to contract data seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Some municipalities have spent tens of thousands of dollars or more to buy surveillance equipment made by two Chinese technology companies, Hikvision and Dahua, after the companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">were added</a> to the U.S. government&#8217;s economic blacklist in 2019 after the companies were linked to China&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/">ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities</a> in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live. Congress <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/new-defense-bill-bans-the-u-s-government-from-using-huawei-and-zte-tech/">also banned</a> U.S. federal agencies from buying new Hikvision and Dahua technology or renewing contracts over fears that it could help the Chinese government conduct espionage.</p>
<p>But those federal actions broadly do not apply at the state and city level, allowing local governments to buy these China-made surveillance systems — including video cameras and thermal imaging scanners — largely uninhibited, so long as federal funds are not used to buy the equipment.</p>
<p>Details of the contracts were provided by <a href="https://govspend.com/">GovSpend</a>, which tracks federal and state government spending, to TechCrunch via <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/hikua-us-map">IPVM</a>, a leading news publication on video surveillance, which has followed the Hikvision and Dahua bans closely.</p>
<p>The biggest spender, according to the data and as <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/hik-faye">previously reported by IPVM</a>, showed that the Board of Education in Fayette County, Georgia spent $490,000 in August 2020 on dozens of Hikvision thermal cameras, used for temperature checks at its public schools.</p>
<p>A statement provided by Fayette County Public Schools spokesperson Melinda Berry-Dreisbach said the cameras were purchased from its longtime security vendor, authorized dealer for Hikvision. The statement did not address whether the Board of Education was aware of Hikvision&#8217;s links to human rights abuses. Berry-Dreisbach did not respond to our follow-up questions.</p>
<p>IPVM research <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-26/issue-04/043009/Globally-deployed-COVID-19-fever-screening-devices-using-infrared-thermographs/10.1117/1.JBO.26.4.043009.full?SSO=1&amp;tab=ArticleLinkFigureTable">found</a> many thermal scanners, including Hikvision and Dahua models, produced inaccurate readings, prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue a public health alert warning that misreported readings <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/05/fever-scanner-flaws-covid/">could present</a> &#8220;potentially serious public health risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash County in North Carolina, which has a population of 95,000 residents, spent more than $45,000 between September and December 2020 to buy Dahua thermal cameras. County Manager Zee Lamb forwarded emails that confirmed the purchases and that the gear was deployed at the county&#8217;s public schools, but did not comment.</p>
<p>The data also shows that the Parish of Jefferson in Louisiana, which includes part of the city of New Orleans, spent $35,000 on Hikvision surveillance cameras and video storage between October 2019 and September 2020. A parish spokesperson did not comment.</p>
<p>Only one municipality we contacted addressed the links between the technology they bought and human rights abuses. Kern County in California spent more than $15,000 on Hikvision surveillance cameras and video recording equipment in June 2020 for its probation department offices. The contract data showed a local vendor, Tel Tec Security, supplied the Hikvision technology to the county.</p>
<p>Ryan Alsop, chief administrative officer for Kern County, said he was &#8220;not familiar at all with the issues you&#8217;re referencing with regard to Hikvision,&#8221; when asked about Hikvision&#8217;s links to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, we didn&#8217;t contract with Hikvision, we contracted with Tel Tec Security,&#8221; said Alsop.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the City of Hollywood in Florida, which spent close to $30,000 on Hikvision thermal cameras, said the Chinese technology maker &#8220;was the only major manufacturer with a viable solution that was ready for delivery; would serve the defined project scope; and was within the project budget.&#8221; The cameras were used to take employees&#8217; body temperatures to curb the spread of COVID-19. The spokesperson did not address the links to human rights abuses but noted that the federal ban did not apply to the city.</p>
<p>Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said a lack of privacy regulations at the local level contributed to municipalities buying this technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the problems is that these kinds of cameras, regardless of the country of origin and regardless of whether or not they&#8217;re even linked to human rights abuses, have been introduced to various parts of the country — especially at state and city levels — without any kind of regulation to ensure that they comply with privacy standards,&#8221; said Wang in a call. &#8220;There is, again, no kind of regulatory framework to vet the companies based on their track record, whether or not they have abused human rights in their practices, such that we can evaluate or choose better companies, and encourage the ones with better privacy protections to win, essentially.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chief among the U.S. government&#8217;s allegations are that Beijing has relied heavily on Hikvision, Dahua and others to supply the surveillance technology it uses to monitor the Uighur population as part of the government&#8217;s ongoing efforts to suppress the ethnic group, which it has repeatedly denied.</p>
<p>United Nations watchdogs say Beijing has detained more than a million Uighurs in internment camps in recent years as part of these efforts, which led to the U.S. blacklisting of the two surveillance technology makers.</p>
<p>In adding the companies to the government&#8217;s economic blacklist, the Commerce Department said Hikvision and Dahua &#8220;have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.&#8221; The Biden administration <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/">called</a> the human rights abuses a &#8220;genocide.&#8221;</p>
<p>IPVM has also reported extensively on how the companies&#8217; surveillance technology has been used to suppress the Uighurs. Dahua was found to have <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/dahua-uyghur-warning">race detection in its code</a> for providing &#8220;real-time Uighur warnings&#8221; to police.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Thomson Reuters Foundation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-tech-china/exclusive-half-london-councils-found-using-chinese-surveillance-tech-linked-to-uighur-abuses-idUSKBN2AI0QJ">found half of London&#8217;s councils</a> and the largest 20 U.K. cities were using the technology linked to Uighur abuses. The Guardian also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/21/chinese-spy-tech-firm-linked-uighur-abuses-increases-uk-presence">found</a> that Hikvision surveillance technology was used in U.K. schools.</p>
<p>When reached, Dahua pointed to <a href="https://us.dahuasecurity.com/?page_id=60083">a blog post</a> with a statement, and claimed that &#8220;contrary to some reporting in the media, our company has never developed any technology or solution that seeks to target a specific ethnic group.&#8221; The statement added: &#8220;Claims to the contrary are simply false and we are aware of no evidence that has ever been put forward to support such claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hikvision did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile app market intelligence firm Sensor Tower has made its first acquisition. The company this morning announced it&#8217;s acquiring Pathmatics, a market intelligence company which will now combine its paid digital and social media platform with Sensor Tower&#8217;s business. Deal terms were not detailed but include an undisclosed growth investment from Riverwood Capital into Pathmatics.</p>
<p>The acquisition will allow the companies to offer an expanded set of digital and mobile advertising insights to their respective customers, including new social insights for TikTok, YouTube mobile, and Snap this year, powered by Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>They companies will also introduce digital TV (over-the-top) insights, expanded coverage for mobile apps and ad insights, and will extend Pathmatics&#8217; social and digital coverage globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal follows Sensor Tower&#8217;s first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/sensor-tower-raises-45m-as-demand-for-app-data-grows/">significant fundraising last year</a>, with $45 million also from Riverwood Capital. Though Sensor Tower had been profitable since its launch, now serving more than 350 enterprise-level customers for its app and ad intelligence products, it chose to raise the additional capital in order to further grow its business, with investments in hiring, marketing, infrastructure and other expansions.</p>
<p>With Pathmatics, it&#8217;s buying a company that&#8217;s also been on its way up. The company had seen over 100% year-over-year growth for its own market intelligence business since launching in 2011. It now has over 250 brands, media and advertising agencies as customers, as well as over 7,000 users of its platform, representing over 200% software-as-a-service growth since 2018.</p>
<p>The two businesses are teaming up at a time when digital advertising is also on the rise, in part due to the shifts in the market attributed to the pandemic. As more businesses began operating online last year, advertisers increased their digital ad spending by 12.7% to $368 billion, per eMarketer. And digital advertising will account for 58% of media spending in 2021.</p>
<p>We understand Sensor Tower acquired both the IP and its over 60-person team from Pathmatics as a result of the acquisition. The entire team will join Sensor Tower with the executive suite now being a combination of both of the company&#8217;s leaders. Sensor Tower co-founder Alexey Malafeev will remain as CEO while Gabe Gottlieb, CEO and co-founder of Pathmatics, will become Chief Strategy Officer.</p>
<p>Historically, Pathmatics had provided brands and agencies with all creative used by advertisers, spend and impression, and path to publisher and viewer, to help them reduce waste from their budgets, improve their own marketing, and predict their competitors&#8217; next move.</p>
<p>Going forward, both sets of customers will be able to opt into the other company&#8217;s solutions, including mobile, social media, and digital insights. Longer-term, the two companies will work together to bring more products to the market for their over 600 combined customers across 50 countries. Among these is a plan to add Pathmatics&#8217; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other digital ad intelligence capture into Sensor Tower, as well as an effort to augment Sensor Tower&#8217;s dataset with ad insights beyond app installs.</p>
<p>These features will make the product a better fit for larger brands looking into all aspects of the competitors&#8217; campaigns, ranging from how they&#8217;re advertising for app installs to how they&#8217;re building brand awareness.</p>
<p>The deal officially closed on May 17, 2021, Sensor Tower says.</p>
<p>Santa Monica-based Pathmatics had raised $7.7 million to date from Upfront Ventures, BDMI and Baroda Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the global economy increasingly shifts to digital, it&#8217;s imperative that companies can understand and<br />
navigate the entire digital landscape &#8212; from mobile to web and desktop &#8212; using accurate and insightful data,&#8221; noted Ramesh Venugopal, Principal at Riverwood Capital, in a statement about the acquisition. &#8220;The combination of Sensor Tower and Pathmatics presents a unique and valuable offering to customers allowing them to take advantage of a broad range of datasets with increased focus on consumer privacy and deep digital insights that leaders in every industry will need,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile landing page builder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/beacons-debuts-a-link-in-bio-mobile-website-builder-that-helps-creators-make-money-not-just-list-links/">Beacons</a> has raised $6 million seed round to expand its vision for empowering creators to make money beyond the cramped confines of their social media profiles. The company, co-founded by Neal Jean, Jesse Zhang, Greg Luppescu and David Zeng, provides anyone who uses social media a single, mobile-optimized link hub to display to their followers.</p>
<p>Like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/"> competitor Linktree</a>, <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a> gives people a way to link out to other sites directly from their TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter profile, including pointing followers toward potential income streams like donations and affiliate links. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies in the “link in bio” space include </span><a href="https://dash.shorby.com/smartpage?&amp;lp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://milkshake.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milkshake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://tap.bio/@tap.bio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap.bio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://linkinprofile.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link in Profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://bio.fm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bio.fm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://campsite.bio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campsite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Beacons launched in private beta in September 2020 after emerging out of Y Combinator’s Summer 2019 cohort. Andreessen Horowitz will lead the seed round and is joined by <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/team">Atelier Ventures</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/the-chainsmokers-just-closed-their-debut-venture-fund-mantis-with-35-million/">The Chainsmokers’ Mantis Fund</a>, Night Media Ventures and LOUDgg, the Brazilian esports group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $6 million seed round will build on $600,000 that Beacons raised in an angel round, allowing the team to hire more engineers and designers to grow its small four-person team of first-time founders.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think where we&#8217;re really different than Linktree is we let creators customize and personalize their pages all for free and we offer a lot more of those options on our free plan,” Beacons co-founder and CEO Neal Jean told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Creators care a lot about how their website looks so that&#8217;s been a good way for us to give creators the features that they want and help us grow our share in the market too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep creators locked into their own platforms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">forthcoming monetization schemes</a>, social media companies don’t offer much support for embedded links, particularly on individual pieces of content. Many also restrict users to one URL in their profiles, putting pressure on creators to maximize the utility of a single link. Beacons reasonably argues that the restrictive design of most social platforms stunts the ability of creators to easily and flexibly make money from their content.</span></p>
<p>“In the beginning we’re basically building all these different kinds of features for creators to use but I think in the long run the way to make that more scalable is to turn into more of a platform or an ecosystem that lots of people can build on,” Jean said.</p>
<p>“Today, I think we’re probably more like a Wix or a Squarespace for content creators, but in the future I think we want to be a little bit more like Shopify for creators.”</p>

<h3>Building on Beacons</h3>
<p>Beacons lets users choose between free and premium tiers. At $10 per month, the “entrepreneur” tier offers a couple of killer features worth considering, including support for custom domains and additional “blocks” — the link, text and image slots that comprise a Beacons page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg 1370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Beyond premium pricing, Beacons makes money by taking a cut of sales through its handful of monetization-focused blocks, like a shopping-enabled TikTok feed, a digital storefront for videos and ebooks, and a “requests” block that lets creators sell custom content directly to their followers. Beacons’ free plan charges a 9% fee on transactions, while the premium plan cuts that down to 5%.</p>
<p>Landing sites built through Beacons are deeply customizable, hearkening back to the MySpace era of media-rich, curated homepages. The company recently added what it calls the “community block,” a designated place where creators can highlight collaborators they might team up with often on a collab-obsessed platform like TikTok. The company currently counts Sia, Green Day and Russell Brand among its high profile users.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beacons also supports mobile marketing through email and SMS and analytics to help creators understand their audiences. The company says that its user base has grown by 70% every month since its October launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s content creators and consumers have more sophisticated expectations than existing social platforms allow,” Jean said in the funding announcement. “&#8230;With Beacons, creators can control their destiny by directing online traffic to a custom domain that looks awesome, is shareable and ultimately generates revenue.” </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I want to point to two Extra Crunch articles before jumping into the rest of the news and analysis. Yes, Extra Crunch requires a subscription. We&#8217;re ramping up the transportation analysis and features in EC and I hope you find it worthwhile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re ramping up our founder Q&amp;A series. The first one was an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/revels-frank-reig-shares-how-he-built-his-business-and-what-hes-planning/"><strong>Revel</strong> founder and CEO Frank Reig</a>. This time, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing/"><strong>Arrival</strong> founder Denis Sverdlov</a>, who founded his first company at 22 selling IT consulting software to enterprise customers. Since then, he has built and exited multiple companies, most notably telecommunications operator Yota Group. He also founded Roborace.</p>
<p>We have two more interviews coming up with <strong>Veo</strong> co-founder and CEO Candice Xie and <strong>Refraction AI</strong> co-founder Matthew Johnson-Roberson.</p>
<p>Finally, we published a piece that examines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/the-battle-for-voice-recognition-inside-vehicles-is-heating-up/">voice recognition in vehicles</a>, a marketplace that has tech giants like Google and Amazon competing for space with a few up and comers and established suppliers like Cerence.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Dott</strong>, <strong>Lime</strong> and <strong>TIER</strong> have won the long-awaited, much-coveted bid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/">operate e-scooter shares in London</a>. The pilot, which will run for up to 12 months, will begin June 7 in some of London&#8217;s boroughs, including Canary Wharf and the City of London. More neighborhoods are expected to join as the year progresses, according to TfL. Lambeth and Southwark are also seeking participation. Between 60 to 150 scooters will be available initially in each borough.</p>
<p>This announcement is significant not only because London is one of the biggest targets for micromobility shares, but also because Transport for London is very keen on collecting data from the scooter companies that will help determine how e-scooters could be integrated into a sustainable transport pandemic recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Can micromobility address the racial wealth gap?</h3>
<p>The Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation released a report entitled <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cdef00e5-a376-4223-ad27-4d242abcbee8#pageNum=1">Cementing an Equity Framework for Micro Mobility</a> that talks about next steps for its NYC Better Bike Share Partnership and outlines goals for fostering equity and opportunity for communities of color through public transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a truly equitable bikeshare system is about more than just placement of stations and the price of fares. It requires deep partnerships with the community and empowering the voices of those who have been traditionally underserved,&#8221; said Laura Fox, General Manager of Citi Bike. &#8220;We are grateful to the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation for their leadership and ongoing efforts to create a culture of cycling, particularly by addressing street safety. As this progress report highlights, we have many accomplishments to be proud of and we look forward to continued partnership to build on these successes.&#8221;<br />
Accessible mobility is one of the major drivers of wealth, and I&#8217;m a big proponent of the potential for active forms of mobility, from e-scooters to push bikes and everything in between, to both help cities cut emissions and help residents stay healthy.</p>
<p>From a startup&#8217;s perspective, can you even contribute to this equitable goal and also make money? I&#8217;ll be discussing this in a few weeks at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/announcing-the-agenda-for-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Mobility Event on June 9</a> with advocate and consultant Tamika Butler, CEO and co-founder at Remix, Tiffany Chu, and CEO and co-founder of Revel, Frank Reig.</p>
<h3>Spinning tales of SPACs&#8230;</h3>
<p>The aftereffects of Bird going SPAC last week is that now we&#8217;re all wondering which micromobility company is going to go SPAC next. Will it be Lime? TIER? Or maybe Spin? Bloomberg reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin"> Ford is considering divesting Spin</a>, according to &#8220;people familiar with the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, we have a lot of whisperings and speculation and not a lot of facts. Rumors circulating involve Spin spinning off from Ford or merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Spin did not want to comment, and I think that&#8217;s fair given the nebulous shape of this &#8220;news.&#8221;</p>
<h3>While we&#8217;re on the subject of Bird&#8230;</h3>
<p>Bird is working with IT Asset Partners (ITAP) to give its batteries a second life. So, when a scooter reaches the end of its life, it&#8217;s broken down for parts, with batteries shipped over to ITAP. Then ITAP breaks down each battery module to the cellular level to get as many reusable battery bits as possible.</p>
<p>This is not only an eco-friendly way to do business, but it&#8217;s also increasingly necessary in a world that&#8217;s going electric faster than supply can keep up with.</p>
<p>&#8220;The circular economy is where the world is going, and it will help determine how global businesses function over the next 10 years,&#8221; said Robert Mullaney, Director of Business Development at ITAP, in a <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/how-bird-itap-reducing-battery-waste-through-advanced-recycling/">Bird blog post announcing the partnership</a>. &#8220;As battery technology has improved year over year, their second life potential has increased as well, allowing them to be used in broader and more advanced applications. This includes things like computers and computer chargers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it me or am I seeing more activity in the aviation/eVTOL sector these days? We&#8217;ve had three SPACs — Lillium, Archer and Joby — plus a smattering of other funding news in the past four months.</p>
<p>And now, there&#8217;s one more to add to the list. Electric aviation startup <strong>Beta Technologies</strong> closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">$368 million Series A funding round</a> with investments from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund. The new capital is the second round of funding announced by the company this year, after the company raised $143 million in private capital in March. Beta&#8217;s valuation is now at $1.4 billion, putting it in a small circle of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) unicorns.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with undisclosed additions from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion fund established in September 2019 to advance the development of sustainable technologies. The Climate Pledge fund has also made contributions toward electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian, battery recycler Redwood Materials and ZeroAvia, a hydrogen fuel cell aviation company.</p>
<p>Beta is a bit different from other high valuation eVTOL startups. The Vermont-based company isn&#8217;t primarily focused on air taxis. Instead, it&#8217;s been targeting defense applications, cargo delivery and medical logistics, as well as building out its network of rapid-charging systems in the northeast U.S. Its debut aircraft, the ALIA-250c, was built to serve these various solutions by being capable of carrying six people or a pilot and 1,500 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mile Auto</strong>, insurance tech startup, raised $10.3 million in a seed funding round that includes investment from Ulu Ventures, Emergent Ventures, Thornton Capital, and Sure Ventures. The company said it will use the funding to expand availability of its insurance offering to half of the U.S. auto insurance market by the end of 2021, as well as hiring, adding new distribution channels, onboarding of white-label partners and expanding its automaker network. Mile Auto has also partnered with Ford Motor to offer auto insurance to owners. Mile Auto launched a similar program with Porsche Financial Services in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Portside</strong>, an aviation startup that is building a platform for managing the backend of a corporate flight department, charter operation, government fleet and fractional ownership operation, today announced that it has raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/portside-raises-17m-for-its-business-aviation-management-platform/">$17 million funding round</a> led by Tiger Global Management, with participation from existing investors I2BF Global Ventures and SOMA Capital.</p>
<p><strong>Twaice</strong>, the German battery analytics software company, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/twaice-raised-26m-to-scale-its-battery-analytics-software/">$26 million in Series B funding</a> led by Chicago-based Energize Ventures. The company, which primarily works in the mobility and energy storage industries, now has a total financing of $45 million.</p>
<p><strong>Virtuo</strong>, a Paris-based startup that lets people rent a car for a few days, or up to a few months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/virtuo-raises-96m-for-its-streamlined-take-on-car-rentals/">has raised $96 million</a>. The funding money will be using to invest in its tech and to expand to more markets beyond France, U.K. and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Waybridge</strong>, a company that has created a supply chain platform for raw materials, raised $30 million in a Series B funding round co-led by Rucker Park Capital and Craft Ventures, with participation from Venrock. The company has developed a digital platform that lets customers track inventory and shipments. Waybridge&#8217;s pitch is that its product can help companies navigate disruptive events like the Suez Canal traffic jam and COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>WeaveGrid</strong> raises <a href="https://www.weavegrid.com/blog">$15 million Series A round</a> to enable widescale adoption of EVs on the electric grid. Coatue and Breakthrough Energy Ventures will join existing investors to drive software innovation at intersection of utility and automotive sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Wejo</strong>, the British automotive-data startup backed by General Motors, is in talks to go public through a merger with Virtuoso Acquisition Corp., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-21/gm-backed-wejo-said-to-be-in-spac-merger-talks-with-virtuoso?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner! A decision from a little-known but very powerful California regulator caught my eye this week. The <strong>California Air Resources Board</strong>, which regulates air quality in the state, adopted new rules on Thursday that will require 90% of ride-share trips to be completed by electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft have both vowed to go 100% electric fleets by that year, but this is the first time that a state has adopted EV requirements for ride-share companies. In written comments submitted ahead of the hearing, both Uber and Lyft urged the Board to create EV rebates that are specifically targeted at high-mileage drivers and fleets, and to install EV chargers in &#8220;urban and traditionally underserved areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;California&#8217;s EV incentive programs and EV infrastructure investments over the past decade have served an exclusive population―wealthy, white, homeowners―that does not reflect Lyft&#8217;s driver population,&#8221; Paul Augustine, Lyft&#8217;s senior manager of sustainability, <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/lists/com-attach/7-cleanmilesstandard-VzZTIFQyAiQGcwF1.pdf">said in submitted comments</a>.</p>
<p>Back over in Washington, there was a hearing at the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-promises-and-perils-the-potential-of-automobile-technologies">House Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> about the ways in which new automotive technologies (like autonomous driving) might enhance vehicle safety and help cut down on the many thousands of automotive deaths that occur on U.S. roads each year.</p>
<p>AV proponents like the Self Driving Coalition point to the many possible safety benefits of AVs. Electrical engineer Ragunathan Rajkumar, who testified at the meeting, urged lawmakers to advance a policy framework to support innovation to ensure America stays competitive against foreign rivals in AV technology.</p>
<p>However, the committee also heard testimony from people who urged a careful and pragmatic approach to AVs. Greg Regan, in testimony representing the AFL-CIO, argued that transportation workers should have a place at the table in conversations about AV deployment. He also said that the government should enact policy to ensure that the AV manufacturing industry yields secure jobs for American workers. Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, argued that other safety and design upgrades, as well as improved vehicle performance standards, could do much to save lives in the near-term.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that tens of thousands of unproven and unregulated AVs deployed quickly and without oversight, or a significant upgrade in highway and road infrastructure, will automatically be safer than what we have now may make for a good talking point in a quarterly earnings report &#8212; but is not good transportation policy,&#8221; he said in his testimony.</p>
<p>The issue of forced arbitration also came up during the hearing. Below is an exchange between Congressman Rush and Jason Levine, who is the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH</strong>: As you know, even pedestrians may lose their right to seek justice in the courts if there is a continued proliferation of forced arbitration clauses. These clauses are often buried in terms of service agreements that waive a consumer&#8217;s right to sue in court, participate in a class action, or appeal the arbitrator&#8217;s decision. Do forced arbitration clauses related to AVs pose a danger to pedestrians? If so, why?</p>
<p><strong>LEVINE</strong>: They pose a real threat. The threat is this, as we discussed earlier, the ability to make sure you&#8217;re holding any manufacturer, AV or otherwise, responsible for something defective, a defective vehicle, is critical to safety, it is a backstop to our entire system. And so, if you are a pedestrian who has entered into an agreement unknowingly, when you downloaded an app to order a pizza maybe, and you get hit by a pizza delivery vehicle, and you said, &#8220;well I&#8217;m going to do everything from a legal standpoint through binding arbitration,&#8221; you have now lost your ability to go to court. That sounds outlandish, but it&#8217;s not actually that far from where we are in terms of binding arbitration removing our ability to hold manufacturers accountable. So that&#8217;s something that we do not want to see in an AV context.</p>
<p>Station readers: what do you think?</p>

<p>Lots to get to this week.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>May Mobility</strong> announced it is launching a new autonomous shuttle service in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The free shuttle service called A2GO will be available to the public starting Oct. 11, 2021. May Mobility said it will operate a fleet of five autonomous, shared, on-demand vehicles as part of the A2GO deployment. Four hybrid-electric Lexus RX 450h vehicles, which can carry three passengers, and one Polaris GEM fully electric vehicle that has capacity for one wheelchair passenger will operate in a service area that connects Kerrytown, the University of Michigan campus and the State Street corridor.</p>
<p>Chinese robotaxi startup <strong>Pony.ai</strong> has been given permission by California regulators to pilot its autonomous vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/">without a human safety driver behind the wheel</a> in three cities. While dozens of companies &#8212; 55 in all &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it&#8217;s far less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony is the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies <strong>AutoX</strong>, <strong>Baidu</strong> and <strong>WeRide</strong> as well as U.S. businesses <strong>Cruise</strong>, <strong>Nuro</strong>, <strong>Waymo</strong> and <strong>Zoox</strong>. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p>It was a big week for EVs, and not just because of the Ford F-150 Lightning reveal. Although that was certainly the biggest EV reveal.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong> had a fun and brief look at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/a-brief-look-at-electric-vehicles-from-the-dawn-of-the-automobile-age/">electric vehicles in the beginning of the automotive age</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong> gave a few more details of its electric microbus-slash-van, which will be available to buy in 2022 at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/">base price of $34,750</a> before tax incentives or add-ons. The Los Angeles-based company, which debuted on the Nasdaq public exchange earlier this year, now taking preorders in the United States for the &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. While Canoo did not release pricing for the other two vehicles, it said that deliveries for the pickup and production for the delivery van are slated to start as early as 2023. Customers can reserve a model by placing a $100 deposit per vehicle with the company.</p>
<p>The company also disclosed in a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoo-is-being-investigated-by-the-sec/">it is being investigated</a> by the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, just months after its merger with special purpose acquisition company <strong>Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp</strong>. The investigation is broad, covering the Hennessy&#8217;s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company&#8217;s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company&#8217;s officers, according to its first quarter earnings report. Canoo learned of the investigation on April 29. Canoo noted in the regulatory filing. The company added that it does not consider the investigation or other lawsuits it is facing to be material to its business.</p>
<p><strong>ElectReon</strong>, an inductive in-road charging technology for commercial and passenger electric vehicles, is joining the &#8220;Arena of the Future&#8221; project in Brescia, Italy where it will integrate its wireless technology to charge two Stellantis vehicles, and an IVECO bus while driving. The project aims to demonstrate contactless charging for a range of EVs as they drive on highways and toll roads as a potential pathway to decarbonizing our transportation systems along motorway transport corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> had a a few EV news items coinciding with the F-150 Lightning reveal. First, there was the truck&#8217;s debut, which is arguably its most important new product in years and a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $22 billion investment into electrification. This is a challenging vehicle for Ford. As I noted in my coverage, the truck will need everything that has made its gas-powered counterpart the best-selling vehicle in North America as well as new benefits that come from going electric. That means torque, performance, towing capability and the general layout has to meet the needs of its customers, many of whom use it for commercial purposes. The vehicle specs suggest that Ford has delivered on the torque and power, while keeping the same cab and bed dimensions as its gas counterpart.</p>
<p>We ran a poll the night of the reveal asking folks &#8220;which electric truck is for you?&#8221; The choices and results were 37% picked the Ford F-150 Lightning, 19.6% choose <strong>Rivian</strong> R1T and 43.4% said they&#8217;ll hodl the <strong>Tesla</strong> Cybertruck.</p>

<p>Ford is offering one item that some customers might find appealing. Ford said its new F-150 Lightning truck, which will come to market in spring 2022, can provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-can-power-your-home-in-an-outage/">energy to a customer&#8217;s home</a> in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford also announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with <strong>SK Innovation</strong> to establish a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/"> joint venture to manufacture batteries</a> for electric vehicles in the United States. The new venture, dubbed BlueOvalSK, will produce around 60 GWh annually starting mid-decade. The MOU is the latest sign that Ford intends to vertically develop its battery capabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, the Verge interviewed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview">Ford CEO Jim Farley</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <strong>Ford</strong> revealed Monday morning the 2022 F-150 Lightning Pro, a version of the truck designed with <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">commercial customers in mind</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kia</strong>, which held its U.S.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/kias-fast-charging-ev6-electric-crossover-is-coming-to-the-u-s-in-early-2022/"> reveal of the the Kia EV6</a>, an all-electric crossover that is supposed to kick off the automaker&#8217;s Plan S strategy to shift away from internal combustion engines and toward EVs. The EV6, one of 11 electric vehicles that Kia plans to deliver globally by 2026. will come to the U.S. early next year. It&#8217;s also the first dedicated battery-electric vehicle to be built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, which is shared with Hyundai and Genesis as part of the <strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini</strong> announced it is going to eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/lamborghini-is-kicking-off-its-electrification-plan-with-two-gas-powered-super-sports-cars/">electrify its portfolio</a>, although it is taking a slow road to get there. The will first pay homage to combustion engines with the introduction of two new V12 luxury sports cars this year before it makes a push into electrification. The aim is to switch its full lineup of vehicles to hybrids by the end of 2024 and launch of an all-electric Lamborghini in the second half of the decade. The company said it plans to invest 1.5 billion euros ($1.82 billion) over four years to make the transition to hybrid vehicles, the largest allocation in its history.</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p><strong>Volocopter</strong> revealed a new electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft targeting the suburban-to-city commuter. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/volocopter-debuts-a-bigger-evtol-aimed-at-the-city-suburban-commute/">four-seater VoloConnect</a>, which is designed to have a range of 62 miles, is a significant departure from short urban trip aircraft called VoloCity. The two-seat VoloCity, which has to be certified, has a 22-mile range.</p>
<p>VoloConnect&#8217;s longer range indicates that the company has its sights set on markets outside of major city centers, and that it is looking to more directly compete with rival eVTOL startups. VoloConnect&#8217;s aircraft specs are in line with that of competitors <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> and <strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, which each have eVTOL designs with an anticipated range of around 60 miles.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, the startup filed a motion for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">preliminary injunction</a> in its ongoing lawsuit with rival electric air travel startup Archer Aviation. The injunction could put a wrench in Archer&#8217;s operations should the courts approve it. Wisk has asked the court to immediately prohibit Archer from using 52 trade secrets that it alleges were stolen by former employees who were later hired by Archer. The trade secrets &#8220;span the gamut of systems within the aircraft and processes for development,&#8221; a Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p>The <strong>Google I/O developer conference</strong> contained a few vehicle related announcements, including that it is extending its Android for Cars App Library, which is available as part of Jetpack, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-it-easier-to-bring-android-apps-to-your-car/">support the Android Automotive operating system</a>. This is good news for developers who can now create an app that is compatible with two different, but sometimes overlapping platforms: Android OS and Android Auto. It also means developers can create one app that should work seamlessly between various makes and models of vehicles. The company is already working with so-called Early Access Partners, which includes <strong>Parkwhiz</strong>, <strong>Plugshare</strong>, <strong>Sygic</strong>, <strong>ChargePoint</strong>, <strong>Flitsmeister</strong>, <strong>SpotHero</strong> and others to bring apps in these categories to cars powered by Android Automotive OS.</p>
<p>Google also announced it is working with <strong>BMW</strong> and other automakers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/with-android-12-google-will-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-car-key/">develop a digital key</a> that will let car owners lock, unlock and start a vehicle from their Android smartphone. The digital car keys will become available on select Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones later this year. Google didn&#8217;t name the other automakers that it is working with, but the folks there tell me it will be available in some 2021 models and a number of 2022 model vehicles. My educated guess, based on the companies it is already working with, is that Volvo and GM brands will get the digital key.</p>
<p><strong>HERE Technologies</strong>, the location data and technology platform, will power the in-vehicle Human-Machine Interface (HMI) navigation solution in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232153/0/en/Arrival-selects-HERE-SDK-for-its-Electric-Vehicles.html">Arrival&#8217;s upcoming electric vehicles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Holoride</strong>, the Audi spinoff that&#8217;s creating an in-vehicle XR passenger entertainment experience, is deploying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/holoride-deploys-elrond-blockchain-and-nfts-in-prep-for-2022-market-launch/">blockchain technology and NFTs</a> as the next stage in its preparation for a 2022 market launch. The company said it is integrating Elrond blockchain into its tech stack to bring transparency to its ecosystem of car manufacturers and content creators. The aim is to use NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, to incentivize developers into creating more content on holoride&#8217;s platform for the promise of more money earned off token purchases, and to attract passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis </strong>and <strong>Foxconn</strong> have <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22698&amp;mid=1">formed a joint venture</a> called Mobile Drive to supply in-car and connected-car technologies. The non-binding agreement is meant to speed up the time it takes to develop and deploy in-vehicle user experiences enabled by advanced consumer electronics, HMI interfaces and services, according to the companies.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>After a somewhat quiet weekend, things are kicking off in rapid-fire fashion this week. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cryptocurrency selloff that was in full-swing on Friday continued over the weekend. Though bitcoin and ether managed to recoup some of their losses since they set new local minima, the value of popular cryptos is vastly depressed compared to recent highs.</li>
<li>Looking ahead, it&#8217;s the final day of arguments at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games vs. Apple trial</a>. And we&#8217;re seeing a smaller company try to crack some of the hold that a major tech incumbent enjoys over a huge piece of the digital economy. So, if you like startups, you might want to put aside your Apple fandom for a minute.</li>
<li>More than a few funding rounds are cracking off this morning, including neat rounds from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">African fintech Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-unicorn-softbank/">India-and-UAE-based Zeta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/emitwise-raises-an-extra-3-2m-from-arctern-ventures-for-its-greenhouse-gas-emissions-platform/">Emitwise raising $3.2 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/aurora-solar-aims-to-power-the-growing-solar-industry-with-a-250m-round-c/">Aurora Solar raising $250 million</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a busy funding market and a yet-busy IPO cycle, it should be yet another busy week. Strap in!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;AI is eating the world of education,&#8221; <a href="https://company.riiid.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riiid</a> co-founder and CEO YJ Jang notes in his biographical description on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yj-young-jun-jang-6b4a3111/?originalSubdomain=kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, and today his startup &#8212; which builds AI-based personalized learning, including test prep, for students &#8212; is announcing a major funding round to help it position itself as a player in that process.</p>
<p>Seoul-based Riiid has closed a funding round of $175 million, an equity round coming from a single backer, SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The funding is coming at a high-watermark moment for edtech &#8212; with the shift to remote learning in the last year of pandemic living highlighting the opportunity to build better tools to serve that market, and a number of startups in the category subsequently raising hundreds of millions of dollars to tackle the opportunity. Riiid plans to use the investment both to expand its footprint internationally, a well as to expand its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Riiid is not disclosing its valuation, but this round is its biggest yet and brings the total raised by the startup to $250 million, a significant sum in the world of edtech.</p>
<p>Riiid has primarily made a name for itself through Santa, a test prep app geared towards people in non-English-language countries to practice and prepare to take the TOEIC English language proficiency exam (often a requirement to apply to English-language universities if you&#8217;re not a native English speaker), which has been used by more than 2.5 million students in Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>It has also been partnering with third parties to expand into test prep for other exams. These have included the GMAT (in partnership with Kaplan) for Korean students; an app, in partnership with <a href="https://connecme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConnecME Education</a> (a company that tailors educational services specifically to cater to international audiences) to help people in Egypt, UAE, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan <a href="https://www.intelligentcio.com/me/2021/03/26/riiid-labs-and-connecme-launch-ai-enabled-act-test-preparation-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for the ACT</a>; and a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riiid-labs-signs-usd-three-million-contract-with-latin-american-education-leaders-grupo-inicie-and-casa-grande-to-deliver-personalized-ai-powered-learning-301255767.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> deal</a> to build AI-based tools for students in Latin America to prepare for their college entrance exams. The ACT development comes after Riiid said that the former CEO of ACT, Marten Roorda, was joining its international arm Riiid Labs as its &#8220;executive in residence,&#8221; so that could point to more ACT prep applications for other markets, too.</p>
<p>Beyond university entrance tests, Riiid has also been building apps for vocational education, with Santa Realtor for preparing for real estate agency exams, and a test preparation tool for insurance agent exams, both in Korea.</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a time when edtechs are seeing more business and a rise in overall credibility and urgency to fill the gap left by the temporary cessation of in-person learning. The extra element of bringing artificial intelligence into the equation is not unique: a number of companies are bringing in advances in computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning to bring more personalized experiences into what might otherwise appear like a one-size-fits-all model. What is notable here is that Riiid has also been anchoring a lot of its R&amp;D in IP. The company says it has applied for 103 domestic and international patents, and has so far had 27 of them issued.</p>
<p class="p1">“Riiid wants to transform education with AI, and achieve a true democratization of educational opportunities,” said Riiid CEO YJ Jang in a statement. “This investment is only the beginning of our journey in creating a new industry ecosystem and we will carry out this mission with global partnerships.&#8221;</p>
<p>For SoftBank, this is one of the firm&#8217;s bigger edtech investments &#8212; others have included Kahoot (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$215 million</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unacademy</a> in India, and <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/PressRelease/67234/MoFo-Advises-SoftBank-On-Investment-In-Brazilian-EdTech-Company-Descomplica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Descomplica</a> in Brazil. Riiid said that this round is SoftBank&#8217;s first specifically in the area of AI built for educational applications.</p>
<p>“Riiiid is driving a paradigm shift in education, from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to personalized instruction. Powered by AI and machine learning, Riiid’s platform provides education companies, schools and students with personalized plans and tools to optimize learning potential,” said Greg Moon, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We are delighted to partner with YJ and the Riiid team to support their ambition of democratizing quality education around the world.”</p>

<p>Melbourne-based <a href="https://www.littlebirdie.com.au/">Little Birdie</a>, an e-commerce startup that wants to become the “new homepage of online shopping,” won’t launch until next month, but it’s already scored a major investor. <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/">Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)</a>, the <a href="ttps://theaufinance.com/top-banks-in-australia">largest of Australia’s “Big Four” banks</a>, has poured $30 million AUD (about $23.2 million USD) in pre-launch funding into Little Birdie, and will also integrate its shopping content, including exclusive offers, into its consumer banking app, which reaches 11 million retail customers in Australia.</p>
<p>Little Birdie says this brings its valuation to $130 million AUD (about $100 million USD). Compared to the United States, where Amazon is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/target-breaks-into-the-top-10-list-of-u-s-e-commerce-retailers/">largest e-commerce retailer by far</a>, Australian shoppers <a href="https://ecommerceguide.com/top/top-10-ecommerce-sites-in-australia/">spend more time choosing between several platforms</a>, including large marketplaces like eBay, Gumtree, Amazon, Woolworths and a host of smaller players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Set to launch in mid-June, Little Birdie will aggregate over 70 million products from different online brands and stores, with the goal of being the first place shoppers look when they want to buy something. Users can use Little Birdie to track and compare products, and look for price drops, sales and offers. The SKUs come from a combination of brand partnerships and scraping e-commerce sites, with the majority from retailers’ product feeds.</p>

<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Jon Beros told TechCrunch that “Australia’s e-commerce market is very competitive and quite fragmented with a lot of retailers fighting for market share. The pandemic accelerated online adoption and saw many retailers switch on an online presence, or shift their focus online. With so many players fighting for the attention of shoppers and driving up the cost of acquisition, Little Birdie can genuinely help retailers by providing a new marketing channel that delivers qualified customers leads.”</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank will be able to access Little Birdie’s catalog of shopping content to create targeted offers for customers, including features that link savings goals to specific items through its money management tools. Beros said that Little Birdie will also seek two different types of brand partnerships: “Firstly with retailers who come on board to promote their exclusive offers and products on Little Birdie and secondly with major brands and media companies that look to integrate our shopping content into their apps or websites. These integration partners ultimately deepen the value Little Birdie offers its retail partners by helping to amplify the reach of their offers to a wider audience.”</p>
<p>The company is looking at expansion into Southeast Asia and the United States, but Beros said there is not a firm timeline for its international growth yet, since it depends on the COVID-19 pandemic situation and when borders start to reopen.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Commonwealth Bank group executive Angus Sullivan said, “We believe customers should have access to the world’s best digital experience and our partnership with Little Birdie will give customers access to exclusive industry leading deals via the CommBank app.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/call-analytics-platform-invoca-expands-into-sales-e-commerce-and-customer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding</a> its marketing call analytics platform last year to provide more insights to help those in sales, e-commerce and customer experience, <a href="https://www.invoca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invoca</a> is making its first acquisition to widen the net of companies that it targets. The company has acquired <a href="https://www.dialogtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DialogTech</a>, a startup that builds tools for marketers to analyze inbound phone calls and other contacts, in what TechCrunch understands to be a $100 million deal.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Santa Barbara-based Invoca will be divesting Swydo, a company that Chicago-based DialogTech <a href="https://www.swydo.com/swydo-acquired-dialogtech-strengthen-position-leading-omni-channel-reporting-dashboarding-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired in 2018</a>. Swydo &#8212; originally from The Netherlands &#8212; will remain a partner of Invoca&#8217;s, the company said.</p>
<p>Invoca has up to now focused on larger consumer-facing enterprises &#8212; its customers include the likes of ADT, AutoNation, DISH, TELUS, and The Home Depot &#8212; providing them with an AI-based platform that lets their marketing, sales and other teams analyze calls from consumer customers and provide call tracking, coaching, and other insights in real time and in the form of post-call reports to help those teams do their jobs more easily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gregg Johnson, Invoca&#8217;s CEO and one of growing pool of Salesforce veterans that are reinventing the marketing and sales technology landscape, described DialogTech as &#8220;complementary&#8221; to what Invoca does, but will specifically help Invoca better target mid-market companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The opportunity that both Invoca and DialogTech have identified is that, despite the growth of digital media advertising, social media and other channels for brands to connect to would-be customers, inbound calls remain a very key part of how companies sell goods and services, especially when the sale is of a complex item. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;About 40% to 80% of revenues come through contact centers,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Brands can do all the retargeting they want but the same strategies in digital don&#8217;t work there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those working at the other end of the line, the need for tools to do their jobs better became even more pressing in the last year, a time when customers stayed home and away from physical stores, shifting all of their interactions to virtual and remote channels. Subsequently, they demanded and expected better levels of service there.</span></p>
<p>“This move enables us to be an even better partner to enterprises and agencies looking to optimize their marketing and drive sales,” said DialogTech CEO, Doug Kofoid, in a statement. “Together as Invoca, our combined company will deliver an unrivaled solution for conversation intelligence, with the most innovative technology, expertise, experience, and resources in our industry.”</p>
<p>The combined business will become one of the bigger &#8220;martech&#8221; startups focusing on conversational insights, with 2,000 customers, over 300 employees and on track to make more than $100 million this year in revenue. This is, however, just the tip of the iceberg: the conversational intelligence market was <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/conversational-ai-market-49043506.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to be worth some $4.8 billion in 2020</a> and is expected to balloon to nearly $14 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>Given how many startups we&#8217;ve seen launch in the name of better sales intelligence, it&#8217;s likely that this will not be the last piece of consolidation in the area. Combining to expand the functionality of a platform, or to expand the scale and reach of a business, or simply to bring on interesting tech that is easier to acquire than build from scratch, are three areas that will likely drive more M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Invoca last raised funding in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invoca-raises-56m-to-help-marketers-turn-conversational-insights-into-revenue-300940456.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2019</a>, a $56 million round just ahead of the world shifting into Covid-19 pandemic mode. Johnson confirmed that Invoca &#8212; which has to date raised $116 million from Accel, Upfront Ventures, H.I.G. Growth Partners, Morgan Stanley, Salesforce Ventures and others &#8212; is in a strong enough position as a business not to need to raise more for this acquisition.</p>
<p>However, I suspect that scaling up like this will help it bid for bigger money and a bigger valuation when it does, as will the fact that peers in the market like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gong</a> (which Johnson described as the &#8220;B2B version of Invoca&#8221; to me) have seen their valuations catapult in the last year, spurred by the changes in how customers interact with businesses, and sales and marketing can work to better serve them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From time to time, we see a Chinese app climbing to the top of Google Play and App Store in a host of Western countries. It might be a utility tool like a selfie beautifier or some casual video game, which has universal appeal and require little localization effort. But most of them tend to be a blip on the radar.</p>
<p>The latest Chinese app to top the overseas charts is from TikTok owner ByteDance. Called CapCut, the video editing app allows users to not only add a trove of stickers, filters and effects, it also has a simple-to-use green screen function, a zooming feature that works like a Ken Burns effect, and many more &#8212; which make the app like an accessible Final Cut on the go.</p>
<p>Users won&#8217;t have to worry about paying for music, as CapCut has a library of licensed sound clips that they can use to spice up their content. Over the past year, TikTok has been beefing up its music arsenal through efforts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/tiktok-music/">scouting for musicians</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">signing deals with major labels</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Chinese tech giants are adept at attracting a large user base first by offering their services for free, and then exploring monetization models after users become sticky to the products. CapCut appears to have the same playbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">CapCut&#8217;s Chinese sibling Jianying has already had success among Douyin (TikTok for China) users. Now that pattern is repeating outside China, with TikTok users taking advantage of CapCut to make their videos look sleek and professional with a few taps on their phones. </span></p>
<p>Since May 21, CapCut has been the <a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/all-categories?app_id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&amp;app_name=capcut-video-editor&amp;publisher=bytedance-pte-ltd&amp;start_date=2021-02-24&amp;end_date=2021-05-24&amp;countries=US&amp;chart_type=free&amp;hourly=false&amp;selected_tab=charts&amp;date=2021-05-24&amp;search=">No. 1 free app</a> on the U.S. App Store, according to analytics company SensorTower, and it ranks <a href="https://sensortower.com/android/US/bytedance-pte-ltd/app/capcut-video-editor/com.lemon.lvoverseas/category-rankings?selected_tab=charts&amp;start_date=2021-04-25&amp;end_date=2021-05-24&amp;countries=US&amp;category=all&amp;chart_type=free&amp;device=android&amp;hourly=false&amp;date=2021-05-24">9th on Google Play</a> in the U.S. as of writing. Across the globe, it comes in first among free iOS apps in 33 countries, according to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/1500855883/app-ranking?app_slug=1500855883&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;device=iphone&amp;type=ranks&amp;date=2021-05-22">App Annie</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the app has exceeded 250 million installs globally to date from across the App Store and Google Play, and nearly 9.5 million from U.S. app stores, SensorTower says.</p>
<p>CapCut&#8217;s rise is reminiscent of the Chinese photo editor Meitu. The app was so popular that it became synonymous with a selfie beautifier in China, but it also had a solid base of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/meitu-app-collects-personal-data/">loyal users abroad</a>. The difference is CapCut&#8217;s rise is built on its sibling TikTok&#8217;s global dominance, whereas Meitu&#8217;s early attempt to foster a social network around its photo tool to increase user stickiness never really took off.</p>
<p>CapCut probably won&#8217;t be ByteDance&#8217;s last viral app. TikTok&#8217;s sprawling content empire will spawn more offshoots, whether it&#8217;s a video editor or an e-commerce service for creators to make money and for users to buy the products endorsed by their favorite influencers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment activities in Egypt continue to gain steam, not for startups only but also the funds backing them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, seed accelerator <a href="http://www.flat6labs.com/program/flat6labs-cairo/">Flat6Labs</a> announced the second close of its Egypt fund to support early-stage startups and provide follow-up investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The <a href="https://flat6labs.com/funds/fac/">fund</a> had a target for EGP50 million (~$3.2 million) but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closed at EGP207 million ($13.2 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2011, Flat6Labs is a regional seed accelerator with offices in Egypt and Tunisia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The accelerator launched i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ts Cairo programme </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2017 to invest in more than 100 startups across Egypt over the course of five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups that get into the accelerator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with office space, legal and marketing help, and access to mentorship and networking, among other perks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also receive between EGP500,000 and EGP750,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the close of this round, Flat6Labs has increased the check sizes to EGP1.5 million (~$95,000) and up to EGP3 million (~$191,000) in post-programme follow-on funding for selected startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC), the <a href="https://www.msme.eg/ar/Pages/default.aspx">MSME Development Agency</a>, <a href="https://egyptventures.com/">Egypt Ventures</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eaefund.org/">Egyptian American Enterprise Fund</a> are the anchor investors in Flat6Labs&#8217; seed fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari Ventures, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently closed its $71 million fund, also participated in this second close, and i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t comes as no surprise because the firm, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affiliated with the accelerator, said it would set aside 10% of its fund for Flat6Labs seed-stage companies when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">covered</a> them in April</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Sawari Ventures, our fund strategy has always been to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allocate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a percentage of our fund to the seed stage, which is a completely different proposition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process, culture, and support needed,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wael Amin, managing Partner at Sawari Ventures, said in a statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As investors in Flat6Labs Accelerator Company, we get the opportunity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitably</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Egyptian companies at a very early stage, get early indicators on ecosystem trends, and visibility into the ecosystem.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zeta, a startup that helps banks and fintech firms launch products, is the newest to attain the coveted unicorn status after closing a financing round.</p>
<p>The banking tech firm, co-founded by veteran Indian entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, said on Monday it has raised $250 million in a <s>Series D</s> Series C round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, confirming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/banking-tech-zeta-fundraise-sb/">a TechCrunch report from mid-April</a>. Existing investor Sodexo also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The new round valued the startup, which has offices in Bangalore and Dubai, at $1.45 billion. That’s up from the $300 million valuation that Zeta reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/zeta-300m-sodexo/">in the second half of 2019</a>. (Turakhia said the startup incorrectly called the previous round Series C.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://zeta.tech">Zeta</a> has developed a technology stack that helps it engage with both banks, fintech startups, as well as other online consumer platforms. The thesis is that banks &#8212; largely operating on antiquated technologies &#8212; today don’t have the time and expertise to offer the best experience to hundreds of millions of customers and fintech firms they serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks are still stuck in the &#8217;80s. Many of them still use COBOL programming language. They offer poor user experience,&#8221; said Turakhia in a press briefing Monday, adding that to make up for it, banks end up working with dozens of vendor and technology partners. &#8220;Nobody thought of building the bank stack from the ground up. Until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banks, which have licenses to offer financial services to customers, use Zeta’s cloud-native API and SDKs to launch credit cards, debit cards, loans and offer improved experience to customers, and also work with fintechs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any financial service you can think of, Zeta provides it today,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup today serves 10 banks and 25 fintech firms, and plans to deploy the fresh capital to reach more clients and increase its headcount.</p>

<p>Zeta is SoftBank Vision Fund 2&#8217;s latest investment in India. The Japanese conglomerate, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/"> minted another unicorn in social commerce Meesho</a> last month, is in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">invest up to $500 million in food delivery giant Swiggy</a> and is also <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/tiger-global-in-talks-to-lead-50-75-mn-funding-round-in-whatfix/articleshow/82144685.cms?from=mdr">engaging with SaaS startup WhatFix</a>.</p>
<p>“Banking software is a $300 billion industry globally. Most banks still employ technology which is significantly older than their customers, impacting user experience and engagement,” Munish Varma, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Zeta is the 14th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year as Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, and SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">accelerate their pace of funding in India</a>, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Turakhia, with his brother Divyank, started his first venture in 1998. Along the way, they sold four web companies to Endurance for $160 million. Zeta is the third startup Bhavin has co-founded since then — the other being business messaging platform Flock and Radix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The increasingly digital world represents evolving security, privacy and data protection challenges to banks. The industry needs systems reinvented with security, privacy, scalability and reliability as the core foundations. Zeta&#8217;s Omni Stack answers that need,&#8221; said Ramki Gaddipati, co-founder and chief technology officer of Zeta, in a statement.</p>
