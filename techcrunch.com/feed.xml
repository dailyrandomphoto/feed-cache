										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a Spotify used VC and PE backing to acquire the assets of the music industry so that we must now all rent our music via subscription, rather than own it for life, so a PropTech startup plans to follow a similar strategy for single-family homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.casafari.com/">Casafari</a>, a real estate data platform in Europe based out of Lisbon, Portugal, has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Prudence Holdings in New York. But, crucially, it has also secured a $120 million “mandate&#8221; from Geneva-based private equity investors Stoneweg, among other PE players, in order to buy-to-let residential and commercial real estate. The startup already has operations in Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Other investors include Armilar Venture Partners (the Portuguese VC behind unicorns Outsystems and Feedzai), HJM Holdings, 1Sharpe (founders of Roofstock), and FJ Labs (Fabrice Grinda, founder of OLX Group), as well as existing investor Lakestar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Mila Suharev, Nils Henning, and Mitya Moskalchuk in 2018, Casafari is taking advantage of Europe’s often chaotic real estate data to achieve its goals, due to the lack of a unified Multiple Listings Service (“MLS”).</p>
<p>Casafari plans to aggregate, verify and distribute this data via its platform, hunting down single-family homes as an asset class for institutional investors.</p>
<p>According to Nils Henning, CEO, “CASAFARI has built a unique ecosystem, which connects brokers, developers,  asset managers, and investors and enables sourcing, valuation, underwriting and deal collaboration on single units in all asset classes. We are very excited to represent important institutional clients like Stoneweg and others, in deploying their capital into  fragmented acquisitions at scale, bringing more liquidity to the market and generating more transactions to the broker clients of our platform.”</p>
<p>Private investors are already using the platform. Since launching in 2018, Casafari has been used by Sotheby’s International  Realty, Coldwell Banker, RE/MAX franchises, Savills, Fine &amp; Country, Engel &amp; Voelkers, Keller Williams, and important institutional investors and developers like Stoneweg, Kronos, Vanguard, and Vic Properties.</p>
<p>Mila Suharev, Casafari&#8217;s Co-CEO and CPO said: ”There are currently around 70 billion euros in dry powder in Europe that could be allocated in acquiring residential property in a buy to let strategy, and basically there&#8217;s no offer available. The property will be collected in portfolios, consisting of single units that pension funds, private equity real estate funds, want to build in Europe as they do in the US.”</p>
<p>What Casafari’s is doing is largely following the playbook of what Roofstock in the US did: an online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes. Roofstock has raised  $132.3 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup founder, who hasn’t had much sleep all week, woke up on a recent Sunday to a phone call from his co-founder. A senior engineer was feeling burnt out and was contemplating leaving. For the founder, who had several calls scheduled with many high-profile Silicon Valley investors later in the day, talking this developer out of leaving the job quickly became the top agenda item for the rest of the weekend.</p>
<p>There’s a joke among many startup founders in Bangalore that hiring two to three engineers is currently more time-consuming and cumbersome than securing a fresh round of funding. Heavily-backed startups are paying big premiums to attract and retain talent, making it very challenging for their younger siblings to scale. And relying on recruiters is costly and still takes over a month to close a hire.</p>
<p>A good engineer with two to three years of experience with any recognizable startup expects $70,000 annually as salary, up from about $40,000 a year ago. A puzzled startup founder recently quizzed another peer in the industry how much a good QA engineer costs, and then answered the question himself: about $35,000, up from about $20,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most difficult to poach are those who work at unicorn fintechs CRED and RazorPay, many startup founders said. Engineers from either of the firms expect as much as $150,000 a year, if not more &#8212; often four to five times the amount founders at early stage startups draw themselves.</p>
<p>The intense competition for talent has been prompted by newly turned unicorns increasing the pool on their captables for employee stock options, a concept that was nearly elusive just three years ago. Scores of U.S. and European startups are also aggressively hiring in India as remote working begins to take off.</p>
<p>India has produced a record 16 unicorns this year as Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, and SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">cut large size checks to the nation’s promising startups</a> at a pace never witnessed before in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>Indian startups have raised a record $10.46 billion in the first half of 2021, up from $4 billion during the same period last year, and $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, data insight platform Tracxn told me. (In all of 2020, Indian startups had raised $11.6 billion.)</p>
<p>The average size of a seed round in India was $1.1 million in the first half of 2021, up from $800,000 during the same period last year and $740,000 in 2019, per Tracxn. An average Series A check size this year has been $7.67 million, up from $4.30 million last year, and $5.92 million last year.</p>
<p>Even early-stage startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">at the centre of attraction</a> as virtually everyone is attempting to get in on a deal. Some second-time founders now have the confidence and networking to bypass Sequoia Capital India’s Surge accelerator program and Y Combinator and still gain access to some of the perks they offer.</p>

<p>Some aren’t engaging with funds at all for their seed financing rounds. Scores of startup founders from the past decade have accrued enough capital and reputation to write dozens of checks a year to early promising startups.</p>
<p>The abundance of dry powder in the market and the increased competition from some of the most reputable names in the industry have also changed the power dynamics between founders and investors. It’s becoming common for founders to negotiate from a place of strength to hold on the rights and preferential treatments from investors.</p>
<p>On a call recently, two founders discussed what many would consider a first-world dilemma: Dozens of investors had agreed to invest in them, but they no longer had so much stake to offer. So they strategize what stake to give whom and how to politely get others to reduce the size of their committed check size.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But some investors are worried that the music may stop soon.</p>
<p>Investors at several high-profile firms told me that many startups are taking checks from Tiger Global / Falcon / SoftBank too early in their journeys.</p>
<p>They argue that many of these young startups have raised funds at such a high valuation that if they are not able to hit the metrics they have told their existing lead investors, very few in the industry would be in a position to engage with them at a later stage.</p>
<p>“And even the likes of Tiger will not back you then,” one investor said, pointing to examples such as Bangalore-based Upstox, which raised from Tiger Global in the past, but later Tiger<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/"> invested in its chief rival Groww</a>. “Tiger is backing the race, not the horse,” another investor said.</p>
<p>A down cycle is a scenario many investors are preparing for. But it appears the music, so to speak, has only gotten louder in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based edtech <strong>Brightchamps</strong> is in advanced stages of talks to raise at over $500 million valuation, while <strong>Ola Electric</strong> has held talks to raise at over $3 billion valuation, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Fidelity and Goldman Sachs have held talks to invest in a pre-IPO round of <strong>Paytm</strong>, one person said.</p>
<p><strong>ShareChat</strong> is about to raise $150 million to $200 million from Temasek and others at a pre-money valuation of $2.8 billion. Prosus Ventures is in advanced stages of talks to lead an investment round in <strong>Upstox</strong>.</p>
<p>Sequoia is in talks to invest in <strong>Gitcoin</strong> and back <strong>Dive</strong> again, while <strong>Infra.Market</strong>, which was valued at $200 million in December last year and $1 billion earlier this year, is in talks to raise at over $2 billion valuation. Many other startups that turned unicorns this year are also in the market to finalize new rounds. <strong>BharatPe</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, and <strong>Yap</strong> are in advanced stages of talks to finalize new rounds, TechCrunch has reported in recent weeks.</p>
<p>There are at least seven more $50 million+ rounds, and more than a dozen $20 million+ rounds that are expected to close within weeks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Bangalore, there’s another sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Several founders in India are starting crypto startups for customers across the world, but high-profile investors in India have largely stayed away from this category, in part, because of India&#8217;s confusing stand about virtual currencies. Their absence has resulted in many of these startups secure funds from international funds and angels.</p>
<p>But this may change soon. Several venture funds including Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed, Accel, WEH, and Kalaari are currently building their thesis for investments in crypto startups, people familiar with the matter told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/">Renegade Partners</a> &#8212; a Bay Area-based venture firm cofounded by veteran VCs Renata Quintini and Roseanne Wincek &#8212; is taking the wraps off a $100 million debut venture fund that&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalists-renata-quintini-roseanne-wincek-to-raise-300-million-for-debut-fund-11568145232">capturing the imagination</a> of the business press since almost its conception in late 2019.</p>
<p>The effort is interesting for a number of reasons, not least because of the backgrounds of both Quintini and Wincek, both of whom left powerhouse venture firms to join forces. Quintini, a trained attorney, was an investment manager with Stanford University&#8217;s endowment before being recruited into Felicis Ventures, after which she was poached by Lux Capital. Across those firms, she worked closely with a number of high-flying startups, including the autonomous driving company  Cruise, the satellite startup Planet, and the clothing company Bonobos.</p>
<p>Wincek was meanwhile once set on nabbing a PhD at UC Berkeley, instead leaving the school with a master&#8217;s degree in biophysics to head to Stanford for her MBA. From there, it was on to Canaan as a principal, and from there, she headed to IVP, where she rose through the senior ranks to partner, investing across enterprise and consumer companies that include Glossier, Compass, MasterClass, and TransferWise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not a new trend, successful VCs who happen to be women leaving established firms to create their own outfits. Think Mary Meeker of Bond, Dayna Grayson of Construct Capital, and Beth Seidenberg of Westlake Village BioPartners, just to name a few. But unlike some of its predecessors, Renegade isn&#8217;t limiting itself to playing a certain role in the venture universe. It isn&#8217;t bound to any sector. It isn&#8217;t marketing itself as an early-stage venture firm. What it is looking for is a fairly specific mix of traction, team, and market &#8212; a combination that it is finding in companies that are anywhere from their Series A to Series C stage.</p>
<p>An in-house <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/ismael-hishon-rezaizadeh">head data scientist</a> from the insurance giant John Hancock is helping home in on companies in Renegade&#8217;s sweet spot, say the cofounders.. So is a chief people officer with a <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/susan-alban">powerful resume</a> of her own (Uber, Zoom, Milo); principal Chloe Breider, a former IVP investor who worked closely with Wincek; and, as Renegade&#8217;s &#8220;decision scientist,&#8221; the former professional poker player and best-selling author Annie Duke.</p>
<p>We talked with Quintini and Wincek earlier today to learn more about what they have assembled &#8212; and how Renegade makes its mark in an industry that has never been more competitive. Excerpts from that chat, below, have been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: People would probably shiv someone to get a job at either firm where you worked. What drove you to leave, and who reached out to whom when it came time to partner?</strong></p>
<p>RW: We first met when I was a Canaan and Renata was at Felicis, and back then, there weren&#8217;t many women in venture, so [women VCs were like] &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a new one, &#8216;Come meet everybody.'&#8221; Over the years, we looked at a lot of stuff together, and especially after I moved to IVP,  I was always bugging Renata about what was in her portfolio.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we were at one of those big, boozy dinners, with a bunch of people of our age at a bunch of firms. We were all having the conversation like, &#8216;Oh, if I had my own firm, I would do this, and I would do that,&#8217; and Renata and I were finishing each other&#8217;s sentences. And I remember going up to her and saying, &#8220;We should have this conversation for real but maybe with less wine.&#8221; And that was Memorial Day of 2019.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Institutional investors sometimes worry about how well an emerging manager team will get along when they&#8217;re coming from different places. How did you address this?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: We were good friends, I thought Roseanne was a phenomenal investor, but frankly, we didn&#8217;t know if we would be good cofounders and that&#8217;s the biggest risk, right? We did ask: how do we de-risk this? And we actually hired a coach for what we jokingly refer to as marriage counseling. But we did a lot of work around how we handle stress and what success looks like and what our values are. We also spent a <em>lot</em> of time in hotel rooms, and I can tell you that Roseanne is more of a morning person than I am.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were raising this in the middle of the pandemic. How did that impact fundraising?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: We had our first close on Friday, March 13, the weekend before COVID [started shutting everything down]. The Grand Princess Cruise was <a href="https://abc7news.com/grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-san-francisco-bay-port-of-oakland/10362884/">coming into the Bay</a>, and we&#8217;re on the phone with the LPs, and we didn&#8217;t know if people were to going to come through. I think if we didn&#8217;t have our track records to draw from, [the fund] wouldn&#8217;t have happened. We were very lucky that we were backed by institutional LPs &#8212; an Ivy League school, endowments, foundations, family offices. But we did not factor in COVID.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I see language about the &#8220;supercritical stage&#8221; on Renegade&#8217;s site. What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>RW: That phrase is purposely vague, because we don&#8217;t think the stage definitions mean that much anymore. I started my career as a chemist way back when, and supercritical fluid is the state of matter that is neither liquid nor gas but both at the same time, and we feel like companies can be the same. There&#8217;s a product to market, there is some data, there&#8217;s early customer love and generally a sizable team, but they&#8217;re not the big growth companies yet, right? They&#8217;re not ready to raise a big growth round and pour fuel on the fire, and that&#8217;s how we think about [our ideal targets].</p>
<p>Our sweet spot is [a startup with] early revenue &#8212; from a quarter million dollars a year up to a million dollars a month &#8212; [that have] from 20 to 100 employees [and which are] raising rounds that are between $10 million and $50 million. Our first deal was actually a Series C deal, but we have Series A and Series B companies in the portfolio, too, that all sit in that sandbox.</p>
<p>RQ: There&#8217;s so much capital today that capital is cheap. But execution is expensive, so our focus is on preparing startups to execute as big, giant companies. It&#8217;s: How do I think about the organization as it scales? How do I think about the exact team that I need? How do I think about my option pool? About my founder role design? How do you manage your capital and leverage your board? Things are working so well for some founders that the wheels are falling off the bus; meanwhile, many are thinking about these same questions [that they never had time to sort out].</p>
<p><strong>TC: If you aren&#8217;t sector or stage focused, how do you whittle down what you&#8217;re looking to fund?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: One good thing about [the types of startups we&#8217;re backing] is that they were funded by somebody else before, so it&#8217;s a known universe, if you&#8217;re thinking about it from a data science perspective.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it&#8217;s applying the heuristics that Roseanne, myself, Chloe, Susan [Alban, Renage&#8217;s chief people officer], have had from a decade plus of investing and working at outlier companies. It&#8217;s not just a number. It&#8217;s the quality of revenue. It&#8217;s a combination of other breadcrumbs that the companies put out there in terms of who have they hired and what are customers thinking of their product, and is this company building a system of record, and what is the velocity of adoption. Technology alone can&#8217;t do [the work].</p>
<p><strong>TC: There&#8217;s so much money sloshing around right now. In terms of the advice you&#8217;re giving your portfolio companies, what do you tell them about how to react when someone knocks on the door and offers more funding right after they&#8217;ve closed a round?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: There are so many dimensions here.  First, you should look at it from your company&#8217;s needs. You got to deploy this capital, and you got to provide a return on this capital, and nothing is free, so the more money you raise, the higher the valuation you receive, it catches up to you in the next round because you got to clear that watermark.</p>
<p>[We also tell them to ask themselves] do you have investments to make? Do you have team to hire? Some founders we&#8217;ve talked with have said, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to raise any more because I cannot go faster or deploy more than my model is already supporting.  I&#8217;m actually going to execute more and then take more [capital] down the road when I&#8217;m going to get more credit for the stuff that I built, and the ROI is going to be better.&#8217;</p>
<p>The other piece, too, is when you&#8217;re in a very competitive environment, you have to look at what&#8217;s happening around you. Sometimes if your competitors are raising and pushing the market forward, it may be a reason to think [about raising more than you&#8217;d planned] because maybe they can out-hire you or they can outspend you in certain areas and can generate more traction. So you can&#8217;t look at things in absolute terms. At the same time, there is no free money and a lot of founders unwittingly create more problems for themselves [by not thinking through what that next check means].</p>
<p><strong>TC: People see a women-led venture team and wonder how focused you will be on women-led startups.</strong></p>
<p>RQ: I think we&#8217;re great investors who happen to be female. Our primary focus is on diversity of experience and thoughts. Gender is  just one of the lenses, and diversity is one of the core values of organization because we believe that provides better returns.</p>
<p>RW: One thing that&#8217;s been really fun and validating and inspiring about all this is the people who do come out of the woodwork who are so excited [about Renegade], because representation matters. At the end of the day, this is how this changes. We chip away at this and soon, you won&#8217;t ask this question anymore because it won&#8217;t be topical. That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you feel that the diversity matters for LPs? Do you think that diversity is going to be codified in the way that LPs are looking at investing in funds?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: Some lead with it. Others say, &#8216;Let me look at past returns. They look at lagging indicators.&#8217; Today, founders are picking investors who reflect their values, who they&#8217;re proud to be associated with &#8212; people who have their same energy people and will go to bat for them and with them. These are the returns of the future, regardless of whatever Cambridge tells you today about investments that were made in the past. Leading LPs know this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce in Europe is expected to grow 30% this year to <a href="https://internetretailing.net/rxgeu/rxgeu/european-ecommerce-revenues-jump-30-to-us465bn-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$465 billion</a>, and that&#8217;s giving rise to a new ecosystem of services built to cater to e-commerce merchants. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.juni.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juni</a>, a neobank that is built specifically for companies selling online, has closed a Series A of $21.5 million, only 12 weeks after officially opening for business.</p>
<p>The Series A is being co-led by partners from D<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ST Global and Felix Capital with previous backer Cherry Ventures and other early investors also participating. Gothenburg, Sweden-based Juni had previously raised a seed round fo €2 million ($2.4 million) back in November when it was still only in waiting-list mode.</span></p>
<p>Part of the reason that the latest funding has materialized so quickly is because Juni has had very strong take-up its three short months of life: Samir El-Sabini, Juni&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that startup has signed up 300 businesses from a waitlist of 3,000, representing customer growth of around 500% month-on-month. Customers, he said, were primarily those selling their own inventory; dropshippers selling on behalf of retailers; and performance marketers who have moved into selling goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other reason is that Juni is doing so well on both the investor and customer fronts is because of what it has identified and understood, and is building to fix.</p>
<p>El-Sabini and his two co-founders Anders Oresdal (CTO) and Jonathan Sanders (COO) all come from a background of working in e-commerce and fintech (in fact, one previously was at expenses startup Pleo, which this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a major round of funding</a>; and two others worked at another expense management startup) and so they know all too well the shortcomings of a lot of banking services when it comes to serving businesses carry out their business online.</p>
<p>As El-Sabini described it, while traditional banks have long courted SMBs as customers, they have never truly understood the dynamics, challenges and particularities of running an e-commerce business, and that has made them less responsive to the financial profiles and needs of these companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is that we provide insights and knowledge of the e-commerce industry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we can have a low risk profile because we understand all the cost centers. We understand what Taboola is, we know Shopify.&#8221; El-Sabini noted that typically e-commerce companies have money spread out across different services such as ad networks, payment gateways and their banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we give them a unified view of all those dashboards. Then we derive insights based on all that activity to give you &#8216;the right number&#8217;,&#8221; by which he means a real idea of what the company&#8217;s cashflow, incomings and outgoings are across all of these services so that you know how much you have to invest or use in other areas, and specifically on advertising to bring in more customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about return on ad spend and liquidity,&#8221; said El-Sabini.</p>
<p>Cashflow comes into play also with the payment cards that Juni provides as part of its service, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need a card with high spending limits,&#8221; primarily to account for how you spend money over the month and then pay it back in in a delayed way (due to the time taken for revenues to clear payment gateways, etc). Without the high limits, your card might get rejected when you use it to pay for marketing and ad campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ad campaigns will not do well if you get a card decline,&#8221; he said, since Google and others typically demote you in its algorithms when that happens. &#8220;My previous company used to switch cards every quarter because we had so many declines.&#8221; That, of course, is a pain to sort out and definitely not what you want to be spending your time doing if you&#8217;re trying to grow your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>And, when there is a problem, El-Sabini notes that its customer service people speak the same language as the customers, so will be able to address and cope with their issues better.</p>
<p>To sum up all of the above, Juni simply built the kind of bank that the founders wished they had at their previous companies, and that has resonated with others, resulting in what El-Sabini called &#8220;tremendous, fund and hopeful growth.&#8221; Case in point: the press release I was sent for the story last week noted that Juni had 250 customers across Europe, but by the time we talked the number had grown to over 300.</p>
<p>There is something else interesting about what Juni is doing, which points to a bigger trend in fintech that is probably worth watching, too.</p>
<p>Neobanks have made significant inroads into the world of finance, providing consumers with a better and more modern user experience, more personalization and often better rates than their larger, incumbent counterparts, and we have seen some major developments on that front: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge valuations</a>,<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19756/why-neobanks-have-refocused-from-skyrocketing-growth-to-reaching-profitability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> big customer growth</a>, and now, slowly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chime-ipo-exclusive-idUSKBN2B82TG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first </a>of them<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-is-going-public-and-were-very-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> going public</a>.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing a very strong second wave of neobanks emerging, which are less widely targeted and aiming at more specific, vertical opportunities. These could be something like targeting the <a href="https://www.oxbury.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agricultural community</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelancers</a>, or SMBs, or specifically companies working in e-commerce as Juni has.</p>
<p>On that note, there really are a lot of fintech startups targeting smaller businesses with banking services now. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/small-business-challenger-bank-finom-raises-another-12-million-to-expand-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/wise-locks-down-5-7-million-to-scale-its-challenger-bank-designed-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo</a>, and many others. There is even some competition specifically within e-commerce neobanks, with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/greeces-viva-wallet-raises-80m-for-its-neo-bank-targeting-small-business-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.incard.co/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incard</a> (which appears yet to launch), <a href="https://yanbank.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yan</a>, and likely more also attempting to cater to the same people that Juni is.</p>
<p>For now it is standing out partly because of how quickly it&#8217;s getting adopted, and how they have set out to own this space. That will see Juni also moving into a wider range of products to fill out more of the needs of running an e-commerce business, be it more kinds of credit products to keep cash flowing, one reason why storied investors like DST are interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just three months, Juni has already proven that it has the potential to become the next big technology solution for merchants worldwide. The product resonates strongly with their customers by solving a clear pain point and putting time back in the hands of digital entrepreneurs,&#8221; said Joseph Pizzolato and Susan Lin, investors at Felix Capital, in a joint statement. “As investors, we look for signs of ‘customer love’ and ‘digital queues’ in all our investments, and a waitlist of over 3,000 SMEs for Juni’s product is as good as we’ve seen! We immediately connected with the team and we firmly believe in their vision. Their attention to detail and understanding of their customer’s needs puts them in an ideal position to win this market.”</p>
<p>“Samir, Anders, Jonathan, and the team continue to amaze us,&#8221; added Sophia Bendz, a partner at Cherry Ventures. &#8220;Since Juni’s beta launch, they’ve experienced an extremely impressive month-on-month transaction volume in such a short period. They have also built a world class team across compliance, finance, tech, and marketing functions as well as fostered a deep commitment to building community and trustworthiness. They are well on their way to becoming the go-to financial companion for e-commerce entrepreneurs globally. This is only the beginning and we couldn’t be more excited to continue to back this team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The numbers don&#8217;t lie.</p>
<p>According to DocSend, the average pitch deck is reviewed for just three minutes. And if you think a senior VC is studying the presentation your team crafted for months as if it were a Fabergé egg — well, you might be disappointed.</p>
<p>Even if you are lucky enough to land a meeting, it&#8217;s more likely that a junior person went through your pitch and ran it up the chain.</p>
<p>“The biggest lie in venture capital is: ‘Yes, I read through your deck,’” says Evan Fisher, founder of Unicorn Capital and Minimal Capital.</p>
<p>“Because those words are immediately followed by, ‘ … but why don’t you run us through it from the beginning?’”</p>

<hr />
<p>According to Fisher, the <em>pro forma</em> pitch deck is a thing of the past. Instead, the founders he&#8217;s worked with who made video pitches netted two to five times as many investor meetings as people who sent traditional pitch decks.</p>
<p>They also received up to five times more in terms of investor commitments from the first 20 meetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the only benefit was that other investment committee members heard the story direct from the founder, that alone would make your video pitch worth it,&#8221; says Fisher.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">an exclusive interview</a> with Hardware Editor Brian Heater, Nothing Founder Carl Pei discussed the product and design principles underpinning Ear (1), a set of US$99/€99/£99 wireless earbuds that will hit the market later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re starting with smart devices,&#8221; said Pei. &#8220;Ear (1) is our is our first device. I think it has good potential to gain some traction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Apple&#8217;s market share and the number of players already competing in the space, &#8220;we’ve just focused on being ourselves,&#8221; said Nothing&#8217;s founder, who also shared initial marketing plans and discussed the inherent tensions involved with manufacturing consumer hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is a trade-off. Like if you pursue this design, that has a ton of implications. Battery life has ton of implications on size and on cost. The materials you use have implications on cost. Everything has an implication on timeline. It’s like 4D chess in terms of trade-offs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last week, just days after its U.S. IPO, cybersecurity regulators in China banned ride-hailing company Didi from onboarding new members.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, authorities called for Didi to be removed from several app stores due to &#8220;serious violations of laws and regulations in collecting and using personal information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move suggests that China&#8217;s government &#8220;is willing to sacrifice business results for control,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm in this morning&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;For China-based companies hoping to list in the United States, the market likely just got much, much colder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jasper Kuria, the managing partner of CRO consultancy The Conversion Wizards, walks through an A/B test showing how research-driven CRO (conversion rate optimization) techniques led to a 79% increase in conversion rates for China Expat Health, a lead-generation company.</p>
<p>“Using research-based CRO principles to optimize a landing page for PPC (pay per click) traffic produced a 79% conversion lift, dramatically reducing the cost per lead for the company,” Kuria writes.</p>
<p>“They could then afford to bid more per click, which increased their overall monthly leads. CRO can have this kind of transformative effect on your business.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 6, 2021. We’re back after a holiday here in the United States. Not that that stopped global technology news, mind, so there’s a lot to get into. Before we do, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/announcing-the-startups-pitching-at-tc-early-stage/">one more reminder about TechCrunch Early Stage later this week</a> &#8212; your humble servant is running a session with venture capitalist Sarah Kunst about fundraising. It’s going to rock. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Today’s Top 3 are all about conflict. Between tech companies, between tech companies and governments, and between tech companies and their shareholders. Enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/"><strong>Governments versus tech:</strong></a> The scrap between China’s government and Chinese ride-hailing company Didi escalated over the break, from the company having to stop accepting new users to losing its spot in app stores. The company’s stock is down sharply today. Our read? China’s government crackdown on tech is not over, and Chinese companies going public in America just hit a pace better described as <em>glacial</em>. Related: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/">Twitter versus India is still rolling along</a>, and it’s not going well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">A cloudy mess:</a></strong> Remember that huge deal to award a cloud contract from the U.S. military to one major tech company? Microsoft won; Amazon pitched a fit. And now neither company will get the $10 billion deal. Womp.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">Box versus investors:</a></strong> Rounding out our conflict coverage, the latest from Box. Former cloud storage darling and present-day public enterprise productivity shop Box is locked in a lengthy argument with activist investor Starboard. Today, Box went the corporate equivalent of supernova by releasing a TikTok video of its communications with the investing group, essentially calling them out for hypocrisy. Not that that charge means much to amoral capital pools searching for above-market returns, but, hey, it made for some good headlines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Today’s startup news includes a number of funding rounds, a neat new venture capital fund and some SPAC news from <em>space</em> (and Earth):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/meet-super-mx-the-mexico-city-based-insurtech-that-raised-7-2m-from-vcs-and-unicorn-ceos/">Super.mx raises $7.2 million:</a> </strong>The Mexico City-based insurtech startup has put together a Series A for its “managing general agent” approach to offering coverage. The startup claims to be able to “handle the entire user experience just like a direct-to-consumer carrier, but with the breadth of product choice offered by an aggregator.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/single-earth-to-link-carbon-credits-to-crypto-token-market-raises-7-9m-from-eqt-ventures/"><strong>Single.Earth raises $7.9M for crypto-carbon tokens:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s an idea that I don’t fully understand: linking carbon credits to tokens that represent the real world. That’s the gist of Single.Earth, which wants to shake up how companies compensate for their carbon footprint. It uses MERIT tokens, and, <a href="https://www.single.earth/">per its website</a>, is creating a “digital twin” of the natural world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/wagmo-raises-12-5-million-to-offer-pet-insurance-and-a-lot-more/"><strong>Wagmo raises $12.5M for better pet insurance:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Insurtech is a hot market because insurance is a huge market. So large that even its subdivisions are attracting startup competition. Wagmo &#8212; not Waymo, mind &#8212; wants to bring more pet services into its product to cover your pet more holistically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, a new fund:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/ifly-vc-second-fund/">iFly.vc raises second fund worth $46M:</a> </strong>I don’t bring you many new venture capital fundraises because they seem a bit meta for our startup focus, but here’s one regardless. Why include it? The venture capital group &#8212; which has a neat history, as the post details &#8212; relocated from San Francisco to Austin during the pandemic. That’s notable.</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the SPAC beat:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/"><strong>Space SPAC:</strong></a> Sattelogic is going public via a SPAC. Its deck is light on past results and heavy on future incomes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/"><strong>Earth SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Nextdoor is going public via a SPAC. Its deck is far more rooted in terrestrial things, like trailing revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/">TechCrunch covered upcoming headphones from Nothing</a>, a hardware upstart that we don’t know much about. But it thinks its $99 headphone offering can compete with Apple’s AirPods Pro line. Which cost 2.5x as much. If a startup can manage that, we’ll be super impressed. And Nothing will be worth several somethings.</p>
<h2>Nothing founder Carl Pei on Ear (1) and building a hardware startup from scratch</h2>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch Hardware Editor Brian Heater, Nothing Founder Carl Pei discussed the product and design principles underpinning Ear (1), a set of US$99/€99/£99 wireless earbuds that will hit the market later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re starting with smart devices,&#8221; said Pei. &#8220;Ear (1) is our first device. I think it has good potential to gain some traction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Apple&#8217;s market share and the number of players already competing in the space, &#8220;we’ve just focused on being ourselves,&#8221; said Nothing&#8217;s founder, who also shared initial marketing plans and discussed the inherent tensions involved with manufacturing consumer hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is a trade-off. Like if you pursue this design, that has a ton of implications. Battery life has ton of implications on size and on cost. The materials you use have implications on cost. Everything has an implication on timeline. It’s like 4D chess in terms of trade-offs.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We got through most of the Big Tech news in our Top Three today, but there’s still a bit more for your enjoyment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-shares-its-ideas-around-new-privacy-features-including-a-way-to-hide-your-account-from-searches/"><strong>Twitter shares its ideas around new privacy features, including a way to hide your account from searches:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This matters because it underscores how Twitter’s product team has somehow found top gear and left the engine in it; the company seems to have discussed and released more stuff in the last few quarters than in the last few years. We’re here for it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/verizon-thor/"><strong>Verizon demos THOR, its new vehicle for frontline rapid humanitarian response:</strong></a><strong> </strong>What’s big, red and intimidating? No, it’s not Verizon’s debt load, it’s THOR (for Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response), a huge truck-thing that Verizon is tinkering with that could bring connectivity to disaster zones. Frankly, cool. Not that I am forgiving Verizon for all the rest, but at least it can demo up a neat monster truck.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, that was fast. Just days after a Twitter clone from former Trump spokesperson Jason Miller launched, the new social network is already beset by problems.</p>
<p>For one, hackers quickly leveraged Gettr&#8217;s API to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv44m/hackers-scrape-90000-gettr-user-emails-surprising-no-one">scrape the email addresses</a> of more than 85,000 of its users. Usernames, names and birthdays were also part of the scraped data set, which was surfaced by Alon Gal, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;When threat actors are able to extract sensitive information due to neglectful API implementations, the consequence is equivalent to a data breach and should be handled accordingly by the firm [and] examined by regulators,&#8221; Gal told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, TechCrunch&#8217;s own Zack Whittaker <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1410669640188055566">predicted</a> that Gettr would soon see its data scraped through its API.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Threat actors were able to take advantage of bad API implemented on Trump&#39;s recent social media platform, Gettr (<a href="https://twitter.com/GettrOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GettrOfficial</a>).</p>
<p>This allowed them to extract usernames, names, bios, bdays, but most importantly, the emails which were supposed to be private, of over 85,000 users. <a href="https://t.co/NsKyz9zHmQ">pic.twitter.com/NsKyz9zHmQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) <a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1412299945772785664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The scraped data is just one of Gettr&#8217;s headaches. The app actually went live in the App Store and Google Play last month but left beta on July 4 following a<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606"> launch post in Politico</a>. While the app is meant to appeal to the famously anti-China Trump sphere, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpworld-app-is-bankrolled-by-fugitive-chinese-billionaire?ref=home">Gettr apparently received early funding</a> from Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, an ally of former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that Guo is at the center of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/17/guo-wengui-disinformation-steve-bannon/">massive online disinformation network</a> that spreads anti-vaccine claims and QAnon conspiracies.</p>
<p>On July 2, the app&#8217;s team apologized for signup delays citing a spike in downloads, but a bit of launch downtime is probably the least of its problems. Over the weekend, a number of official Gettr accounts, including Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Steve Bannon and Miller&#8217;s own, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gettr-trump-allies-get-accounts-hacked-july-4-launch-day-2021-7">were compromised</a>, raising more questions about the app&#8217;s shoddy security practices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jason Miller&#39;s new right-wing social media site &quot;Gettr&quot; was hacked this morning. <a href="https://t.co/cncddw9RZ9">pic.twitter.com/cncddw9RZ9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1411697118079860741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>That incident aside, fake accounts overwhelm any attempt to find verified users on Gettr. That goes for the app&#8217;s own recommendations too: a fake brand account for Steam was among the app&#8217;s own recommendations during TechCrunch&#8217;s testing.</p>
<p>Another red flag: The app&#8217;s design is conspicuously identical to Twitter and appears to have used the company&#8217;s API to copy some users&#8217; follower counts and profiles. Gettr encourages new users to use their Twitter handle in the sign up process, saying that it will allow tweets to be copied over in some cases (we signed up, but this didn&#8217;t work for us). TechCrunch reached out to Twitter about Gettr&#8217;s striking similarities and the use of its API but the company declined to comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trumps Gettr website didn&#39;t just copy old Twitter posts it hotlinks to Twitter images! <a href="https://t.co/848G6zTXuS">pic.twitter.com/848G6zTXuS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; zedster (@z3dster) <a href="https://twitter.com/z3dster/status/1410654138921279499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>On mobile, Gettr is basically an exact clone of Twitter — albeit one that&#8217;s very rough around the edges. Some of Gettr&#8217;s copy is stilted and strange, including the boast that it&#8217;s a &#8220;non-bias&#8221; social network that &#8220;tried the best to provide best software quality to the users, allow anyone to express their opinion freely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is positioning itself as an alternative for anyone who believes that mainstream social networks are hostile to far right ideas. Gettr&#8217;s website beckons new users with familiar Trumpian messaging: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be Cancelled. Flex Your 1st Amendment. Celebrate Freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hydroxycholoroquine works!&#8221; Miller shared (Gettr&#8217;d?) over the weekend, quoting the former president. &#8220;And nobody is going to take down this post or suspend this account! #GETTR.&#8221; So far on Gettr, content moderation is either lax or nonexistent. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/parler-crawls-back-online-empty-and-with-a-tea-party-ceo/">as we&#8217;ve seen with Parler</a> and other havens for sometimes violent conspiracies, that approach can only last so long.</p>
<p>In spite of being widely associated with Trump through Miller and former Trump campaign staffer Tim Murtaugh, the former president doesn&#8217;t yet have a presence on the app. Some figures from Trump&#8217;s orbit have established profiles on Gettr, including Steve Bannon (84.7K followers) and Mike Pompeo (1.3M followers), but a search for Trump only brings up unofficial accounts. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/former-trump-aide-starts-social-media-platform-without-old-boss?sref=ExbtjcSG">reported</a> that Trump has no plans to join the app. (Given Gettr&#8217;s <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-smut-is-flooding-trump-s-new-social-network-1847226591">preponderance of Sonic the Hedgehog porn</a>, we can&#8217;t exactly blame him.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say whether the app&#8217;s technical issues or Trump&#8217;s absence will dampen interest in Gettr. According to estimates from<a href="https://sensortower.com/"> Sensor Tower</a>, Gettr has racked up roughly 1.3 million installs globally since June, with Brazil trailing the U.S. as the app&#8217;s second-biggest market.</p>
<p>The online pro-Trump ecosystem remains scattered in mid-2021. With Trump banned and the roiling conspiracy network around QAnon no longer welcome on Facebook and Twitter, Gettr positioned itself as a refuge for mainstream social media&#8217;s many outcasts. But given Gettr&#8217;s mounting early woes, the sketchy Twitter clone&#8217;s moment in the sun might already be coming to an end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While SaaS has become the default way to deliver software in 2021, it still takes a keen eye to find the companies that will grow into successful businesses, maybe even more so with so much competition. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re bringing together three investors to discuss what they look for when they invest in SaaS startups.</p>
<p>For starters, we&#8217;ll have <a href="https://greylock.com/team/sarah-guo/">Sarah Guo</a>, who has been a partner at Greylock since 2013 where she concentrates on AI, cybersecurity, infrastructure and the future of work &#8212; all in a SaaS context of course. Among her investments are Obsidian, Clubhouse and Awake. Her exits include Demisto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-demisto-for-560m/">which Palo Alto acquired for $560 million</a> in 2019 and Skyhigh Networks, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/mcafee-skyhigh-networks/">McAfee bought for $400 million</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Greylock, she worked for Goldman Sachs investing in growth-stage companies and advising SaaS companies like Dropbox and Workday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next we&#8217;ll have <a href="https://upfront.com/people/kobie-fuller">Kobie Fuller</a>, a partner at Upfront Ventures, who looks at SaaS as well as AR and VR. Fuller has been at Upfront since 2016 when he joined after a three-year stint at Accel. He oversaw a pair of billion dollar exits while at Accel including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">ExactTarget to Salesforce</a> for $2.5 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebooks-acquisition-of-oculus-closes-now-official/">Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion</a>. Upfront investments include Bevy, community building software, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/">recently got a $40 million investment</a> with 20% of that coming from 25 Black investors.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll have <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/team/investors/casey-aylward/">Casey Aylward</a>, a principal at Costanoa Ventures where she concentrates on early-stage enterprise startups. Among her investments have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/aserto-announces-5-1m-seed-to-build-authorization-as-a-service/">Aserto</a>, Bigeye and Cyral. She tends to concentrate on developer tools. &#8220;My entire career so far has been focused on developers: whether it was building tools for developers, building software myself or now investing in enabling technologies for the next generation of technical users,&#8221; she wrote on her bio page.</p>
<p>This prestigious group will share their thoughts at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=vcpanel&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=vcpanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>, a one-day virtual event that will examine the state of SaaS to help startup founders, developers and investors understand the state of play and what’s next.

					<description><![CDATA[How do you stay ahead of your competition when you know it's only a matter of time before they copy your best features? The solution is messaging, says conversion optimization expert Peep Laja.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a unique product used to give you at least a few months of lead time over other players, but that advantage seems to matter less and less — just think of how Twitter Spaces managed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">land on Android ahead of Clubhouse.</a></p>
<p>In this context, how do you stay ahead of your competition when you know it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they copy your best features?</p>
<p>The solution is messaging, says conversion optimization expert <a href="https://peeplaja.com/">Peep Laja</a>. Unlike features that can be copied and commoditized, a strategic narrative can be a long-term advantage. In the interview below, he explains why and how startups should work on this from their very early days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>(TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"> this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.)</em></p>
<p>Laja is the founder of several marketing and optimization businesses: <a href="https://cxl.com/">CXL</a>,<a href="https://speero.com/"> Speero</a> and<a href="https://wynter.com"> Wynter</a>. In a recent<a href="https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1374819822979194886 "> Twitter thread</a>, he highlighted common stories and narratives that startups can use, such as &#8220;challenging the way things have always been done&#8221; or &#8220;irreverence,&#8221; and came up with examples of companies that employ these tactics. We asked him to expand on some of his thoughts and recommendations for startup founders.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Your site&#8217;s tagline tells startups that &#8220;product-based differentiation is going away&#8221; and that they should &#8220;win on messaging.&#8221; Can you explain the rationale behind this?</strong></p>
<p>David Cancel, the CEO of Drift, said that famously in 2017.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, any startup is competing on innovation or messaging, and, ideally, on both. Usually, you want to start with innovation &#8212; do something new or something better. However, competing on features is a transient advantage. Doing what no one else is doing won&#8217;t last: Sooner or later, you&#8217;ll get copied by big players or other startups, so innovation is not enough. Features are a transient advantage that lasts maybe two years, but rarely more. Meanwhile, having the right narrative and messaging can give you a long-lasting advantage.</p>
<p>Startups competing on story have a big advantage if they are bold because big companies optimize for being safe, and that often means being very boring, but nobody will call them out for it. In contrast, startups can be brave and polarizing on purpose.</p>
<p>Ideally, you start with innovation, and at the same time start building your brand as well. Once the competition achieves feature parity, you make people choose you because of the brand. It’s hard to be sustainably objectively better than others, but you definitely cannot be objectively worse.</p>
<p><strong>You help startups do research to find and validate their strategic narrative. Can you explain this concept?</strong></p>
<p>As startups get bigger, they realize that they need to communicate less on features and more on story. Their narrative needs to be connected to a bigger concept and be a strategic narrative. &#8220;The world used to be like this, but it changed, and our startup will help you in this new context.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fictional example would be selling a course of AI for marketers; ideally, instead of talking about AI, you&#8217;d lead with a story, explaining that AI and machine learning are an unstoppable thing that is going to change everything. The future is already here, but not evenly distributed yet. There is no stopping this train. You can get on it, or get left behind. Companies that adopt AI will overtake others, and marketers need to learn AI to adapt. This would make the product way more attractive … than selling it through features: “AI for marketers course. Seven hours of video. Top lecturers.”</p>
<p>This is also what I am doing with my company, Wynter. If you look at SaaS, there are 53 times more companies than 10 years ago, with hundreds of tools available in any given category — think of email marketing, for instance. And a striking thing about competitors in each category is sameness: They pretty much offer the same features. In other words, differentiation based on features doesn&#8217;t work anymore. Most companies also look the same and say the same things. Sameness is the default for most companies today. Sameness is the combined effect of companies being too similar in their offers, poorly differentiated in their branding, and indistinct in their communication. You’d think that companies would be all about differentiation these days. Curiously, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Given that feature-based differentiation is a fleeting advantage, companies should compete on brand. That&#8217;s the new world we are in, and in order to win, you need to know what your audience wants and how what you’re telling your audience is landing on them. … This is what my company does, and that&#8217;s how I pitch it. As you can see, it follows the narrative I described earlier: showing how the world has changed, and explaining that what used to work is no longer adapted to the new reality that is starting to emerge.</p>
<p><strong>How would you recommend founders anchor their startup to success cases?</strong></p>
<p>Bring your best proof that the world has changed &#8212; with data to back you up &#8212; and then make a case that winning requires a new strategy. Then show winners and losers based on the strategy they have been using, and use it as new proof that it is best suited for this new world. For instance, if you are pitching product-led growth, you can give examples showing that it is working as a go-to-market strategy because we live in a new world where customers want to start using the product right away. You can give examples showing how this is working, and tie your startup to them.</p>

<p>For other examples, you could also look at what HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah does with community-led growth.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also this startup shipping hardware to remote workers, Firstbase. The Twitter timeline of its CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_herd">Chris Herd,</a> is a good example of what I am saying: Just look at how he is selling the narrative, not his company.</p>
<p>So first and foremost you sell a narrative, a point of view on the world. And only much later you explain how your company helps their customer win using this new strategy. The narrative is the context for the features, etc.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZnnZ2hZbpR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/firstbase-raises-13m-to-make-remote-work-suck-less/">Firstbase raises $13M to make remote work suck less</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>How can startups avoid getting it wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Your narrative can miss the mark if it&#8217;s not about change in the external world and only internal to the company, or if you are investing in a change that is not happening that you are failing to make sound credible. To win on brand, you need to measure the effectiveness of your narrative.</p>
<p>How do you test that? If you do direct sales, getting feedback is pretty straightforward. In my sales demo, I talk about the narrative before going into the demo. If people ask for a copy of my deck, I know it&#8217;s hitting home. I also ask for feedback, observe if people are nodding, etc. If you are not going through this sales process &#8212; for instance, if you are doing product-led growth &#8212; you need to do message testing. This can be one-on-one or as a qualitative survey, but either way, you need to make sure that you are testing on your actual target audience.</p>
<p>We do that at Wynter &#8212; you can conduct message testing as well as for customer research, so you can survey people not just on your message, but also on their perception of the world. This helps you discover what in your sales pitch on your website is hitting home, what falls flat, how it compares to the competition and so on.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>When should startups start working on their messaging?</strong></p>
<p>Companies should attach themselves to a narrative from day one because innovation is transient. Staying ahead of your competition through innovation forever is very rare. Winning on brand is more accessible. So before you have product-market fit, you need message-market fit. Potential customers will look at this. It can even be a moat: Instead of positioning yourself as a commodity (when you sell yourself through non-innovative features, you’re a commodity), you develop a story that people emotionally connect to. You&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s a moat if it makes it possible for you to charge more than your competitors. This doesn&#8217;t happen with a feature: It eventually becomes commoditized and expected. This is much less of a problem when you have a brand.</p>
<p><strong>How should the narrative evolve over time, if at all?</strong></p>
<p>Your narrative also needs to evolve as the world evolves; you always need to be scanning for what&#8217;s happening and the broader context. The rise of remote is an example of that; see, for instance, how HR company Lattice attached itself to it as it expanded from one feature to a broader offering.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r3EupwSJiR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/">Lattice, a people management platform, picks up $45M at a $400M valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lattice, a people management platform, picks up $45M at a $400M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/embed/#?secret=r3EupwSJiR" data-secret="r3EupwSJiR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This connects to a broader point, which is that we are going from mass market to smaller clusters. For example, we all used to watch the same shows, versus all the niche content that has emerged today. This can be good for startups because in most cases, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford to aim for mass-market appeal from the start anyway. But as they grow, their narrative may have to evolve. And there can also be a brand narrative and a strategic narrative at the same time, with the latter being the one that evolves over time.</p>
<p>In terms of stories, some of the ones I mentioned in my Twitter thread are more timeless, but even some of these might not work forever. For instance, the &#8220;David versus Goliath&#8221; story might not sound authentic once you reach a certain stage. I also gave the example of Wise &#8220;standing up for the people&#8221; and focusing on disrupting bank fees, but now that it is getting disrupted itself, it might have to change its narrative. Some companies don&#8217;t need to move away from their original narrative, but some do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yandex Self-Driving Group, a unit of Yandex, the publicly-traded Russian tech giant, has announced a partnership with food delivery service GrubHub to be its multi-year robotic delivery provider across American college campuses. Yandex hopes to reach over 250 campuses over the course of this partnership, beginning with dozens of robots in the fall, according to a statement from Yandex Self-Driving CEO Dmitry Polishchuk.</p>
<p>Last September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/yandex-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-from-its-uber-jv-invests-150m-into-newco/">Yandex&#8217;s self-driving unit spun out from a joint venture with Uber</a>. In May this year, the company said it clocked a total <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsilver/2021/05/03/yandex-self-driving-group-clocks-7-million-autonomous-miles/?sh=449d6ff724c2">7 million autonomous miles</a>, which was more than Waymo at the time. Yandex has been developing full-sized autonomous vehicle technology since 2017, which it&#8217;s tested in Tel Aviv, Israel and Ann Arbor, Michigan, as well as Innopolis, Russia via its robotaxi fleet. The company first began public deliveries on its six-wheeled, 150-pound robot, the Yandex.Rover, last April in Skolkovo, Russia, using the same self-driving technology stack as the company&#8217;s autonomous cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology is definitely very complicated, but we can see that it has already reached the level when it can start being deployed either in form of delivery robots or robotaxi services in small towns or specific districts of big cities,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We believe that in three to four years the technology will reach the level where the car can drive as safe and as efficient as an experienced human driver in rush hour in the center of cities like Moscow or New York.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yandex&#8217;s approach to commercialization is unique. Of all the companies developing autonomous technology for cars, Yandex is going to market with its robots first, &#8220;and it seems to be a pretty efficient way to do it,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;It took us two years to get from the idea of making a delivery robot in June 2018 to signing such a solid commercial contract,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The robots have already been tried and tested commercially in Russia via the food delivery platform Yandex.Eats and the express grocery delivery platform Yandex.Lavka. According to a statement by the company, Yandex.Rovers, which move at three to five miles per hour, can navigate pavements, pedestrian areas and crosswalks. They&#8217;re ideal for campus areas not accessible by car, and the service has already been fully integrated into the GrubHub app. From the user experience side of things, once the rover reaches its destination, the customer receives a push notification and comes outside to open the robot&#8217;s hatch through the app.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=yVwQqCRHp8" data-secret="yVwQqCRHp8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yandex says its delivery robots can operate day or night, rain or snow, in controlled or uncontrolled pedestrian crossing scenarios. The rovers operate autonomously most of the time, but if they get into a complicated situation, like getting ridden by a drunk college student, they may send a request for remote assistance, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch it has not yet branded its robots to reflect the Grubhub partnership, so hopefully its goal of getting dozens of vehicles out this fall is not too much of a reach.</p>
<p>“Together with Yandex, we’re changing the way college students experience food delivery,” said Brian Madigan, vice president of corporate and campus partners at Grubhub, in a statement. “We’re excited to offer these cost-effective, scalable and quick food ordering and delivery capabilities to colleges and universities across the country that are looking to adapt to students’ unique dining needs. While college campuses are notoriously difficult for cars to navigate, specifically as it relates to food delivery, Yandex robots easily access parts of campuses that vehicles cannot — effectively removing a major hurdle universities face when implementing new technology.”</p>
<p>Now the question is, with a post-Covid fall semester around the corner, how many of those robots will make it back to Yandex after the frat boys decide the new hazing structure involves successfully stealing or vandalizing a robot?</p>
<p>Yandex said it also intends to continue developing its robotaxi service as it moves to commercialize more arms of the business and use its AV tech in a range of scenarios.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company kicks off with a note that it has 27 million weekly active users and claims users in around one in three U.S. households. The argument, then, is that Nextdoor has scale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The SPAC parade continues in this shortened week with news that community social network Nextdoor will go public via a blank-check company. The unicorn will merge with Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. II, taking itself public and raising capital at the same time.</p>
<p>Per the former startup, the transaction with the Khosla-affiliated SPAC will generate gross proceeds of around $686 million, inclusive of a $270 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE, which is being funded by a collection of capital pools, some prior Nextdoor investors (including Tiger), Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar and Khosla Ventures itself.</p>
<p>Notably, Khosla is not a listed investor in the company per <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a> or <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a>, indicating that even SPACs formed by venture capital firms can hunt for deals outside their parent&#8217;s portfolio.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://investors.nextdoor.com/news/news-details/2021/Nextdoor-the-neighborhood-network-to-become-a-publicly-traded-company-through-merger-with-Khosla-Ventures-Acquisition-Co.-II/default.aspx">Nextdoor release</a>, the transaction will value the company at a &#8220;pro forma equity [valuation] of approximately $4.3 billion.&#8221; That&#8217;s a great price for the firm that was most recently valued at $2.17 billion in a late 2019-era Series H worth $170 million, per PitchBook data. Those funds were invested at a flat $2 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>So, what will public investors get the chance to buy into at the new, higher price? To answer that we&#8217;ll have to turn to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/517578190/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Investor_Presentation_Final.pdf">SPAC investor deck</a>.</p>
<p>Our general observations are that while Nextdoor&#8217;s SPAC deck does have some regular annoyances, it offers a clear-eyed look at the company&#8217;s financial performance both in historical terms and in terms of what it might accomplish in the future. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/spac-charts-are-exercises-in-the-limits-of-hype/">usual mockery of SPAC charts</a> mostly doesn&#8217;t apply. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<h2>Nextdoor&#8217;s SPAC pitch</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll proceed through the deck in its original slide order to better understand the company&#8217;s argument for its value today, as well as its future worth.</p>
<p>The company kicks off with a note that it has 27 million weekly active users (neighbors, in its own parlance), and claims users in around one in three U.S. households. The argument, then, is that Nextdoor has <em>scale</em>.</p>
<p>A few slides later, Nextdoor details its mission: &#8220;To cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.&#8221; While accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/bestofnextdoor">@BestOfNextdoor</a> might make this mission statement as coherent as ExxonMobil saying that its core purpose was, say, atmospheric carbon reduction, we have to take it seriously. The company <em>wants</em> to bring people together. It can&#8217;t control what they do from there, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17980866/nextdoor-bestofnextdoor-nirav-tolia-jenn-takahashi-launch">as we&#8217;ve all seen.</a> But the fact that rude people on Nextdoor is a meme stems from the same scale that the company was just crowing about.</p>
<p>Underscoring its active user counts are Nextdoor&#8217;s retention figures. Here&#8217;s how it describes that metric:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174131" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174131" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2174131 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png" alt="" width="1217" height="569" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png 1217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png?resize=768,359 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png?resize=680,318 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.51.13-PM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1217px) 100vw, 1217px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nextdoor SPAC investor deck</p></div></p>
<p>These are monthly active users, mind, not weekly active, the figure that the company cited up top. So, the metrics are looser here. And the company is counting users as active if they have &#8220;started a session or opened a content email over the trailing 30 days.&#8221; How conservative is that metric? We&#8217;ll leave that for you to decide.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s argument for its value continues in the following slide, with Nextdoor noting that users become more active as more people use the service in a neighborhood. This feels obvious, though it is nice, we suppose, to see the company codify our expectations in data.</p>
<p>Nextdoor then argues that its user base is distinct from that of other social networks and that its users are about as active as those on Twitter, albeit less active than on the major U.S. social networks (Facebook, Snap, Instagram).</p>
<p>Why go through the exercise of sorting Nextdoor into a cabal of social networks? Well, here&#8217;s why:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The increasingly intense heats bearing down feverishly across the globe are accelerating the number, scale, and complexity of disasters worldwide. Just in the past few weeks, we have seen record heat in the United States Pacific Northwest that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/06/weather/pacific-northwest-heat-wave/index.html">has led to hundreds of deaths</a> — with more heat on the way.</p>
<p>Heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes, typhoons and many other types of weather-related disasters create huge challenges for infrastructure providers like energy utilities and telecoms, who have to keep uptime as close to 100% as possible for their customers even in the midst of some of the most challenging environments humans have ever witnessed.</p>
<p>To that end, Verizon (which, as a reminder, is the ultimate parent company for TechCrunch for now) announced today the first demo unit of what it dubs its THOR vehicle, for Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response. Designed on top of a Ford F650 pickup truck chassis, THOR is designed to provide highly mobile and resilient connectivity to frontline responders and citizens through wireless technologies like 5G Ultra Wideband and satellite uplinks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2174189" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174189" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2174189" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/THOR-4.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174189" class="wp-caption-text">Verizon&#8217;s THOR vehicle can deploy wireless technologies like 5G and satellite uplinks to rapidly deploy connectivity to frontline responders. Image Credits: Verizon</p></div></p>
<p>The company developed the prototype in partnership with the Department of Defense’s NavalX and the SoCal Tech Bridge, and unveiled the prototype last week at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, just north of San Diego.</p>
<p>In addition to wireless connectivity, THOR can also potentially deploy a variety of drone capabilities. For instance, a vehicle could deploy a drone for search and rescue operations, or to help augment firefighters with intelligence on how a wildfire is developing over time.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/">discussed a few weeks ago</a>, telcos like Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are increasing spending on a variety of resiliency initiatives, ranging from the rapid staging of mobile wireless equipment to novel solutions like AT&amp;T&#8217;s FirstNet One, a dirigible capable of flying near a disaster zone to offer wireless services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today has shared a few more ideas it&#8217;s thinking about in terms of new features around conversation health and privacy. This includes a one-stop &#8220;privacy check-in&#8221; feature that would introduce Twitter&#8217;s newer conversation controls options to users, and others that would allow people to be more private on the service, or to more easily navigate between public and private tweets or their various accounts.</p>
<p>Of these, the privacy check-in feature would probably be of most use, as Twitter&#8217;s recent spurt of innovation has also made the service more complex. Over time, a centralized destination &#8212; like <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup/">Google&#8217;s</a> or Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/443357099140264"> Privacy Checkup</a> where users can adjust their privacy controls &#8212; could become a valuable addition.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Privacy sets</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#39;ve found lots of people don&#39;t know about all the conversation control and discoverability settings available to them — so how about a check-in that lets you pick among various groups of settings depending on your needs?</p>
<p>(ID in replies) <a href="https://t.co/q9En2Z2xQv">pic.twitter.com/q9En2Z2xQv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lena Emara (@LenaEmara) <a href="https://twitter.com/LenaEmara/status/1412458831444054022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s privacy check-in feature would walk users through a series of questions that help them think about how public or private they want to be on Twitter&#8217;s platform. For example, they could choose whether everyone can see their tweets or not, who&#8217;s allowed to send them direct messages, or who can tag them in photos.</p>
<p>Other new ideas under consideration include a tweak to the Compose screen to better highlight which account you&#8217;re posting from (and if it&#8217;s public), as well as another feature that would add reminders that appear when you reply to someone from a private account. The reminder would alert you that the account wouldn&#8217;t be able to see your response because your account is currently set to &#8220;protected.&#8221; It would also provide a tool to switch your tweets to public so you can participate in the conversation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Replies</p>
<p>If you have a protected account and reply to someone who isn’t following you, you may not know they can’t see your reply. So I dropped in a reminder <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f447-1f3fc.png" alt="👇🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And what do you think about making it easier to switch to Public if you DO want them to see your reply?</p>

<p>One of the more interesting concepts being considered, however, is related to your discoverability. Often, when someone is being harassed by a group, it begins to attract even more unwanted attention. While the user could report the trolls for abuse, it won&#8217;t immediately stop their attacks. To deal with this sort of troll brigade, some users set their account to private or delete their Twitter account altogether.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s potential new feature would offer a third option: making your account hidden. Users could be alerted to the increase in negative attention their account was receiving through a push notification and then be pointed to new privacy controls that would let them disable the ability for other Twitter users to find them through search. One toggle would disable people from finding your account by searching for your username while another would disable the account from being recommended under the &#8220;Who To Follow&#8221; feature. You could also set time limits on how long you want these options disabled, in case you want to hide for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>Twitter says these are, for now, just ideas &#8212; not features being built. It wants to hear from the Twitter user community what they think, and then weigh that feedback before going forward.</p>
<p>The company has been posting several other design concepts like this in recent days, including, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-considers-new-features-for-tweeting-only-to-friends-under-different-personas-and-more/">just last week, a few new ideas</a> about tweeting only to friends or using different personas, among other things. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">the company also showed off</a> concepts around a potential “unmention” feature that would let users untag themselves from others’ tweets.</p>
<p>As of yet, Twitter hasn&#8217;t made any decisions on which, if any, of its new concepts will be turned into real-world features. But they stand as another example of a company that&#8217;s been re-enegrized after years of stagnation to become more innovative, and at a much faster pace. Late last year, for example, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">launched</a> its Stories product called Fleets to all users. It has since rolled out or is soon rolling out a number of significant new products, including its audio networking service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>, a crowd-sourced factchecker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, a premium subscription called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">Twitter Blue</a>, newsletters from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">Revue</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tip jar,</a> and a creator subscription <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">called Super Follow</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">just opened applications</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot wrapped up in a name: feelings, emotions, connotation, unconscious bias, personal history. It’s an identity — it gives something meaning and importance.</p>
<p>In leading marketing and brand at <a href="https://highalpha.com/">High Alpha</a>, I think about naming quite a bit. As a venture studio, we co-found and launch five to 10 new software startups every year. It is my team’s responsibility to create and build out the brands for all the new companies we start, including everything from naming and domain acquisition to brand identity and websites. Over the past five years, we’ve named more than 30 software startups at High Alpha.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Over the past five years, we’ve named more than 30 software startups.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As a soon-to-be first-time parent, the idea of naming has taken on a whole new meaning and importance in my life. Even though I help name new companies for a living, I now fully understand the paralysis that often comes when faced with the task of deciding the name for someone or something that’s especially important to you.</p>
<p>Because of this, I’ve always tried to take an objective, pragmatic approach to naming a company with our CEOs and other startups. Naming is an incredibly difficult and nuanced process. It’s fraught with subjectiveness and personal preference. And to top it all off, most founders have zero (or very little) experience in naming.</p>
<p>The truth is that business names fall on a bell curve — you have a small number of outliers that actively contribute to your success and a small number of outliers that actively impair your ability to succeed. The vast majority, though, fall somewhere in the middle in their impact on your business.</p>
<p>So, how should a founder go about effectively naming their baby startup and not picking a name that will hurt them? I’m sharing my own criteria and lessons for how to go about naming your startup, how to evaluate a company name and what makes for a good company name.</p>
<h2>Is the name ownable?</h2>
<p>As a founder, one of the first criteria to look at is ownability and URL availability. Nowadays, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a name where the .com is still available. I oftentimes will look at .io, .co, get_______.com, or _____hq.com as my top alternatives to a .com, but I always still prefer if the .com is <em>potentially</em> attainable in the future. It may be parked by a domain investor or someone asking a ridiculous price, but that’s always better than an established business using your .com. If not, you will always be fighting a search battle with some other brand that owns your .com.</p>
<p>This goes much further than just the availability of the coveted .com domain, though. You should evaluate the competitiveness and search congestion around your branded keywords. A company named “Apple” or “Lumber” is going to have a really hard time competing for search placements, even if they don’t sell computers or building supplies. An established name and word is also going to come with existing connotations and previous experiences in your audience’s mind. You want a name free from as much baggage as possible so you can easily build your own connotations and memories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After several years of fighting and jockeying for position by the biggest cloud infrastructure companies in the world, the Pentagon finally pulled the plug on the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">winner-take-all, $10 billion JEDI contract</a> today. In the end, nobody won.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shifting technology environment, it has become clear that the JEDI cloud contract, which has long been delayed, no longer meets the requirements to fill the DoD&#8217;s capability gaps,&#8221; a Pentagon spokesperson stated.</p>
<p>The contract procurement process began in 2018 with a call for RFPs for a $10 billion, decade-long contract to handle the cloud infrastructure strategy for The Pentagon. Pentagon spokesperson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">Heather Babb told TechCrunch</a> why they were going with the. single-winner approach: &#8220;Single award is advantageous because, among other things, it improves security, improves data accessibility and simplifies the Department’s ability to adopt and use cloud services,” she said at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the start though, companies objected to the single-winner approach, believing that the Pentagon would be better served with a multi-vendor approach. Some companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/much-to-oracles-chagrin-pentagon-names-microsoft-and-amazon-as-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-finalists/">particularly Oracle believed</a> the procurement process was designed to favor Amazon.</p>
<p>In the end it came down to a pair of finalists &#8212; Amazon and Microsoft &#8212; and in the end <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">Microsoft won</a>. But Amazon believed that it had superior technology and only lost the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">because of direct interference by the previous president</a> who had open disdain for then-CEO Jeff Bezos (who is also the owner of the Washington Post newspaper).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DoD reaffirms Microsoft has won JEDI cloud contract, but Amazon legal complaints still pending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/dod-reaffirms-microsoft-has-won-jedi-cloud-contract-but-amazon-legal-complaints-still-pending/embed/#?secret=0dW0xskJV8" data-secret="0dW0xskJV8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon decided to fight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/in-latest-jedi-contract-drama-aws-files-motion-to-stop-work-on-project/">the decision in court</a>, and after months of delay, the Pentagon made the decision that it was time to move on. In <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/06/microsofts-commitment-to-the-dod-remains-steadfast/">a blog post</a>, Microsoft took a swipe at Amazon for precipitating the delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 20 months since DoD selected Microsoft as its JEDI partner highlights issues that warrant the attention of policymakers: When one company can delay, for years, critical technology upgrades for those who defend our nation, the protest process needs reform. Amazon filed its protest in November 2019 and its case was expected to take at least another year to litigate and yield a decision, with potential appeals afterward,&#8221; Microsoft wrote in its blog post about the end of the deal.</p>
<p>But in a statement of its own, Amazon reiterated its belief that the process was not fairly executed. &#8220;We understand and agree with the DoD’s decision. Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement. Our commitment to supporting our nation’s military and ensuring that our warfighters and defense partners have access to the best technology at the best price is stronger than ever. We look forward to continuing to support the DoD’s modernization efforts and building solutions that help accomplish their critical missions,&#8221; a company spokesperson said.</p>
<p>It seems like a fitting end to a project that I felt was doomed from the beginning. From the moment the Pentagon announced this contract with the cutesy twist on the Star Wars name, the procurement process has taken more twists and turns than a TV soap.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was a lot of sound and fury and it led to a lot of nothing. We move onto whatever cloud procurement process happens next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Part of the complex process that turns raw materials into finished products like detergents, cosmetics and flavors relies on enzymes, which facilitate chemical transformations. But finding the right enzyme for a new or proposed drug or additive is a drawn out and almost random process &#8212; which <a href="https://allozymes.com/">Allozymes</a> aims to change with a remarkable new system that could set a new standard in the industry, and has raised a $5 million seed round to commercialize.</p>
<p>Enzymes are chains of amino acids, the &#8220;building blocks of life&#8221; among the many things encoded in DNA. These large, complex molecules bind to other substances in a way that facilitates a chemical reaction, say turning sugars in a cell into a more usable form of energy.</p>
<p>One also finds enzymes in the world of manufacturing, where major companies have identified and isolated enzymes that perform valuable work like taking some cheap base ingredients and making them combine into a more useful form. Any company that sells or needs lots of any particular chemical that doesn&#8217;t appear abundantly in nature probably has enzymatic processes to aid in creating more of it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s just an enzyme for everything. When you&#8217;re inventing new molecules from scratch, like a novel drug or flavoring, there&#8217;s no reason why there should be a naturally occurring enzyme that reacts with or creates it. No animal synthesizes allergy medicine in its cells, so companies must find or create new enzymes that do what&#8217;s needed. The problem is that enzymes are generally at least 100 units long, and there are 20 amino acids to choose from, meaning for even the simplest novel enzyme you&#8217;re looking at uncountably numerous variations.</p>
<p>By starting with known enzymes and systematically working through variations that seem intuitively like they might work, researchers have been able to find new and useful enzymes, but the process is complex and slow even when fully automated: at most a couple hundred a day, and that&#8217;s if you happen to have a top-of-the-line robotic lab.</p>
<p>So when Allozymes comes in with a claim that it can screen up to <em>ten million</em> per day, you can imagine the level of change that represents.</p>

<p>Allozymes was founded by Peyman Salehian (CEO) and Akbar Vahidi (CTO), two Iranian chemical engineers who met while pursuing their PhDs at the National University of Singapore. The three years of research leading up to the commercial product also occurred at NUS, which holds the patent and exclusively licenses it to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state of the art hasn&#8217;t changed in 20 years,&#8221; said Salehian. &#8220;When we talk with big pharma, they have whole departments for this, they have $2 million robots, and it still takes a year to get a new enzyme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Allozymes platform will speed up the process by several orders of magnitude, while <em>decreasing</em> the cost by an order of magnitude, Salehian said. If these estimates bear out, it effectively trivializes the enzyme search and obsoletes billions in investments and infrastructure. Why pay more to get less?</p>
<p>Traditionally, enzymes are isolated and selected over a multi-step process that involves introducing DNA templates into cells, which are cultured to create the target enzymes, which once a certain growth state is achieved, are analyzed robotically. If there are promising results, you go down that road with more variations, otherwise you start again from the beginning. There&#8217;s a lot of picking and placing little dishes, waiting for enough cells to produce enough of the stuff, and so on.</p>

<p>The process, designed by Vahidi and other researchers at NUS, is fully contained with a benchtop device, and generates almost no waste. Instead of using culture dishes, the device puts the necessary cells, substrate, and other ingredients in a tiny droplet in a microfluidic system. The reactions occur inside this little drop, which is incubated, tracked, and eventually collected and tested in a fraction of the time a larger sample would take.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/allo-1.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2174082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/allo-1.gif" alt="Animation showing droplets moving through a microfluidic system." width="700" height="698" /></a></p>
<p>Allozymes isn&#8217;t selling the device, though. It&#8217;s enzyme engineering as a service, and for now their partners and customers seem content with that. Its primary service is cut-to-size, depending on the needs of the project. For instance, maybe a company has a working enzyme already and just wants a variant that&#8217;s easier to synthesize or less dependent on certain expensive additives. With a solid starting point and flexible goal that might be a project on the smaller side. Another company may be looking to completely replace hard chemistry processes in their manufacturing, know the start and the end of the process but need an enzyme to fill in the gaps; that might be a more wide ranging and expensive project.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174092" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174092" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg?resize=251,300 251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg?resize=768,919 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg?resize=568,680 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peyman-and-Akbar-6.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174092" class="wp-caption-text">Peyman Salehian, left, and Akbar Vahidi.</p></div></p>
<p>Vahidi explained that the goal is not to &#8220;democratize&#8221; enzyme engineering. It&#8217;s still expensive and large-scale enough that it will primarily be done by large companies, but now they can get a hundred thousand times more out of their R&amp;D dollar. The speed and value put them above the competition, said Salehian, with companies like Codexis, Arzeda, and Ginkgo Bioworks also doing enzyme bioengineering but at lower rates and with different priorities.</p>
<p>Occasionally the company might strike a bargain to take part ownership of an IP or product, but that&#8217;s not really the business model, Salehian said. Some early work consisted of actually making the final compound, but ultimately the core product is expected to be the service. (Still, a million-dollar order is nothing to sneeze at.)</p>
<p>It may have occurred to you that in the process of doing a job, Allozymes might sort through hundreds of millions of enzymes. Rest assured, they are well aware of the value these may represent. The service transitions seamlessly into the inevitable data play.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a big data set that shows &#8216;if you change this amino acid this will be the function,&#8217; you don&#8217;t even need to engineer it, you can eliminate it [i.e. from consideration]. You can even design enzymes if you know enough,&#8221; Salehian said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent $5 million seed round was led by Xora Innovation (from Temasek, Singapore&#8217;s sovereign fund), with participation from SOSV&#8217;s HAX, Entrepreneur First and TI Platform Management. Salehian explained that they planned to incorporate in the U.S. following interest from American venture firms, but Temasek&#8217;s early-stage investor convinced them to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biotransformation is in huge demand on this side of the world,&#8221; Salehian said. &#8220;Chemical, agriculture, and food companies need to do it, but no platform company can deliver these services. So we tried to fill that gap.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here’s the theory: Instead of linking carbon and biodiversity <em>credits</em> to the sale of raw materials such as forests, which cause CO2, what if you linked them to crypto tokens, and thus kept these CO2-producing materials in the ground?</p>
<p>That’s the theory behind <a href="http://Single.Earth">Single.Earth</a>, which has now raised a $7.9 million seed funding round led by Swedish VC EQT Ventures to, in its own words, &#8216;tokenize nature’. Also participating in the round was existing investor Icebreaker, and Ragnar Sass and Martin Henk, founders of Pipedrive. The funding will be used to launch its marketplace for nature-backed MERIT tokens.</p>
<p>Single.Earth says its &#8216;nature-backed&#8217; financial system will use using MERIT tokens. Given the market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth more than $50 billion by 2030 and crypto surpassed a $2 trillion market cap in 2021, their plan might just work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It plans to build a &#8216;digital twin&#8217; of nature that reveals how much any area of ecological significance in the world absorbs CO2 and retains biodiversity. Using environmental data such as satellite imagery, it aims to build global carbon models on which to base its token marketplace, generating profits through carbon compensations, &#8216;mining&#8217; a new MERIT token for every 100 kg of CO2 sequestered in a specific forest or biodiverse area.</p>
<p>The MERIT tokens are then used to trade, compensate for a CO2 footprint, or contribute to climate goals (as the token is ‘used up’ and cannot be traded anymore). Companies, organisations, and eventually individuals will be able purchase these tokens and own fractional amounts of natural resources, rewarded with carbon and biodiversity offsets. The company says the market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth more than $50 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>Because of the traceability of blockchain and its link to a tradable token, payment to landowners would be immediate.</p>
<p>Single.Earth was co-founded in 2019 by CEO Merit Valdsalu and CTO Andrus Aaslaid. Valdsalu said: “Nature conservation is scalable, accessible, and makes sense financially; what’s more, it’s vital to engineer a systematic change.”</p>
<p>Sandra Malmberg, Venture Lead at EQT Ventures, added: “Oil was the new gold, data the new oil; now, nature is now the most precious and valuable resource of all. A company having a hectare of forest saved as a key metric to scale is a company we are thrilled to back. Disrupting the economy and financial markets with a new tradable and liquid asset class that has a positive impact on the environment is an irresistible investment.”</p>

Jeff Bezos is heading up in his company&#8217;s own phallic reusable rocket on July 20, which means if all goes to schedule, Branson will beat him by just over a week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you find you have a hard time mustering a lot of enthusiasm or really any feelings at all about these two grown man boys burning cash in a race to be the first billionaire to spend a couple minutes at an altitude technically considered &#8216;space&#8217; by a more or less arbitrary definition, then congratulations: You should not care. No one should, and yet here we are, writing and reading about it in a newsletter.</p>
<p>These &#8216;events&#8217; will be worth watching because of the technical achievements they represent for the companies involved, and the teams that worked hard on making sure either spacecraft is able to safely transport humans to space; the billionaires on board are mere chattel, weight and mass simulators that can provide a surprisingly good, but not altogether perfect, simulacrum of a human passenger.</p>
<p>Elon actually wins some rare kudos for not apparently giving much of a shit about this particular bro off.</p>

<p>SpaceX and Virgin Orbit have delivered payloads on behalf of paying customers this past week — par for the course for the former, but a novel experience for the latter. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/spacex-delivers-88-satellites-to-orbit-lands-first-stage-onshore-for-first-time-in-2021/">SpaceX sent up 85 satellites on behalf of customers</a> during its second official rideshare mission, along with three of its own, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/">Virgin Orbit launched its first official commercial mission</a> (after its successful demonstration launch earlier this year), carrying a number of small satellites including the first ever for the Netherlands military.</p>
<p>If Virgin Orbit succeeds in ramping its operations according to its plan, a week like this with multiple launches from a number of commercial launch providers capable of sending up small satellites might become a lot more common. Virgin Orbit joins SpaceX and Rocket Lab now as having the potential to fly on any given week, and others are hot on their heels, including Astra (which is now an officially publicly traded company) and Relativity.</p>
<p>Speaking of that last one,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/relativity-space-will-open-a-1-million-square-foot-factory-to-scale-terran-r-production/"> Relativity announced a new 1 million square foot factory</a> that will house a lot of its massive 3D printers to ramp up production of its larger Terran R rocket. The company has yet to fly its Terran 1, the first of its 3D printed spacecraft, but that&#8217;s still on track to happen later this year.</p>

<p>Elon Musk virtually joined the MWC conference in Barcelona to talk about Starlink, and when asked what success for the bourgeoning global connectivity service would look like, he said that essentially they&#8217;ll be happy if it doesn&#8217;t go bankrupt. Then, if they can jump that hurdle, they&#8217;ll start thinking longer term.</p>
<p>He pointed out that everyone who has tried to do what Starlink is trying to do so far has gone bust, and admitted that the company has probably already sunk between $5 and $10 billion into its work on the constellation and service so far, with another $30 billion expected to be invested long-term. He also pointed out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/spacex-is-losing-money-on-its-starlink-terminals-but-sees-lower-costs-ahead/">that the $500 terminal and modem kit customers need to buy to get connected actually costs SpaceX over $1,000 to produce</a>, so it&#8217;s selling them at a significant loss for now.</p>
<p>Starlink could be a big source of ongoing revenue, and more consistent and predictable than the launch business, but it&#8217;s obviously going to take a long time to get there. Now it make sense why the company is launching Starlink satellites with such frequency, as it aims for global coverage, and the larger customer base that brings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The war between Box’s current leadership and activist shareholder Starboard took a new turn today with a detailed timeline outlining the two groups’ relationship, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001372612/000138713121007146/box-prec14a_070121.htm">thanks to an SEC filing</a> and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/box-files-preliminary-proxy-statement-123900526.html">companion press release</a>. Box is pushing back against a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">slate of board candidates</a> put forth by Starboard, which wants to shake up the company’s leadership and sell it.</p>
<p>The SEC filing details a lengthy series of phone calls, meetings and other communications between the technology company and Starboard, which has held a stake in Box greater than 5% since September of 2019. Since then shares of Box have risen by around $10 per share.</p>
<p>Today’s news is multi-faceted, but we’ve learned more concerning Starboard’s demands that Box sell itself; how strongly the investor wanted co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie to be fired; and that the company’s complaints about a KKR-led investment into Box that it used to repurchase its shares did not match its behavior, in that Starboard asked to participate in the transaction despite its public statements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Activist investors, a bit like short-sellers, are either groups that you generally like or do not. In this case, however, we can learn quite a lot from the Box filing. Including the sheer amount of time and communication that it takes to manage such an investor from the perspective of one of its public-market investments.</p>

<p>What follows are key excerpts from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001372612/000138713121007146/box-prec14a_070121.htm">Box’s SEC filing</a> on the matter, starting with its early stake and early agreement with Starboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On September 3, 2019, representatives of Starboard contacted Mr. Levie to inform Mr. Levie that Starboard would be filing a</em></li>
<li><em>Schedule 13D with the SEC reporting a 7.5% ownership stake in the company.</em></li>
<li><em>On March 9, 2020, Mr. O’Driscoll and Ms. Barsamian had a call with representatives of Starboard to discuss entering into a settlement agreement with Starboard.</em></li>
<li><em>On March 22, 2020, the company and Starboard entered into an agreement[.]</em><br />
<em>Also on March 23, 2020, Starboard reported beneficial ownership of 7.7% of the outstanding Class A common stock.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Box <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2020/Box-Reports-Revenue-of-1836-Million-for-Fiscal-First-Quarter-2021-Up-13-Percent-Year-Over-Year/">reported earnings</a>, which Starboard appeared to praise:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On May 27, 2020, the company reported its fiscal first quarter results, noting a 13% increase in year-over-year revenue, a 900 basis point increase in year-over-year GAAP operating margin and a $36.4 million increase in year-over-year cash flow from operations. Peter Feld, a representative of Starboard, and Mr. Levie had an email conversation related to the company’s first quarter results in which Mr. Feld stated “you guys are on a good path…congrats to the team and keep it up.”</em></li>
<li><em>Also on May 29, 2020, Starboard reported that it had decreased its beneficial ownership to 6.0% of the outstanding Class A common stock.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The same pattern repeated during Box’s <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2020/Box-Reports-Revenue-of-192-Million-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2021-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/default.aspx">next earnings report</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On August 27, 2020, Mr. Levie, Mr. Smith and company IR discussed the company’s earnings release with Starboard. Starboard indicated it was pleased with the rate of margin expansion and where the company was heading. In an email exchange between Mr. Feld and Mr. Levie related to the company’s results, Mr. Feld stated that he was “thrilled to see the company breaking out and performing better both on the top and bottom line. Appreciate you guys working with us and accepting the counsel. Not everyone behaves that way and it is greatly appreciated. Shows your comfort as a leader and a willingness to adapt. Very impressive.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Box <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2020/Box-Reports-Revenue-of-196-Million-for-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2021-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/">reported its next quarter’s results,</a> which was followed by a change in message from Starboard (emphasis TechCrunch):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On December 1, 2020, the company announced its fiscal third quarter results, noting an 11% increase in year-over-year revenue, an improvement of 2100 basis points in year-over-year GAAP operating margin and a $36 million increase in year-over-year cash flow from operations. <strong>The company also provided guidance regarding its fiscal fourth quarter results, noting that its revised revenue guidance was due to “lower professional services bookings than we noted previously, which creates a roughly $2 million headwind” and that the company was being “prudent in our growth expectations given the macroeconomic challenges that our customers are facing.” The revised guidance for revenue was 1.1% below analysts’ consensus estimates of $198.8 million.</strong></em></li>
<li><em>On December 2, 2020, Box’s common stock declined approximately 9% from its prior close of $18.54 to $16.91. On December 2, 2020 and December 4, 2020, Mr. Levie, Mr. Smith and Box IR discussed the company’s earnings release with representatives of Starboard. Despite the prior support Mr. Feld communicated to the company, Starboard reversed course and demanded that the company explore a sale of the entire company or fire the company’s CEO, or otherwise face a proxy contest from Starboard. Mr. Feld further stated that the company should not turn down an offer from a third party to buy the entire company “in the low twenties” and that Starboard would be a seller at such a price.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that Box shares are now in the mid-$26s. At the time, however, Box shares lost value (emphasis: TechCrunch)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On December 16, 2020, two weeks after earnings, the company’s stock price closed at $18.85, which was above where it was trading immediately prior to the announcement of the company’s fiscal third quarter results on December 1, 2020.</em></li>
<li><em>On January 11, 2021, Starboard disclosed that it had increased its beneficial ownership to 7.9% of the outstanding Class A common stock.</em></li>
<li><em>On January 15, 2021, Mr. Lazar and Ms. Barsamian had a call with representatives from Starboard. Mr. Feld expressed his view that, while the company’s Convertible Senior Notes were executed on favorable terms, he was not supportive of the transaction. <strong>He reiterated his demand that the company sell itself and indicated that if the company did not do so then it must replace its CEO or otherwise face a proxy contest from Starboard to replace the CEO</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few months, Box bought SignRequest, <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2021-Revenue-of-771-Million-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/default.aspx">reported earnings</a>, and engaged external parties to try to help it bolster shareholder value. Then the KKR deal came onto the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On March 31, 2021, the Strategy Committee met to discuss the status of the strategic review. At such time, the Strategy Committee was in receipt of a proposal from KKR pursuant to which KKR and certain partners would make an investment in the form of convertible preferred stock at an initial yield of 3%, which had been negotiated down from KKR’s proposal of 7% yield in its preliminary indication of interest in early March.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The deal was unanimously approved by Box’s board, and announced on April 8th, 2021. Starboard was not stoked about the transaction, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Later on April 8, 2021, Ms. Mayer and Mr. Lazar had a call with representatives of Starboard. Mr. Feld expressed Starboard’s strong displeasure with the results of the strategic review. During the conversation, Mr. Feld indicated that he would stop the fight immediately if Mr. Levie were replaced.</em></li>
<li><em>On April 14, 2021, Ms. Mayer, Mr. Lazar and Ms. Barsamian had a call with Mr. Feld. Despite his prior statements, Mr. Feld now indicated that Starboard was not willing to sell its shares of Class A common stock at $21 or $22 per share. Mr. Feld requested that the company release KKR from its obligation to vote in favor of the company as a gesture of good faith. Mr. Feld reiterated Starboard’s desire to replace Mr. Levie as CEO and indicated that he would like to join the Board of Directors if the company did so. Ms. Mayer offered Mr. Feld the opportunity to execute a non-disclosure agreement to receive more information about the strategic review process, which Mr. Feld immediately declined.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Box was like, all right, but Feld doesn’t get to be on the board:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On April 20, 2021, Ms. Mayer and Mr. Lazar had a call with representatives of Starboard. Mr. Feld stated that Starboard would not move forward with its planned director nominations if Starboard were offered the opportunity to participate in the KKR-Led Transaction and Mr. Feld were appointed to the Board of Directors. Mr. Feld reiterated that he was not willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</em></li>
<li><em>On April 27, 2021, Mr. Park had a discussion with Mr. Feld. During this conversation, Mr. Feld reiterated his desire for Starboard to participate as an investor in the KKR-Led Transaction.</em></li>
<li><em>On April 28, 2021, Ms. Mayer and Mr. Lazar informed Mr. Feld that the Board of Directors was amenable to allowing Starboard to participate in the KKR-Led Transaction but would not appoint Mr. Feld as a director. Mr. Feld indicated that there is no path to a settlement that doesn’t include appointing him to the Board of Directors.</em></li>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starboard Value puts Box on notice that it&#8217;s looking to take over board&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/embed/#?secret=c3XMZM3Rwg" data-secret="c3XMZM3Rwg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And then Starboard initiated a proxy war.</p>
<p>What to make of all of this? That trying to shake up a company from the position of a minority stake is not impossible, with Starboard able to exercise influence on Box despite having a sub-10% ownership position. And that Box was not willing to put a person on the board that wanted to fire its CEO.</p>
<p>What’s slightly silly about all of this is that the fight is coming at a time when Box is doing better than it has in some time. Its profitability has improved greatly, and in its most recent quarter the company topped expectations and raised its forward financial guidance.</p>
<p>There were times in Box’s history when it may have deserved a whacking for poor performance, but now? It’s slightly weird. Also recall that Starboard has already made quite a lot of money on its Box stake, with the company’s value appreciating sharply since the investor bought in.</p>
<p>Most media coverage is surrounding the public criticism by Starboard of the KKR deal and its private demand to be let into the deal. That dynamic is easily explained: Starboard thought that the deal wouldn’t make it money, but later decided that it could. So it changed its tune; if you are expecting an investor to do anything but try to maximize returns, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>
<p>A person close to the company told TechCrunch that the current situation should be a win-win for everyone involved, but Starboard is not seeing it that way. “If you&#8217;re a near term shareholder, [like Starboard] then the path Box has taken has already been better. And if you&#8217;re a long term shareholder, Box sees significantly more upside. [&#8230;] So overwhelmingly, the company believes this is the best path for shareholders and it&#8217;s already been proven out to be that,” the person said.</p>

<p>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at the Deep Analysis, who has been watching the content management space for many years, says the battle isn’t much of a surprise given that the two have been at odds pretty much from the start of the relationship.</p>
<p>“Like any activist investor Starboard is interested in a quick increase in shareholder values and a flip. Box is in it for the long run. Further, it seems that Starboard may have mistimed or miscalculated their moves, Box clearly was not as weak as they appeared to believe and Box has been doing well over the past year. Bringing in KKR was the start of a big fight back, and the proposed changes couldn’t make it any clearer that they are fed up with Starboard and ready to fight back hard,” Pelz-Sharpe said.</p>
<p>He added that publicly revealing details of the two companies&#8217; interactions is a bit unusual, but he thinks it was appropriate here.</p>
<p>“Actually naming and shaming, detailing Starboard&#8217;s moves and seemingly contradictory statements, is unusual but it may be effective. Starboard won’t back down without a fight, but from an investor relations/PR perspective this looks bad for them and it may well be time to walk away. That being said, I wouldn’t bet on Starboard walking away, as Silicon Valley has a habit of moving forward when they should be walking back from increasingly damaging situations&#8221;</p>
<p>What comes next is a vote on Box’s board makeup, which should happen later this summer. Let’s see who wins.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that we attempted to contact Starboard Value, but as of publication they had not gotten back to us. Box indicated that the press release and SEC filing speak for themselves.</p>
