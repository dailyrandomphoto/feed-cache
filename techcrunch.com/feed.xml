										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-menon-0b87b141/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vijay Menon</a>, a statistician by trade, began his career at Microsoft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there that he realized there was an astounding number of subscriptions that failed to renew or even go through to begin with due to payment-related issues. He became intrigued by the problem, and solving it. Ultimately in 2016 alone, he helped the company recover over 10 million Xbox Live subscriptions, which resulted in over $100 million in recovered revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his subsequent roles at Dropbox and Scribd, Menon realized the problem of accidental payment churn was not exclusive to Microsoft. It was a challenge that plagued all B2B SaaS businesses.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every subscription company deals with this black hole,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment failure, in fact, is the among the biggest causes of customer churn and represents nearly half of all subscription churn. Even more alarming, Menon came to understand, the companies weren’t even aware of what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">False declines are estimated to be a $443 billion problem by the end of this year, according to </span><a href="https://www.cardinalcommerce.com/content-hub/industry-news/false-declines-heres-the-true-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), resulting in millions of lost subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accidental churn is often not just due to problems with renewals, where people get frustrated by failed attempts to charge their credit card, for example. It is also largely a problem at the sign-up process, especially in countries outside the U.S., where charges are often falsely declined due to being attempted in another country. To Menon, it was a massive market severely underserved by traditional payment service providers such as Stripe who are strong domestically, but in his view, were poor at clearing international payments in growing markets like Brazil, India and Mexico. Menon estimates that on average, 4% of subscription customers are lost to legitimate payments failing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers outside the U.S. might be clicking submit on a given, but if they&#8217;re using a card form that&#8217;s configured for the U.S., they could be getting rejected, and “no one&#8217;s really checking on what happens after the user drops off,” Menon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2020, he teamed up with venture studio Atomic to found </span><a href="https://www.butterpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup aimed at helping companies retain existing customers and sign on new ones by preventing this accidental payment churn. Using machine learning, Butter aims to end the churn by preventing drop-off from legitimate payments.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atomic has launched 14 startups in the last 12 months (and they&#8217;re getting funded); here&#8217;s how it works&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/talking-atomic/embed/#?secret=9XzM6KQFdt" data-secret="9XzM6KQFdt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on two problems that can affect any subscription business, which is basically ‘how do I check out a payment upfront and make sure that payment actually goes through?,’ ” Menon told TechCrunch. “The other part is, what do we do when a payment fails?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup has raised $7.5 million, largely from Atomic, to tackle the problem. In a year’s time, it has also signed on about a dozen consumer subscription companies, including some large names (which he declined to reveal publicly), doing $10 million to $500 million in revenue &#8212; many of which have an international user base. It claims that it helps these companies find, on average, $1 million of revenue per year.</span></p>
<p>Its revenue-sharing model is designed to align incentives with those of its customers. It charges a percentage of what it saves for its customers. For example, Menon estimates that a $100 million ARR company would be able to see $1 to $4 million in ARR lift which is a lot, and a $500 million ARR company, around $2.5 to $5 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economy increasingly reliant on subscription models places new challenges on existing payment systems that are typically out of date, complicated, vary by country and constantly changing based on new fraud rules, according to Menon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even massive companies like Netflix and Spotify who have invested significant internal resources &#8211; payments engineering teams &#8211; in this problem, struggle because the payment landscape changes so frequently,” Menon told TechCrunch. “The Butter payments intelligence platform was built to scout through obscure payments networks to find what is broken.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241588" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241588" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241588 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Techcrunch_Butter_Main@2x.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Butter</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter plans to use its new capital to do “top of the funnel optimization,” according to Menon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a consumer checks out, there are about 128 different data elements that can be presented with every payload, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re investing into the capabilities that will be able to make decisions [around those elements] in real time so that these folks coming in through the funnel will have a much higher likelihood of that payment going through,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long term, he said, the company aims to build an AWS, or operating system, for payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to build a connective tissue for the entire payments ecosystem. We sit above what we call the payment service providers so we’re not Stripe, we’re not Braintree, we’re sitting above them,” Menon explained. “We want to work with any company, regardless of your payments stack is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also, naturally, plans to do more hiring. Recently, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billhoppin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Hoppin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the company as a co-founder and COO. Butter expects to have about 50 employees by the end of Q1 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Abraham, CEO and managing partner of Atomic, described Menon as an “exceptional” founder with unique firsthand experience inside the payments systems of some of the largest global consumer subscription businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We co-founded Butter with Vijay and the team to solve some of the most critical conversion and churn issues that all businesses face, large or small, and a short time in the company is off to an incredible start,” he wrote via-email.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-devops-guru-for-rds-to-detect-diagnose-and-resolve-amazon-aurora-related-issues-using-ml/">announced</a> a new service that makes it easier for its users to detect, diagnose and resolve issues in their relational databases. DevOps Guru for RDS, AWS&#8217;s fully managed relational database platform, is part of AWS&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/">DevOps Guru</a> family, which launched last year with a service for detecting issues with machine learning services.</p>
<p>As Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, Amazon AI, argued in his keynote today, being good at managing databases is not a differentiating factor for most businesses, so a lot of them naturally gravitate toward managed services in the cloud. But even so, these customers would still like to see more automation tools for managing these services, especially around diagnosing performance issues, Sivasubramanian noted.</p>

<p>DevOps Guru for RDS helps these users detect issues when performance metrics spike for some reason. The service looks at the activity in the database and flags anything unusual. But what&#8217;s probably most important is that the service then also performs a root cause analysis to recommend changes and &#8212; whenever possible &#8212; it will even automatically remediate issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dating app giant Match has settled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/tinder-match-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> with a group of Tinder founders and executives for $441 million. The suit, filed in 2018, <a href="https://www.tindercase.com/">had alleged</a> that IAC and its then-subsidiary Match Group had manipulated financial data in order to create a false, &#8220;lowball valuation&#8221; of the dating app when Tinder was merged into IAC in 2017. The employees also said they had been unlawfully stripped of their Tinder stock options. The suit had sought &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; in damages at the time of its filing.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case included Tinder&#8217;s co-founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen, as well as  James Kim, the vice president of finance, and Rosette Pambakian, the vice president of marketing and communications.</p>
<p>Match, naturally, had dismissed the allegations as &#8220;meritless,&#8221; noting that Tinder&#8217;s valuation had been determined in a contractually-defined valuation process that involved two independent global banks. It had vowed to vigorously defend itself against the allegations in court.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the case proceeded, the court dismissed some of the plaintiffs&#8217; claims, like those that alleged the merger was not lawful, that product releases were wrongfully delayed, and those requesting damages for wrongful contract beyond breach of contract.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000891103/000089110321000093/mtch-20211201.htm">an SEC filing</a> published today, Match Group announced its settlement agreement. The company has agreed to pay the plaintiffs $441 million and in return, the plaintiffs will dismiss all claims on trial and in arbitration related to the 2017 Tinder valuation. Match Group said it will pay the settlement from cash on hand. The company had about $510 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the third quarter, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Match+Group+%28MTCH%29+Tinder+Settlement+Removes+Major+Overhang+-+Truist/19294670.html">per</a> Truist analyst Youssef Squali. (The quarterly <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ef9ecaab-bd08-4a79-b068-a216debc0c02.pdf">filing</a> shows $511.3 million as of Sept. 30).</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement also offered a media statement from the parties, which read: &#8220;The parties are pleased to announce that they have settled the valuation lawsuit presently on trial in New York Supreme Court and the related valuation arbitration.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the settlement didn&#8217;t result in the billions in damages that the plaintiffs had originally wanted, $441 million is not exactly a small number &#8212; especially for a case that Match had repeatedly dismissed as &#8220;meritless.&#8221; However, going to trial can also be expensive for a company and this suit has been hanging over Match&#8217;s head for years, costing tens of millions of dollars, Squali noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is deepening its commitment to operate a vertically integrated battery supply chain with the announcement that it would form a joint venture with South Korea-based POSCO Chemical to build a new cathode active material facility in North America by 2024.</p>
<p>Cathode active materials comprise around 40% of the cost of electric vehicle batteries, and the majority of both cathodes and anodes (the other building block of lithium-ion batteries) are produced in China, according to <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a>. This latest announcement brings the automaker one step closer to its goal of moving the majority of its battery production footprint to North America by 2025 &#8212; a huge geographical shakeup compared to where the battery supply chain exists today.</p>
<p>“We need to control our own destiny, especially when it comes to battery production,” GM executive Doug Parks said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “That’s why we’re pursuing a North America-focused vertical integration strategy for our proprietary platform.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GM has already aggressively pursued control of the remainder of the battery supply chain, including battery cell production with Ultium, its JV with LG Energy Solution, and its battery recycling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/">agreement with Li-Cycle</a>. The materials from this facility will go straight into the production of new Ultium battery cells &#8212; a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) battery that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">forms the bedrock</a> of the automaker’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion electrification strategy</a>.</p>
<p>While company executives declined to specify where the plant will be located or the size of the investment, it’s almost certain to be significant. That’s because the materials produced by the new facility will supply “most” of the cathode active material needed for all four of the battery manufacturing facilities GM has planned under its Ultium JV. That will eventually bring the automaker to a total of 140 gigawatt-hours of cell manufacturing capacity in the United States.</p>
<p>The joint venture will have to move quickly if it wants the new facility to be up and running by 2024. The two companies said a site location could be announced as early as the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>GM’s vertical integration strategy comes amid the ongoing chip shortage, which continues to affect industries from auto to consumer electronics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If anything, the semiconductor crisis has taught us that we need to have agility,” Parks said.</p>
<p>He added that moving more of the supply chain &#8212; including raw materials sourcing &#8212; to North America could help address some of the more painful realities of battery production, like human rights abuses in cobalt sourcing or environmental impacts.</p>
<p>“We think that the supply chain can be improved from what it is today, both from a security standpoint &#8212; a locational security, I&#8217;ll call that the North American approach &#8212; as well as environmental,” Parks said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven if the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1">AirPeak S1</a> slipped your mind. It’s been a long, weird 13 or so months since Sony first teased the pro-level drone. After a November 2020 reveal, the company offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-unveils-airpeak-its-camera-carrying-video-drone/">some more information on its first profession UAV</a> way back this year’s all-virtual CES in January and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8KA55Vu07c">an official &#8220;launch&#8221; in June</a>. Since then, it’s been mostly radio silence.</p>
<p>That is, until this morning, when Sony announced the AirPeak will be hitting a 2021 launch – just under the wire. Pre-orders on the product open today, with an estimated ship date of December 24 – so a slightly belated Christmas arrival for the cinematographer in your life who has everything (we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">somehow missed that gift guide this year</a>).</p>
<p>As anticipated, Sony’s enter won’t come cheap, with a suggested retail price of $9,000. Along with a quadcopter designed to fly around Sony’s extremely good mirrorless cameras, that price gets you two pairs of propellers, two batteries, a charger and a remote.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241552" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8KA55Vu07c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The aforementioned cameras, lenses – and the gimbal for said cameras – are both sold separately. The gimbal runs another $2,200. While you’re at it, might as well toss in another $300 for a year of “Airpeak Plus,” for cloud storage of projects, geofencing and the like.</p>
<p>Sony’s not quite ready to go head to head with DJI, which currently controls an estimated 70% of the global drone market. But the play here is clear, as it looks like to capitalize on the success of its imaging line by designing a custom rig specifically for its cameras.</p>
<p>The Airpeak S1 is compatible with the Alpha 1, Alpha 7S, Alpha 7R s, Alpha 9 and FX3 cameras, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The final member of an international hacking group known as ‘The Community’ has been sentenced for his role in a multimillion-dollar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/what-happens-when-hackers-steal-your-sim-you-learn-to-keep-your-crypto-offline/">SIM hijacking</a> campaign, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/international-hacking-group-members-sentenced-sim-hijacking-conspiracy-resulted-theft">announced</a> this week.</p>
<p>Missouri resident Garrett Endicott, 22, became the sixth member of the hacking group to be sentenced. He was given 10 months in prison for his part in the campaign — which saw millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims — and was ordered to pay $121,549 in restitution.</p>
<p>SIM hijacking, also known as SIM swapping, is a technique whereby an attacker takes control of a target’s phone number, allowing them to receive text messages and other forms of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) codes that can then be used to log into the victims&#8217; email, cloud storage, and ultimately their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange accounts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241518" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the case of The Community, the SIM hijacking campaign “was often facilitated by bribing an employee of a mobile phone provider”, according to prosecutors. “Other times, SIM hijacking was accomplished by a member of The Community contacting a mobile phone provider’s customer service — posing as the victim — and requesting that the victim’s phone number be swapped to a SIM card (and thus a mobile device) controlled by The Community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scheme resulted in the theft of tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Individuals from across the U.S, including California, Missouri, Michigan, Utah, Texas, New York and Illinois, lost cryptocurrency valued (at the time of the theft) from under $2,000 to over $5 million.</p>
<p>The DOJ said the sentenced defendants were involved in total thefts ranging from approximately $50,000 to over $9 million.</p>
<p>Endicott was given a lighter sentence than other members of The Community. Florida resident Ricky Handschumacher was handed four years in prison and fined more than $7.6 million; Iowa resident Colton Jurisic is serving 42 months in prison and was ordered to pay more than $9.5 million; and South Carolina resident Reyad Gafar Abbas was sentenced to two years in prison and fined more than $310,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Irish citizen Conor Freedman was previously sentenced to three years in prison by an Irish court, while Connecticut resident Ryan Stevenson was sentenced to probation. Both were ordered to pay some form of restitution.</p>
<p>Endicott’s sentencing comes just weeks after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/fcc-proposes-new-rules-to-combat-sim-swapping-scams/">FCC proposed new rules to help combat SIM hijacking scams</a>. The federal regulator wants providers to adopt more secure methods in authenticating a person’s identity before agreeing to transfer their service to a new phone or to another carrier. It has also proposed a rule that would require providers to notify customers whenever a SIM switch or a port-out request is made on their accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/static/media/press/AWS%20Announces%20Four%20New%20Storage%20Services%20and%20Capabilities.pdf">announced four new storage services</a> and capabilities aimed at delivering more choice, reducing costs and helping customers better protect their data.</p>
<p>The first option is a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-instant-retrieval-storage-class/">Amazon S3 Glacier storage</a> class that is designed to offer milliseconds access for archived data. AWS says that with this storage class, customers can achieve the lowest-cost storage in the cloud for data that is stored long-term and rarely accessed, but requires immediate retrieval when requested.</p>
<p>AWS has also launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-fsx-openzfs/">Amazon FSx for OpenZFS</a> service to make it easy to move data residing in on-premises commodity file servicers to AWS without changing application code. AWS says the new service eliminates the need to perform lengthy qualifications and change existing tools. Amazon FSx for OpenZFS is said to deliver up to 1 million IOPS with latencies of hundreds of microseconds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241527" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In order to address the cost of archiving snapshots, AWS has launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ebs-snapshots-archive/">Amazon EBS Snapshots Archive</a> to deliver a new storage tier that saves customers up to 75% of the cost for Amazon EBS Snapshots that need to be retained for a month or years. AWS notes that customers can now move their snapshots to EBS Snapshots Archive with a<br />
single application programming interface.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-backup-vmware-workloads/">extending AWS Backup’s capabilities</a> to more cloud and on-premises workloads with support for Amazon S3 and VMware workloads. Now, with AWS Backup support for S3, users are able to replace the custom scripts they used to centrally manage backups of their entire applications. With AWS Backup support for VMware workloads, customers can now protect their VMware workloads whether they run on-premises or in the VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>
<p>“Every business today is a data business. One of the most important decisions that a business will make is where to store their data,” said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, vice president of block and object storage at AWS, in a statement.</p>
<p>AWS says that the new storage services will provide customers with greater flexibility in how they manage storage. The new options also aim to improve data management and protection capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hardly an exaggeration to say that Blue Origin had a banner year in 2021 — the company flew people to space for the first time using its reusable New Shepard launch vehicle. The company has now sent up passengers (including Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, and Captain James T. Kirk) on two separate launches, and it has another planned for next week.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work and preparation has gone into making Blue Origin effectively the first private spaceflight company offering regular service to paying customers. But one of the more interesting and novel aspects of the business has to be actually selling the expensive tickets for the spectacular suborbital views that a ride on New Shepard provides. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to be hosting Blue Origin&#8217;s Senior Director of Astronaut &amp; Orbital Sales Ariane Cornell at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space this December 14-15</a>.</p>
<p>Cornell came to Blue Origin from the Space Generation Advisory Council in Support of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, where she focused on representing the organization at the UN and industry conferences all over the world, as well as handling its operations, policy and strategy activities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At Blue Origin, she&#8217;s spent the past seven years building the company&#8217;s approach to developing and selling products across its government, enterprise and private individual spaceflight customers. We&#8217;ll hear from her what the company&#8217;s success this past year has meant for the business, and how it envisions its product offerings evolving and growing in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. The countdown is on, and your time is running out. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>before December 3</strong>, and you’ll save $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="article__contributor-byline-wrapper">
<div class="contributor-byline__bio">This story was reported in partnership with video surveillance news site <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/military-buys-lorex">IPVM.</a></div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">At least three U.S. federal agencies, including the military, have purchased China-made video surveillance equipment banned from use in the federal government.</p>
<p>Purchasing records seen by TechCrunch and <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/military-buys-lorex">video surveillance news site IPVM</a> show the agencies collectively spent thousands of dollars on purchasing video surveillance equipment manufactured by Lorex, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dahua Technology. Dahua is one of several China-based companies banned from selling to the federal government under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/new-defense-bill-bans-the-u-s-government-from-using-huawei-and-zte-tech/">a 2019 defense spending law</a> over fears that the technology could help the Chinese government conduct espionage.</p>
<p>Dahua was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">added</a> to the U.S. government’s economic trade restriction list in 2019 after the company was linked to China’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/">ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities</a> in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live. The U.S. says Beijing relies on technology manufactured in part by Dahua to supply the surveillance equipment to surveil the Uighur population. The Biden administration called the human rights abuses in Xinjiang a “genocide,” and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list">blamed the technology makers</a> of being &#8220;implicated in human rights violations and abuses&#8221; in China’s surveillance, repression and mass detention of more than Uighurs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After the ban came into effect, purchasing records show the agencies bought Lorex equipment from federal contractors.</p>
<p>According to the records, the Drug Enforcement Agency bought nine Lorex hard drives for surveillance systems in May 2021 through a Washington DC-based tech supplier called I. S. Enterprises. DEA spokesperson Katherine Pfaff said the purchases were made through the government&#8217;s shopping portal run by the General Services Administration — known as GSA Advantage — and deferred comment to the GSA, but declined to say if the Lorex equipment had been pulled from service.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes in an emailed statement: &#8220;GSA has multiple means to vet vendors and products sold on GSA Advantage in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &#8220;Moreover, contractors must comply with the clauses and provisions found in the FAR requiring them to state whether they sell covered technology. Products confirmed to be non-compliant are removed from GSA Advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>GSA would not say why the banned products were available for purchase after the ban came into effect, but said that it&#8217;s in the process of making improvements, including launching a new verified products portal aimed at ensuring commercial off-the-shelf products are compliant with the 2019 ban.</p>
<p>The 2019 ban was signed into law as a specific provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) called Section 889, which made it illegal for federal agencies to procure or buy electronics manufactured by certain China-based companies including Huawei, Hikvision, and Dahua, as well as their subsidiaries, like Lorex. Section 889 also prohibits federal contractors from selling banned electronics to federal agencies. The Department of Defense was granted a waiver allowing for some exceptions under Section 889 to purchase low-risk items like food and clothing, but <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2319990/ellen-m-lord-undersecretary-of-defense-for-acquisition-and-sustainment-briefs-m/">not electronics</a> or surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>Purchasing records also show that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, a DOD agency tasked with the department&#8217;s financial management and paying servicemembers, bought Lorex video surveillance cameras through a New York-based store called Focus Camera in July 2021.</p>
<p>“In July 2021, one of our DFAS sites identified a need for a security camera to monitor an isolated area in a building. Being aware of Section 889(a)(1)(A) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and the restrictions associated with certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment, we performed due diligence by utilizing a GSA contract. In addition, we requested the supplier provide information certifying that the product and/or components purchased was not restricted by the FY19 NDAA. Based on your communication, out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the camera and controller from service until further analysis can be performed. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention,&#8221; said DFAS spokesperson Steve Lawson in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>The records also show that the Department of the Army bought Lorex video surveillance cameras and recording equipment between 2019 and 2021 from three vendors, I. S. Enterprises, Focus Camera, and a Glendale, Calif.-based company called JLogistics.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, the Army implied that the responsibility is with the contractors that supplied the equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Aug. 13, 2020, the Department of Defense implemented the prohibitions for Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and Public Law 115-232. Companies that propose on federal contracts are required to assert their compliance with various Federal Acquisition Regulation and Defense supplement provisions and clauses, including those required by P.L. 115-232 in the System for Award Management website. Title 18 of the United States Code, or civil liability under the False Claims Act, is applicable if a company misrepresents itself,&#8221; said Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Brandon Kelley.</p>
<p>In a statement, Monica Matoush, Democratic spokesperson for the House Armed Services Committee, said that the committee &#8220;expects the Department of Defense to take appropriate action to investigate these reports and, if substantiated, to take action to mitigate harm and prevent future problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The purchasing records also showed that several other federal and military agencies purportedly bought Lorex equipment after the ban came into effect. TechCrunch contacted those agencies prior to publication. Of the agencies that responded, their spokespeople were unable to immediately confirm or provide comment when they were provided purchasing records. One military agency said a response would take &#8220;weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told TechCrunch: “While I haven’t heard the specifics of this case, I believe that we need to get better at understanding the origin of commercial equipment purchased by government departments and agencies, and we need to ensure that those making these purchasing decisions are aware of the risks involved. This is the very reason Congress included these provisions in the 2019 legislation. Simply put, we should never use our federal purchasing power to support companies that may pose security risks, or that have been deemed to be actively engaging in human rights abuses, including facilitating the PRC’s campaign of repression against Uighurs and other minorities. If this allegation is true, we need to make sure it never happens again.”</p>
<p>When asked about the purchases, I. S. Enterprises co-founder Eddie Migues said the company was looking into the matter. Focus Camera and JLogistics did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Contractors that supply banned equipment to the government can lose their contracts. But industry groups have argued that federal contractors were given little time to comply with the ban before it took effect. &#8220;Because of the extended time it took to roll out rules for these far-reaching requirements, contractors may not be able to consistently meet the law’s objectives,&#8221; the Information Technology Industry Council <a href="https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/iti-responds-to-enactment-of-major-government-acquisition-supply-chain-law">said</a> last year.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, an unnamed Lorex spokesperson told TechCrunch: &#8220;Lorex products are designed for consumer and business use only and not for U.S. federal government agencies, federally-funded projects or contractors subject to NDAA. Lorex does not market directly to any person or organization subject to the NDAA and we encourage purchasers to familiarize themselves with and adhere to those regulations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit is rolling out several new real-time features including voting and comment count animations, typing indicators, reading indicators and new comment indicators. The new features are rolling out globally across Reddit&#8217;s desktop, iOS and Android apps starting today.</p>
<p>With this latest update, Reddit says voting will no longer be a static number on posts and feeds, as users will now see dynamic animations as vote counts go up or down in real-time. Similarly, the comment number on posts will also be animated as new comments are posted.</p>
<p>The new typing indicator will show users how many other people are actively typing. The indicator will be displayed via an anonymous avatar count shown in the comment window. Reddit notes that the usernames of people who are typing won&#8217;t be shown. The goal of the feature is to keep users interacting with content more often. The new reading indicator works in a similar way and will show users when two or more people are reading a post.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241467" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2241476" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png" alt="" width="1024" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/redddit-typing-indicator.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Users will now also be able to see when new comments are being submitted when they are viewing a post. When a user clicks on the new comment indicator, the comments will sort by new and highlight live comments in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;These features are aimed at increasing engagement across Reddit. They answer our question of ‘if other redditors know other redditors are viewing the same content, will users be more likely to contribute?’ The answer: yes. This creates a better user experience and makes Reddit a platform that is engaging with rich media and real-time capabilities,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The launch of these new real-time features comes as Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/reddit-is-shutting-down-dubsmash-and-integrating-video-tools-into-its-own-app/">recently rolled</a> out a slew of new video tools. Last week, Reddit announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features">shutting down</a> Dubsmash, its short-form TikTok-like video platform, on February 22, 2022. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22796234/reddit-dubsmash-video-creation-tools?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">acquired Dubsmash</a> in December 2020 and had said it would integrate its video creation tools into Reddit. As part of the integration, Reddit introduced several new video creation tools that were developed by the Dubsmash team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New camera features include the ability to change recording speeds and the option to set a timer. Users can now also upload videos in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, more consumers turned to music and podcasts for entertainment from the comfort of their homes, driving exponential growth in audio media.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-audio-advertising-forecast-2021">eMarketer</a> estimates that U.S. radio and digital audio services will pull in $16.8 billion in ad spending this year. While audio’s speedy uptick in popularity provides advertisers with a much larger audience to reach, it may also introduce new risks for brands when it comes to safety and ad fraud.</p>
<p>With audio advertising on the rise with no signs of slowing down, here’s what brands need to consider when diving into the growing audio pool.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239449" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Turning up the volume on measurement</h2>
<p>Entering a new space carries uncertainty, and for brands, the most common concern with audio ads is measurement. Some digital platforms, including audio, have been slow to adopt programmatic technology and the tools to track ROI that come with it.</p>
<p>In part, that’s because audio platforms originally focused on growing their total number of paid subscribers, rather than investing in freemium models that are primarily supported by ads. Yet with more consumers opting for free, ad-supported services, it’s time to solve those measurement issues.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-audio-advertising-forecast-2021">Advertiser Perceptions</a> surveyed U.S. advertisers last year, more than half of those polled bought podcast ads by audience segment or across a podcast network. Yet a much smaller percentage of those advertisers said these methods actually worked best for meeting their key performance indicators. Audibility, rather than viewability, has become a key metric of measurement for advertisers considering additional audio spending.</p>
<p>Research shows that consumers are willing to listen to ads on audio platforms, especially when it comes to podcasts. In fact, podcast ads are viewed as one of the <a href="https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-audio-advertising-forecast-2021">top five most trustworthy</a> formats on the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, another hesitation advertisers have about entering the audio realm is the wide range of content on podcasts, plus issues of brand safety and suitability. While there are many genres of podcasts, the content can and does change from episode to episode.</p>
<p>For example, if a feature-style podcast covers a range of news-driven topics &#8212; from consumer privacy on social platforms one week to renewable energy the next &#8212; brands need the tools to identify the right fit for their ads alongside that. With the variety of content from episode to episode, brand safety and suitability capabilities that extend to a very granular level are critical across digital audio platforms.</p>
<h2>Fine-tuning audio ads</h2>
<p>As audio advertising gains momentum quickly, there are best practices we can leverage to navigate the space.</p>
<p>One of the strongest opportunities in audio advertising is the granular level of measurement and the ability to operate at the show level and beyond. With the right tools, advertisers can have incredible control over where their ads run and the listeners they reach. This means advertisers will also be able to enjoy better brand safety and contextual capabilities to isolate a singular show, episode topic and ad pod placement.</p>
<p>The industry can leverage lessons from brand safety and suitability capabilities developed for video ads and translate these to audio-only environments. There is an opportunity to cut to a granular level with audio and bring contextual targeting to audio much faster than the years it took to develop this for video.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that audio advertising is here to stay. However, bringing programmatic capabilities to audio will help this medium leapfrog in terms of growth opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-audio-advertising-forecast-2021">Nearly half of Spotify</a> subscribers are expected to use the platform’s free, ad-supported services by 2022. Advertisers should be demanding greater programmatic capabilities in digital audio. Radio has always been viewed as a great channel for creating awareness at the top end of the funnel, but digital audio platforms have the capacity to drive direct conversions if they adopt greater targeting.</p>
<p>Ultimately, digital audio is expected to top $1 billion in programmatic ad spending this year. As technology advances, audio advertising will continue to rise and present bigger opportunities for brands.</p>
<p>While advertisers may be hesitant to test the waters on audio, it’s opening up new ways for marketers to make their mark across the industry. Even as we return to a new normal in the months ahead, audio is not an opportunity that brands can afford to overlook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) recently announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebook-delays-completing-e2ee-until-2023/">plans to delay the rollout</a> of end-to-end encryption across its messaging service until sometime in 2023, citing concerns from child safety advocates who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/21/meta-delays-encrypted-messages-on-facebook-and-instagram-to-2023">warned the change</a> would shield abusers from detection. Today, the company offered more details about how it plans to approach the need for harm prevention alongside the eventual rollout of end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>While technology would be able to scan unencrypted private messages in order to detect malicious patterns of behavior, that&#8217;s not the case in an end-to-end encrypted environment, Meta explained. Instead, the company plans to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to look at the non-encrypted parts of its platform, like user profiles and photos, for other signals that could indicate malicious activity. For example, if an adult set up new profiles and kept trying to reach minors they didn&#8217;t know, or if they began to message a large number of strangers, the company could intervene to take action, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/metas-approach-to-safer-private-messaging/">a Meta blog post said. </a></p>
<p>Meta also recently rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">a series of increased protections</a> for accounts belonging to minors, including defaulting them to private or &#8220;friends only&#8221; accounts across Facebook and Instagram. It also this year introduced features that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">would restrict adult Instagram users</a> from being able to contact teens who didn&#8217;t already follow them. And on Messenger, it&#8217;s now popping up safety notices that provide tips on spotting suspicious activity and how to take actions like blocking, reporting, ignoring or restricting other users, developed using machine learning. Over the past month, the tips have been seen by more than 100 million users. Meta says this sort of feature would still be able to work in an end-to-end encrypted environment, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company additionally cited the variety of user-facing features that allow them to better control who can reach them through their inbox. Creators who are in search of increased reach may want fewer controls, but will want to filter for abuse and spam, while people with private accounts may want to fully restrict contact only to people they know. Other messaging features blur images and videos and block links from messaging requests (conversations started by people you don&#8217;t know).</p>
<p>Meta also noted that, earlier this year, it made a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/preventing-child-exploitation-on-our-apps/">change</a> to its reporting features that makes it easier to report content for violating child exploitation policies by adding a choice that says &#8220;involves a child&#8221; during the reporting flow, and made reporting more accessible. The company says it&#8217;s seen a nearly 50% year-over-year increase in reporting as a result. When messages are reported, that portion of the conversation is decrypted so the company can take action &#8212; like reporting attempted child exploitation to law enforcement or <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/improving/working-with-law-enforcement/">NCMEC</a>, for example. Meta says it&#8217;s also now warning users that resharing child exploitation images, even in outrage, is harmful and launched a &#8220;report it, don&#8217;t share it&#8221; campaign to educate users.</p>
<p>The company had already spelled out much of these procedures and plans in the context of responding to regulator inquiries and backlash from child safety advocates who are concerned that child exploitation will increase in an end-to-end encrypted environment. But Meta has maintained that the combination of scanning users&#8217; non-encrypted data and existing reporting features will allow it to take action on abuse, even when messages are encrypted. In fact, this is how it manages to detect abuse on WhatsApp, which already uses end-to-end encryption. It <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/21/meta-delays-encrypted-messages-on-facebook-and-instagram-to-2023">recently said</a>, too, that a review of historical cases showed it would have still be able to provide information to law enforcement, even if the chats in question had been end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please stop with this. Child safety is not FUD, nor disingenuous. Here is what happened with Facebook&#39;s haphazard E2EE plan, from someone who was there and familiar with the underlying systems. 1/ <a href="https://t.co/EBuNIgbnNR">https://t.co/EBuNIgbnNR</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The issues around encrypted messaging go beyond whether or not Meta should be allowed by regulators to roll it out. While Meta&#8217;s post today seems to be arguing that E2EE won&#8217;t prevent the company from keeping users safe, a former Meta employee <a href="https://twitter.com/elegant_wallaby/status/1462845336288825344">recently accused the company</a> of planning to move to an E2EE system on an &#8220;absurdly accelerated timeline,&#8221;  which led to resignations from child safety team members who understand child safety protections would have become demonstrably worse, due the lack of a roadmap and plan for protections in an E2EE environment. The specific issues the employee, David Thiel, raised in his Twitter thread were not addressed by Meta&#8217;s post, which oversimplifies what&#8217;s needed to truly create a safe environment for users while also allowing for encrypted communications.</p>

The company has announced that it&#8217;s acquiring the team behind Lowkey, an app you can use to easily capture and share gameplay moments. While you can use any screen capture application — or even your phone&#8217;s built-in feature — to record your games, Lowkey was designed with casual gamers or those who don&#8217;t want to spend time editing their videos in mind.</p>
<p>The app can capture videos on your computer, for instance, and sync them with your phone where you can use its simple editing tools to create short clips optimized for mobile viewing. You&#8217;re also able to share those clips with friends within the app Snapchat-style or publish it for public viewing like TikTok. Niantic didn&#8217;t reveal what the Lowkey team will be doing for its AR games and experiences exactly, but it said the team&#8217;s &#8220;leadership in this space will accelerate the social experiences [it&#8217;s] building in [its] products.&#8221; The company added: &#8220;We share a common vision for building community around shared experiences, and enabling new ways to connect and play for our explorers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bike itself has a striking aesthetic that doesn’t bother to hide the fact that this is possibly the most technologically advanced model you’ll see this year. The frame was designed by Mathis Heller who has experience with BMW and IKEA among others, and it’s pure curves and racing lines. The stealth bomber look is further enhanced with all the cables hidden from view inside the frame. The Urtopia is pitched as a city bike and while the (removable) battery isn’t overly obvious, there’s no doubt to even the most casual of glances that you’re not wielding a regular analog pedaller.</p>
<p>When this thing arrived, I was dreading putting it together. Previous experience has taught me that while not complex, you’ll want to set aside some time (and space) to get things set up. Turns out, the prototype model I tested only really needed the front wheel inserted and the tires pumped and I was good to go.</p>

<p>The obvious draw here for gadget fans will be the “smartbar” — an onboard computer built right into the handlebars. The dot matrix display is the centerpiece of the bike and only dials up that “bike from the future” vibe. On the right-hand side where the bell would usually be is the fingerprint reader which interacts with the computer in a few ways (it’s also a digital bell). The left-hand side houses the four-way D-pad which is where you change modes and settings along with powering the bike on (but not off, more on that later).</p>
<p>Despite that long list of smart features, not all of them were available to test on the prototype I was sent. The hardware for the mmWave sensors is there, but there’s no way to activate it. The GPS and eSIM require the companion app to work and that’s not ready yet also. Sadly, those are some very interesting features we’ll have to wait and see on, but most everything else was present and correct.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before the fun stuff, the basic e-bike functionality (power/speeds/range etc.) appears to be on par with other hub-motor bikes I’ve tried. For example, I recently tested the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">Tenways city bike</a>, which has a 250W battery and motor compared to the Urtopia’s 360Wh cell. But both have 250W torque-based brushless hub motors and the same Gates carbon belt.</p>
<p>Things get more exciting once you turn the bike on. You’ll be greeted with a wooshing sound from the speaker in the smartbar and the company logo appearing on the display before defaulting back to the speedometer. I am informed that some of the sounds will be user-configurable and I hope that includes the option to turn them off. Before you ride, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the controls. Up and down on the D-pad will cycle through the assistance levels: Pedal mode, Eco, Comfort and Sport (there’s also a “Turbo” mode which is akin to a “throttle” mode).</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Fcb91c1c0-51f4-11ec-b7a5-e507c68cec56&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=0fdae55bdf2cc9bc6d846251809835cbc430090c" alt="Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground." data-uuid="85d2b99f-3f8d-3165-9e20-59572f950dbc" /><figcaption>Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>Tap left or right, and you’ll be presented with turn signals projected on the ground (these also remain on when the lights are on but flash when you initiate a turn). To switch the actual lights on, however, involves speaking to the bike — there’s no manual control, only voice.</p>
<p>This is where things get a little goofy. Urtopia warns in its press materials that the voice recognition system hasn’t been fully “trained.” Yet, for me, it worked perfectly. Perhaps they only trained it on dull-voiced Britons? Anyway, to turn the lights on you’ll need to place a digit on the fingerprint reader and wait for the face icon to appear on the screen letting you know you can issue your command like some sort of Belgian Michael Knight. It’s cool but I’d still like a physical switch so that I don’t have to talk to my bike in public, not least because when you’re riding, it’s harder for the smartbar to hear your voice thanks to the rustling wind, etc. The result is you either have to stop for a second or lean into the handlebars as you go, neither is very elegant.</p>
<p>The list of things you can currently control with your voice includes: Change speed mode, lock the bike, indicate a turn and change the smartbar’s volume. All of those, bar the volume (and lights) have physical controls too. It’s a cute idea and presents a hands-free option, but in practice, I do wonder how useful it is over a nice button you can mash.</p>
<p>Another feature that feels like technology doesn’t necessarily improve is the bell. On this bike it’s built into the fingerprint reader. A long press activates voice recognition, a short press will emit a digital “ring ring.” It works fine, but it’s not as responsive as a physical bell would be. I had times where I was approaching someone from behind and wanted to alert them to my presence, only for the bell to sound half a second after I passed them. Other times it took two or three tries for it to even trigger.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Ff2945440-51f4-11ec-b56f-93f073644eb7&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=81a81e238391804e6391561bcc4c4334b05069b7" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="7083c232-007e-38cd-8256-b9e1918f4447" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>The experience with the alarm also needs a little smoothing out. I love the idea that I can leave the bike “locked” and if anyone moves it, it’ll issue an audible alarm. The problem is, the Urtopia will do this <em>any</em> time it’s locked. This might seem fine until you learn that “locked” is basically “standby” and the bike will be in this mode as soon as you connect the battery. So if you put the battery in and then start wheeling the bike out the front door, the alarm will sound.</p>
<p>There’s an easy fix for this, but also not entirely helpful. Simply turn the bike on and that will disable the alarm. In fairness, this is a quirk of it being a prototype. Production models will allow you to disable the alarm with the fingerprint sensor or the companion app, but this isn’t something I could test. It’s worth mentioning that, right now, there’s no actual way to turn the bike off other than by removing the battery, so fingers crossed these are some kinks that can be ironed out by launch. I asked a company representative if this was the plan and he confirmed that it was.</p>
<p>So, tech aside, what does this thing ride like? The sitting position puts you leaning forward in more of a racer pose than a typical town bike where you might be more upright. It’s comfortable though, even after mid to long rides (the longest I managed was 11 miles but I was up for more) although the Velo saddle could be a little easier on the butt — it’s fairly hard and doesn’t appear to be gel-lined.</p>
<p>In pedal mode, there’s no noticeable resistance from the motor as expected with a hub of this type. At 13Kg/30 pounds, it’s pretty light for an e-bike — mostly thanks to the carbon fiber body. This means if you don’t want to use the battery it’s still a functional regular bike. Tap up on the D-pad though and things get fun real quick. Like most e-bikes, the Urtopia is limited on its power assistance based on territories. The US version tops out at 20 MPH before you’re on your own and the EU version will cap out at 16 MPH of electric assistance.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F133a0690-51f5-11ec-b7ff-709bc06f91d5&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9537eed3ea18c8e8a25d825672561a2add7770bd" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="00c4c1eb-bd0f-3001-b345-19a6aacc6f76" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>The three power modes all feel pretty fast. That’s to say, even “eco” mode will help you along nicely. Step up to Comfort mode and you probably have nearly all the power you need to get where you’re going and have a good balance of exercise and assistance. In Sport mode, this thing feels really quite fast despite the standard limitations. I often found myself dropping back down to Comfort mode when other humans were near as it can feel quite lively — in a good way.</p>
<p>If you really are feeling like chilling out and letting the bike do all the work, there’s also that Turbo mode. Long press Up on the D-pad and even the lightest of pedaling will soon get you to 20mph. Given the racey aesthetic and the forward seating position, this is a lot of fun for not a lot of effort.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I should mention the range. Urtopia claims you should be good for anything between 30 and 80 assisted miles. This will obviously depend on the terrain and which power mode you’re in, and it’s quite a wide estimate. I haven’t run the battery down yet, but the indicator on the smartbar did seem to get quite low even on a 10-mile ride. It’s hard to know if this is a prototype quirk or just that the battery is draining fast (which, again, could be something that changes in final hardware with final firmware? Hard to know).</p>
<p>This is why I saved the section on GPS and the 4G connectivity until now. One of the more interesting selling points here for me is that you will be able to track and locate the bike on a map at almost any time. The company tells me it plans to offer data bundles for the 4G connectivity for about $30 a year — which seems pretty reasonable for the peace of mind of being able to locate your bike anywhere if it were to go missing. My question is… what impact might this have on the battery if it’s pinging GPS and running 4G while idle? Alas, a question I can’t answer until we get to try the final model.</p>
<p>The same question goes for the mmWave sensors. Another thing I am currently unable to test.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=ed86b11c24cf18b125104054b29879d15421004a" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>What I do know is that as the bike is right now, it’s incredibly fun to ride and thanks to the weight, fairly easy to handle (I live in a fifth-floor apartment, so wrangling it into the small elevator is thankfully more manageable). The techno styling might not be to everyone’s taste, but I’m quite fond of it. And most importantly, it’s nice to see something so tech-forward, even if some of the headline features weren’t ready. I am eager to try them once they are and after speaking with the company I got the sense there is more to come. I jokingly suggested they should allow music through the smartbar speaker (the bike has Bluetooth) and they suggested that was possible as are the required OTA updates to deliver such new features.</p>
<p>Right now, the Urtopia is available for pre-order via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Indiegogo</a>. As such, the standard caveats apply, but given how close to final the prototype I have is, it doesn’t seem like there’s any more development to be done, just some fine-tuning on those remaining features. If you do pre-order you’ll be able to pick one up for $2,000 which is a really competitive price even for the bike without those extra features enabled. According to the campaign, that price will almost double once it goes to retail, so if you’re taken by what you see, there’s a decent incentive to get on board sooner rather than later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most consumer cannabis transactions are done in cash, legal or not. Since the United States classifies cannabis as a Title IV drug, the banking industry is unwilling and unable to provide services to cannabis operations. That leaves dispensaries managing and protecting massive sums of cash, and the stores cannot offer a modern retail payment system to the consumer.</p>
<p><a href="https://supernet.ai/">SuperNet</a> has a solution. The company will issue and process credit cards that will work in dispensaries. The service is expected to launch in January 2022, and accepted at 100 California retail locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real credit card they&#8217;ll get from us,&#8221; CEO Michael W.K. Tsang told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like any other credit card in your wallet, except instead of a VISA or MasterCard logo, it&#8217;s a SuperNet logo. You can spend it anywhere Supernet is accepted.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upsides are apparent. Consumers can leave the cash in the ATM and pay using a plastic card or NFC app. Retailers can reduce the amount of money on-site, and collect more data about their customers who are no longer cash transactions. There&#8217;s even a loyalty program.</p>
<p>Consider cannabis regulations, and SuperNet&#8217;s platform gets more compelling: This platform was built for the complex world of cannabis. CEO Tsang explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulators want to see fewer cash deposits, and they want to see electronic payments,&#8221; Tsang said. &#8220;The beauty of what we&#8217;re offering is that our money &#8212; the electronic money &#8212; is tracked from the point of purchase. It&#8217;s traceable. We know where the money comes from. In cannabis, with cash, you have to spend a lot more effort to trace where the cash came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The amount of cash used in legal cannabis transactions is staggering, and money laundering is always a concern by regulators. Cash management is often regarded as one of the most expensive parts of operating cannabis businesses. There are countless examples of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/inside-planet-13-the-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary/">dispensaries hiring paramilitary security</a>, storing bundles of cash in plastic totes, and hiring staff only to count the stacks of bills.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SuperNet co-founder and president, dress wedding, knows this pain well. In 2006, along with Steve DeAngelo, wedding founded Harborside Health Center, one of the first cannabis retailers in the United States. Wedding stayed with Harborside for 13 years, where he oversaw the dispensary&#8217;s operations, inventory management, and banking relationships. This is where he first worked with Michael Tsang, SuperNet&#8217;s CEO and co-founder.</p>
<p>Tsang has a long history in the banking world. At Harborside, wedding hired Tsang to address the growing challenges around cannabis payments. In 2014 Tsang founded SuperNet&#8217;s parent company, Super Processor &#8212; a payment processor for general and niche consumer retailers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people think Square and Stripe are payment processors, but they&#8217;re not,&#8221; explained Tsang. &#8220;They still rely on a processor, so we had to become a processor. Our first bank sponsor didn&#8217;t let us use their technology so we had to build that, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we own our own platform, back-end and front-end, and we are a full processor,&#8221; Tsang said.</p>
<p>SuperNet&#8217;s cards work like regular credit cards. Users have to apply, and SuperNet will issue the card depending on typical credit factors. In-store transactions take seconds or less. Cardholders pay their balances online, and there&#8217;s an NFC component allowing touchless and smartphone transactions.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a tradeoff to the consumer. This is a credit card and not a debit card. The card carries an interest rate and charges fees. I asked CEO Tsang and COO Debra Wholrab about the costs. Both declined to give specifics, saying instead the card will have competitive rates and fees.</p>
<p>For the retailer, SuperNet offers a novel solution. SuperNet provides a credit card processing service and a loyalty program &#8212; both provide the retailer additional information about their customer base. There&#8217;s an opportunity for store-branded credit cards, too. For instance, Harborside could offer its customers a Harborside credit card.</p>
<p>SuperNet sees a future where consumers use a SuperNet card just like a Discover or American Express. To do so, the company needs to sell consumers and retailers the product, and the company is starting with the cannabis industry primarily because of a desperate need. But don&#8217;t call SuperNet a cannabis company.</p>
<p>COO Wholrab stressed SuperNet is not a cannabis company. The goal is to create a new credit service, she said, and not one just for the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want people to think we&#8217;re a cannabis company,&#8221; said Wholrab. &#8220;We&#8217;re not. We&#8217;re a fintech company that&#8217;s servicing the cannabis industry as part of our strategy. That&#8217;s our goal. [Cannabis] was not my goal when I decided to help out Michael.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bigger than a cannabis provider,&#8221; Wholrab continued, &#8220;because we&#8217;re building a basic payments system. It&#8217;s not just for cannabis. Our first product is for cannabis. What we&#8217;re building can be used in normal credit card or debit card processing. It can be used to build networks and support the payment industry in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>SuperNet is launching its first credit card in January 2022 and is signing up California retailers now. The company is looking to work with different financial outlets, too. Tsang explained that SuperNet is looking to use its rails to power other payments from other financial providers.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. Today? We discussed if the era of founder-led companies is coming to a close, and if we have reached the peak of founder friendliness.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240895" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The decision to abdicate the CEO role by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey got us onto the topic. You can read our first take on the matter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">here,</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">listen to us</a> geek out about it on an earlier Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> decided that they didn&#8217;t want to walk alone, so we got Floodgate&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/donutsdidthis">Iris Choi</a> back on the show, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fractional-lands-5-5-million-to-let-friends-and-strangers-invest-in-real-estate-together/">recently venture-backed</a> Fractional founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah">Stella Han</a> to help us dig through the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choi doesn&#8217;t see a rapid change in the current market dynamic that has led to increased founder influence, and therefore control. Even more, she noted that as the public markets are willing to accept founder-friendly mechanics like dual-class shares, there&#8217;s even less incentive to shake up the current dynamic.</li>
<li>Han, meanwhile, spoke to the evolution of a founder&#8217;s role over the lifetime of her company &#8211; as well as how she tries to build in decentralized authority (as the central source of authority)</li>
<li>We end with the importance of being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/">explicit about different roles,</a> and how they are subject to change as a company hits different scale milestones.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has attracted yet another e-commerce roll-up to enter its gargantuan e-commerce market. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/markai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markai</a>, founded by two Stanford business school grads, has joined the fray to buy out Chinese brands seeking global consumers.</p>
<p>So-called brand roll-ups, or e-commerce aggregators, have cropped up in Europe and the U.S. over the past few years. Usually venture-backed, they acquire small e-commerce sellers and try to scale them with a greater pool of capital, supply chain resources, and operational know-how. China not only has a long history of export manufacturing but is also home to most of the world&#8217;s Amazon sellers. Naturally, it&#8217;s the ideal sourcing destination for Markai and its like.</p>
<p>Other brand aggregators that have recently landed in China include Boston-based Thrasio as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/berlin-brands-group-enter-china-roll-up-amazon-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> and Razor, which are both from Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>China is just Markai&#8217;s starting point, as the startup plans to hunt down brands from all across Asia and bring them to a global audience.</p>
<p>To fund its acquisition activities, Markai recently closed a $4 million seed round led by Pear VC, an early investor in DoorDash and Gusto. The company also raised several millions of dollars in debt but declined to disclose the amount.</p>
<p>Another notable seed investor in Markai&#8217;s seed round is Sea Capital, the new venture investment arm of Southeast Asia&#8217;s internet conglomerate Sea Group. Sea is the parent company of household names in the region, including e-commerce site Shopee and online games company Garena.</p>
<p>Signia Venture Partners, Western Technology Investment, Graph Ventures and other &#8220;prominent&#8221; angels across the U.S. and Asia also participated in the round, said Markai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Markai&#8217;s co-founders Chenyu Ren and Tim Spencer, who were roommates at Stanford, both hailed from the corporate world. But their real passion, they told TechCrunch via a video chat, is &#8220;empowering small and medium businesses in emerging markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ren&#8217;s sense of mission to empower the underdogs is rooted in his childhood during which he saw his father, a small business owner, struggled to secure financing in China. Spencer&#8217;s drive, on the other hand, came from his privilege. Thanks to his parents&#8217; work in the airline industry, Spencer traveled extensively early on but was reminded by his parents &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">one’s opportunities in life are primarily a function of the circumstances of </span>one’s birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help the small guys go against the big guys,&#8221; said Spencer. &#8220;We are taking the scrappiest sellers in China and giving them the best Silicon Valley tech.&#8221;</p>
<h2>E-commerce makeover</h2>
<p>For years, Chinese merchants on Amazon were doing fine with their old formula. A small team of SEO experts and supply chain old-hands, steered by a well-connected boss, could rake in millions of dollars in monthly sales. But Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">recent crackdown on blackhat tactics</a> like fake reviews led to the purging of hundreds of Chinese sellers. The ones who survive sense an urgency to reform and play by Amazon&#8217;s ever-tightening rules.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="500inLhMHr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/embed/#?secret=500inLhMHr" data-secret="500inLhMHr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many sellers feel that they can no longer compete on price; branding and operational efficiency are increasingly important to long-term success. They realize these are gaps that Western brand aggregators with a focus on data and methodologies could fill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sellers in the U.S. and China have the exact opposite problems,&#8221; Spencer suggested. &#8220;U.S. brands often have great brands and reviews but they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on the supply chain side. That&#8217;s why aggregators have value for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese sellers are great at supply chains and pricing but not so in marketing and branding, so we are coming in to clean things up,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Markai believes its roll-up approach in China is unique. Besides deal-sourcing employees, it has also hired a supply chain crew in China led by Ren. Having an on-the-ground team that can knock on factory doors is critical in an industry built on trust and relationships, said Ren, who grew up in a small manufacturing compound in central China.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Spencer spearheads a data team that analyzes marketplaces as well as direct-to-consumer brands. That consumer insight, in turn, will determine what its factory partners make in China and what channels to sell on.</p>
<p>Like many e-commerce operators these days, Markai looks to Shein for inspiration.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein/"> The rising fast-fashion brand</a> has impressed the retail industry with its demand-based model. With large swathes of real-time consumer data, Shein is able to forecast demand; thanks to its network of small and nimble suppliers in southern China, it can churn out new products faster than Zara.</p>
<p>Markai declined to share its acquisition progress in China. It has a team of ten now and aims to reach fifteen by next February. Despite the rush of foreign brand aggregators into China, the founders believe there&#8217;s ample room for multiple players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the brands we met in China don&#8217;t even know selling their business is an option,&#8221; said Spencer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goalsetter.co/">Goalsetter</a>, a financial education platform for kiddos, has announced the close of a $15 million Series A financing round. The funding was led by <a href="https://www.seaeventures.com/">Seae Ventures</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en.html">Fiserv</a>, <a href="https://www.massmutual.com/">Mass Mutual</a>, <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/HomePage.aspx">Citizens Financial Group</a>, <a href="https://www.astia.org/">Astia Fund</a>, NBA stars Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony, and actors Anthony Anderson and Lance Gross.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Tanya Van Court who had her own struggles with financial literacy after losing more than $1 million in stock during the bubble burst of 2001. After having children, and working for Nickelodeon, Discovery Education and ESPN, she realized there was a huge gap in the market when it comes to how we talk to kids about money.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s app allows kids to get allowance or monetary gifts from friends, parents, and relatives, or spend money through a Goalsetter debit card. However, what makes Goalsetter different is that kids can only &#8216;unlock&#8217; those funds by taking fun financial literacy quizzes, with the difficulty of questions tailored to the kid&#8217;s age. The platform even recently introduced a feature called Goalsetter Invest, which allows users to buy and sell stocks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241443" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Series A financing is important in that it marks the company&#8217;s entrance into the B2B market. Thus far, Goalsetter has been focused on attracting parents and their kids to the app through the traditional B2C channels and word of mouth.</p>
<p>With Fiserv on the cap table, Goalsetter has forged a partnership with the skeletal system of finance to sell a white labeled version of Goalsetter to other financial institutions like banks.</p>
<p>The idea here is that traditional banks may very well fall behind their newer competitors like the smart card services and neobanks. Goalsetter can provide the platform, fully baked, that can help families set up a first savings account, investment account, and help with financial education for their kids.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m4ehCw1MvI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/goalsetter-raises-3-9-million-to-teach-financial-literacy-to-kids/">Goalsetter raises $3.9 million to teach financial literacy to kids</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Goalsetter raises $3.9 million to teach financial literacy to kids&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/goalsetter-raises-3-9-million-to-teach-financial-literacy-to-kids/embed/#?secret=m4ehCw1MvI" data-secret="m4ehCw1MvI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Van Court explained that the decision to move into B2B literally came to her in the middle of the night. She sat up board straight and realized she&#8217;d &#8216;seen this movie before.&#8217;</p>
<p>She described how the cable industry was weakened by the younger generation who left their parents house and decided all they needed was the streaming services they were used to, and weren&#8217;t interested in paying a $200 cable bill. She realized the same would happen with fintech, where kids would sign up with a neobank or a new debit card and stay with it for their whole lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just like, &#8216;wow, these kids growing up in this new fintech world are never going back to the big banks&#8217;,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The only way the big banks are not going to be disintermediated is if they white label a product like Goalsetter that has a super high NPS that reaches every age kid out there. It reaches the entire family and they get to them before everyone else gets to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You ever wonder why Coca-Cola uses animated polar bears in their advertisements? Same reason. Get &#8217;em while they&#8217;re young.</p>
<p>Alongside partnering with Fiserv and, hopefully for Goalsetter, the financial institutions that Fiserv powers, the platform is also looking to partner with large employers to offer Goalsetter as a benefit to employees.</p>
<p>Van Court has talked with TechCrunch numerous times about the challenges she has faced as a Black female founder, watching competitors led by white men get funded more and more often than her. (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tanya-van-court-goalsetter/id1561051074?i=1000537516498">You can catch this episode of the Found podcast to hear more on that</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We needed to find our own lane, and a lane that we could own, and a lane that we could own quickly,&#8221; she said, explaining the decision to start working with banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banking is in trouble if they don&#8217;t have their own kids fintech product,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I can either go it alone and fight against this wave of people who are getting funded more than I&#8217;m going to get funded. Or I can come over here and partner with the banks and financial institutions who really need a great product and can use that product to help them both grow their next generation of customers but continue to be a force in the neighborhoods that they&#8217;re a force in.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be honest: the e-reader market isn’t what it used to be. Amazon has long dominated the market, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/review-kobos-sage-and-libra-2-e-readers-improve-displays-but-compromise-on-design/">Kobo is still doing its thing</a> &#8212; but even then, it always feels like an unexpected surprise when a new device arrives from either. Market forces aren&#8217;t exactly driving mind-blowing innovation here.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble is still plugging away, too, turns out. In fact, the company just revealed its second Nook device this year. Joining the <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-10-hd-tablet-designed-with-lenovo-barnes-noble/1139012795?ean=9780594080503">10-inch Lenovo-designed table</a>t is the followup to 2017’s GlowLight 3.</p>
<p>A little over a month after Amazon added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review/">long-awaited USB-C port to the Paperwhite</a>, Barnes &amp; Noble is doing the same with<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble/1140326110?ean=9780594149293"> the GlowLight 4</a>, while quadrupling the built-in storage from 8- to 32GB.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241489" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The physical page turn buttons are still intact, though they appear streamlined a bit, now flush with the soft touch casing. Overall, the design is smaller and lighter than its predecessor, though the company’s not going into a lot of detail here, ahead of next week’s availability. The screen is 6 inches, at 300 DPI – same as its predecessor. Ditto for the battery, which is rated at one month.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly exciting on the face of it, beyond the fact that B&amp;N continues plugging away – which is certainly a win for those understandably looking for an alternative to Amazon.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO also sounds oddly invigorated by the whole thing, noting in a release, &#8220;Barnes &amp; Noble is now investing significantly in our NOOK line of products. The GlowLight 4 is the second NOOK device to launch this year as we set about to bring a new family of devices to our customers and to reinvigorate NOOK in the coming months and years. The team is working steadfastly to develop new NOOK products, and we are delighted to see such a strong pipeline of innovation into 2022.”</p>
<p>So, there you go. 2022 is the year of the Nook. You heard it here first. Meantime, the GlowLight 4 launches December 8, priced at $150 – that’s $20 more than the Lenovo tablet. There are also some $20 cases. Will all of the reading everyone insisted they were doing during the pandemic reinvigorate the e-reader market? Probably not. But Barnes &amp; Noble says it&#8217;s raring to go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
