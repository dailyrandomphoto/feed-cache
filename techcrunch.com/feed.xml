										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K’s Labour Party has confirmed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattack/">cyberattack</a> on a third-party company has led to the compromise of members&#8217; data.</p>
<p>In an email sent to all party members and <a href="https://labour.org.uk/about-your-data/">posted to its website</a>, Labour said it was informed of a &#8220;cyber incident” by an unnamed third-party data processor on October 29.</p>
<p>Details remain thin, but Labour said the incident led to “a significant quantity of party data being rendered inaccessible on their systems.” A person responding to the incident told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/labour-party-supporters-details-affected-by-cyber-security-breach-12458935">Sky News</a> that the incident was a ransomware attack on Labour&#8217;s third-party supplier. Labour has yet to confirm this, and TechCrunch has asked for more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229077" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The scale of the breach is also unclear and it’s not yet known what data has been compromised. Labour, which holds financial information on paying members, said that the affected data “includes information provided to the party by its members, registered and affiliated supporters, and other individuals who have provided their information.”</p>
<p>However, it appears a number of former and non-members were also impacted by the incident. One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/PoppyCocktails/status/1456218546682449924">claims</a> they received the data breach notification despite having left the party in 2009, while others <a href="https://twitter.com/buddy_hell/status/1456217907940118529">said</a> they also received the email despite having never been a party member. Some say they are affected by the data breach, even though they aren&#8217;t Labour Party members, but paid the political fee as a member of a Labour-affiliated union.</p>
<p>Labour has about 430,000 members. The party&#8217;s statement said its investigation is underway. It&#8217;s also informed the National Crime Agency (NCA), the National Cyber Security Centre, and has informed the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the NCA said: “The NCA is leading the criminal investigation into a cyber incident impacting on the Labour Party. We are working closely with partners to mitigate any potential risk and assess the nature of this incident.” The ICO — <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/11/uk-political-parties-must-improve-data-protection-practices/">which recently urged U.K. political parties to improve data protection practices</a> — has also confirmed that it is actively making inquiries into the incident.</p>
<p>The Labour Party said it was also working closely with the unnamed third-party supplier to &#8220;urgently investigate&#8221; the full nature, circumstance and impact of the incident. It stressed that its own data systems were unaffected in the attack.</p>
<p>The incident isn&#8217;t the first time that the Labour Party has been impacted by ransomware. Last year the party alerted members that data stored by company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/blackbaud/">Blackbaud</a> had been compromised in a ransomware attack. At the time, the party said it believed that the information pertaining information about donors over a period of several years had been compromised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I mentioned last week, I’ve been thinking a lot about agtech. It’s honestly unavoidable when you spend as much time as I have lately digging into the world of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">vertical farming</a>. As I learned pretty quickly, things balloon outward into the many facets of the food supply chain. All of the pieces are inexorably linked, and food is so completely foundational to virtually every aspect of life.</p>
<p>This was one of those weeks with a flurry of robotics news, and food was a constant theme through much of it. What strikes me about it is something that’s been apparent for anyone who has followed the space with any frequency &#8212; robots and automation have the potential to profoundly impact every stage of the process. That includes everything from how food is grown to how we consume it.</p>
<p>The latest news demonstrates some key steps in that cycle. Obviously there are a lot of points in between worth highlighting, but just drawing on the headlines that have popped up since the last one of these columns, we can start building a pretty convincing skeletal structure here.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>I actually touched on Iron Ox in last week’s column as an example of a company producing robotics for the explicit purpose of indoor farming. I guess I jumped the gun a bit, as it has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/iron-ox-launches-a-new-robot-for-moving-and-monitoring-indoor-crops/">highlighted a new robotic system</a> designed specifically for that purpose. As I noted previously, Iron Ox isn’t a vertical farming company; rather, it functions closer to a traditional indoor/farm greenhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227841" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227841" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2227841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Iron-Ox-Grover-Three-Quarter-View.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227841" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Iron OX</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What sets it apart from those older models, however, is the way in which robotics and technology serve as its backbone. Nowhere is that clearer than with Grover, a mobile robotic system designed to move grow trays for monitoring and eventual harvesting. Says CEO Brandon Alexander:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are applying technology to minimize the amount of land, water and energy needed to nourish a growing population. Our short-term goal is to mitigate the impact of climate change on the agriculture system. And we won’t stop until we achieve our long-term mission of making the produce sector carbon negative.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2226641" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226641" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2226641" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Flippy-2-Dispensing-and-Placing-Fries-17s.2021-10-29-17_34_41.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226641" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Miso Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Miso Robotics also announced a new robot this week &#8212; or, rather, an update to its old model. The company has been piloting Flippy in select White Castles for a bit now, and just announced a version 2.0 of the fast food robot based on kitchen staff feedback. Unsurprisingly, workers&#8217; biggest request was that Miso make the hamburger-flipping robotic arm more capable. Here’s Miso’s CEO Mike Bell:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like all technologies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/flippy-the-hamburger-cooking-robogets-a-more-capable-successor/">Flippy 2</a> has evolved significantly from its predecessor, and we are extremely grateful for the insights collected from White Castle to truly push its development forward in a real restaurant environment. Flippy 2 takes up less space in the kitchen and increases production exponentially with its new basket filling, emptying and returning capabilities. Since Flippy’s inception, our goal has always been to provide a customizable solution that can function harmoniously with any kitchen and without disruption.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2195465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2195465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg" alt="Nuro-Las Vegas fundraising round" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Autonomous mid- and last-mile robotics have been waiting in the wings to disrupt food delivery for some time now. In recent years, Nuro has shot to the top of that list, courtesy of partnerships with big names in food and grocery delivery like Domino’s, Kroger and Walmart. The money hasn’t hurt either.</p>
<p>Nuro this week announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">a fresh $600 million raise,</a> bringing the Mountain View-based firm’s funding north of $2 billion, while giving it an $8.6 billion valuation. The latter represents a 72% increase over this time last year. The Series D was led by Tiger Global Management. Co-founder and president Dave Ferguson told TechCrunch, “With the boost of this new funding, we’re turning our focus to commercializing and scaling the production of our third-generation vehicle at our new facility in Southern Nevada.”</p>
<p>That manufacturing plant is set to be completed at some point next year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227879" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227879" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2227879" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paexo-Back-by-Ottobock-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227879" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ottobock</p></div></p>
<p>They’ll no doubt want to look into robotic exoskeletons to help ease the strain of human employees. Big news in that world, as German medical device maker Ottobock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ottobock-set-to-acquire-fellow-robotic-exoskeleton-maker-suitx/">announced plans to acquire SuitX</a>. The UC Berkeley spinout was founded by mechanical engineering professor Homayoon Kazerooni, who also founded Ekso Bionics.</p>
<p>Like Ekso (and, for that matter, many in the space), SuitX’s exoskeletons serve dual functions: work assistance and medical. The walking assistant Phoenix suit plays well into Ottobock’s current offering. SuitX has also been piloting Boost Knee, a robotic knee brace. Says Kazerooni:</p>
<blockquote><p>This step is a success not only for SuitX but also for the University of California, Berkeley, where entrepreneurial endeavors are fostered to their greatest extent for the good of humans worldwide. I’m looking forward to bringing our technologies to communities internationally with Ottobock for better quality of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Buried in the veritable metaverse of Meta news this past week was this announcement from Facebook AI Research and CMU, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/facebook-researchers-build-better-skin-and-fingertips-for-softer-more-sensitive-robots/">which have been working on a robotic skin</a>. A strange fit for Facebook to be certain, though who knows, a tacticity sensing synthetic skin could one day play a role in the aforementioned metaverse. For now, however, it’s an interesting look into how roboticists might expand the sensing capability of machines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226412" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226412" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2226412" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png" alt="" width="802" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png 802w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roboat-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://roboat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roboat <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>This MIT CSAIL project seems to go beyond interesting experiments. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mit-csail/">Roboats</a> are self-driving water taxis that the department has already begun to deploy in Amsterdam canals. Here’s CSAIL head Daniela Rus on the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>We now have higher precision and robustness in the perception, navigation and control systems, including new functions, such as close proximity approach mode for latching capabilities, and improved dynamic positioning, so the boat can navigate real-world waters. Roboat’s control system is adaptive to the number of people in the boat.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://upwest.vc/">UpWest</a>, the venture firm led by Shuly Galili, Gil Ben-Artzy and Assaf Warhaft, announced this morning that it has closed on a $70 million fund, the fourth in the firm&#8217;s 10+ year history.</p>
<p>The firm is unique in that it specializes in funding and supporting Israeli founders who are looking to enter the U.S. market early in their startup&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The earliest funds for the firm were sub-$10 million, but returned and then some for LPs thanks to investments in startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sentinelone/">SentinelOne</a>, which recently went public at a valuation north of $10 billion. Some other standout portfolio companies for UpWest include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/honeybook-doubles-valuation-with-new-round-as-it-helps-independent-workers-get-paid/">Honeybook (valued over $2 billion after its recent raise)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/stampli/">Stampli</a>, Imbuit, and CyCognito.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the firm has matured, and seen success with its portfolio, it has become more able to be aggressive within the ecosystem. UpWest can now lead pre-seed and seed rounds, and has already taken point on four seed rounds for stealthy companies, using capital from its new fund.</p>
<p>Though UpWest is sector agnostic, it has developed expertise in areas where Israeli tech is strongest, such as cybersecurity, AI, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and fintech.</p>
<p>Galili told TechCrunch that there is opportunity in spaces like modernization of data, particularly in industries like the supply chain and health care.</p>
<p>Alongside the news of its next fund, UpWest is also announcing that it has opened an office in Tel Aviv. Galili explained that this structures the firm to be more similar to many of its portfolio companies, who have an HQ in the U.S. but run an engineering team based in Israel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Israel continues to be a bellwether for new innovation, new technologies, and it&#8217;s a maturing ecosystem, to the point where you have now so many unicorns and so much money flowing to the late stage,&#8221; said Galili. &#8220;We&#8217;re also seeing a lot of new players coming into Israel and billions of dollars have been poured into kind of betting on the fast horses there. The current seed stage, however, I would say is still an area where we feel — because we&#8217;ve had 10 years of really specializing in that category and building the right infrastructure and the right relationships with others — we feel we have incredible opportunity to continue to be active.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://whylabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhyLabs</a>, a machine learning startup that was spun out of the Allen Institute last year, helps data teams monitor the health of their AI models and the data pipelines that fuel them. Last year, the startup raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/whylabs-brings-more-transparancy-to-ml-ops/">$4 million seed round</a> and today, the team announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A round co-led by <a href="https://defy.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Defy Partners</a> and Andrew Ng&#8217;s <a href="https://aifund.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Fund</a>. Existing investors Madrona Venture Group and Bezos Expeditions also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, &#8220;MLOps&#8221; wasn&#8217;t really a thing, but it&#8217;s now an established category and we&#8217;re now seeing a growing number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/iterative-raises-20m-for-its-mlops-platform/">startups</a> and established players who are trying to get an early foothold in this market.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s top of mind for everyone,&#8221; WhyLabs CEO Alessya Visnjic said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really experienced a real phase shift in the last year. Today, the post-deployment maintenance of machine learning models, I think, is a bigger challenge than the actual building and deployment of models. That is what&#8217;s powering this whole MLOps shift and organizations are sharply focused on creating culture, processes and the toolchains around operating machine learning models.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228850" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228879" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228879" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228879" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg 1359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whylabs_diagram.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228879" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhyLabs</p></div></p>
<p>As Visnjic noted, every company that builds AI models also struggles with transparency and observability of how they operate in production. It&#8217;s one thing to train a model but it&#8217;s a completely different challenge to ensure that the model continues to perform as expected and that the data that powers it remains trustworthy. Most of the time, models will continue to provide (wrong) predictions, after all, even if the input data is corrupted, maybe because an API changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;ML engineers need better tools to ensure high-quality data through all stages of an ML project’s life cycle,&#8221; said Ng. &#8220;AI Fund is excited to support WhyLabs, whose open source logging library and AI observability platform makes it easy for developers to maintain real time logs and monitor ML deployments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year, WhyLabs has made it easier for data teams to use its service, in large part because it launched its SaaS platform with a free self-serve tier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsDsLEpigBw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our SAS work has focused on removing the configuration burden, making sure that you can just enable monitoring similarly to how you would enable monitoring of a particular compute instance,&#8221; Visnjic said. &#8220;Because we&#8217;re a SaaS, we focused on privacy a lot. It&#8217;s very critical to be privacy focused because we monitor both data health and model health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, that means WhyLabs never moves data around. As Visnjic explained, the service only captures the statistical fingerprints that describe the data and models. Figuring out how to monitor the highly proprietary data of its potential customers was one of the first challenges the team tackled after WhyLabs launched. It&#8217;s not just about moving data around inside a company&#8217;s data estate, after all, but also ensuring that permissions inside a company are managed well to ensure sensitive information won&#8217;t leak.<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png" alt="" width="1024" height="725" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png 1119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ai_observatory_debugging.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhyLabs&#8221;SaaS is not just about making sure that anybody can log it,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;It&#8217;s about making sure that people can use this platform and privacy-centric way and they can plug it into any kind of machine learning stack that they&#8217;re using.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do that, the team also spent the last year building out its integrations with all of the major cloud platforms, machine learning frameworks and data services like Kafka, Spark and Ray.</p>
<p>With the launch of the SaaS platform only two weeks ago, WhyLabs COO and co-founder Maria Karaivanova noted, the number of models the service is monitoring already tripled.</p>
<p>The WhyLabs team plans to use the new funding to build out its engineering and go-to-market teams. On the engineering side, that also means adding improved support for streaming data and real-time AI applications. As Visnjic noted, the company&#8217;s go-to-market approach will include a focus on educating customers about MLOps, so the company is also building out an evangelism team.</p>
<p>&#8220;WhyLabs is in a unique position to transform how AI is governed and MLOps is managed by any enterprise with the rapid adoption of its observability platform and data logging library,&#8221; said Neil Sequeira, founder and partner at Defy Partners who has now joined the WhyLabs board of directors. &#8220;They have built what is effectively a control center for operating AI applications. In turn, their technology has a meaningful positive impact on intelligent application builders and the hundreds of millions of people touched by AI every day.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passage of the so-called &#8220;anti-Google law</a>&#8221; in South Korea, Google has announced it will comply with the new mandate by giving Android app developers on Google Play the ability to offer alternative payment systems alongside Google&#8217;s own. The legislation represents the first time a government has been able to force app stores to open up to third-party payment systems for in-app purchases &#8212; a change that could impact both app stores&#8217; revenues, as developers look to skirt the tech giants&#8217; commissions.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">a blog post</a>, Google says developers in South Korea will be able to add an alternative in-app billing system in addition to Google Play&#8217;s billing system for their mobile and tablet users in the country. At checkout, users will be able to choose which billing system they want to use for their purchase.</p>
<p>The company warned that alternative billing systems will &#8220;not offer the same protections&#8221; or features of Google&#8217;s own, including things like parental controls, family payment methods, built-in subscription management, support for Google Play gift cards, and support for Google Play&#8217;s rewards program called Play Points. It noted also that 1.5 million South Korean users this year used Play Store gift cards and more than 12 million enrolled in Play Points.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229037" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google then reiterated the reasons why it believes it has the right to charge a commission on in-app purchases, saying that the revenue helps the company fund and develop Android, the Play Store, developer tools, and more.</p>
<p>Details for developers about how to implement the third-party billing systems will be provided in the weeks ahead, Google said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229071" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229071" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?w=498" alt="" width="498" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=220,300 220w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=768,1048 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=498,680 498w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=1125,1536 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The passage of the South Korean law comes at a time when governments around the world are investigating Apple and Google for antitrust practices and are weighing the idea of new regulations over their respective digital payment systems. In the U.S., Fortnite maker Epic Games is also suing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-files-a-counterclaim-in-epic-games-lawsuit-saying-its-owed-financial-relief/">both</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">companies</a> for the rights to offer its own in-app billing system, claiming Apple and Google are operating as monopolies. Epic&#8217;s case with Apple is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"> now under appeal,</a> as the original ruling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">declared</a> Apple was not a monopolist, but said Apple had to change its App Store policies to allow links to other payment systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In South Korea, however, the matter was not left to business lawsuits, but rather the National Assembly. The governing body voted on Wednesday, August 25, 2021, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">proceed</a> with the revised Telecommunication Business Act, which opens up the app stores.</p>
<p>Like Google, Apple had also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">argued</a> that such a law would make it more difficult to protect consumers from fraud and protect their privacy. In the days that followed South Korea&#8217;s decision, Apple<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/"> updated its App Store Guidelines,</a> but only to comply with the decision of a class action settlement with a group of U.S. app developers who wanted the ability to contact their customers outside the App Store to inform them about other payment options. In a few days time, Apple will <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/11/02/court-hearing-apples-motion-to-delay-app-store-change-ruling-on-nov-9">attend a hearing</a> related to the Epic Games lawsuit to see it can hold off on allowing links to alternative payment mechanisms until the results of its appeal are in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple has not yet made changes to comply with South Korea&#8217;s law, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">but said</a> its current policies are in compliance.</p>
<p>In recent months, both tech giants have been working to head off forthcoming regulations by lowering their app store commissions. Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">just last month dropped its commissions</a> to 15% on subscription apps and as low as 10% for media apps. Apple has not yet made such a move. However, Apple and Google had made previous changes to lower commissions for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">smaller</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">businesses</a>, and Apple this summer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">carved out a new lower commission structure</a> for news publishers who participate in Apple News.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kintaba.com/">Kintaba</a>, a startup from a couple of Facebook site reliability veterans, is building a product to monitor incident response across the entire lifecycle. Today the company released a new concept called heat maps, a way to look at a response from a human perspective and build an understanding of how people in your organization respond when a crisis happens.</p>
<p>Kintaba co-founder and CEO John Egan says the company&#8217;s founders cut their teeth at Facebook and they wanted to create a product for organizations of all sizes that brings a positive focus to incident response through data. He says that the new heat maps give management inside a company a view of the people responding to the incidents, so they can understand who is most involved, something that&#8217;s been difficult to ascertain to this point using traditional incident response tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a higher level view into reporting on the entire management suite. So rather than looking at something like [what happened] in the moment, [it&#8217;s about having] a retrospective over time,&#8221; Egan explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229032" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229043" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229043" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2229043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?w=680" alt="Kintaba human-centric heat maps show people involved in incident responses inside a company." width="680" height="431" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg 2262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=768,487 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=1536,974 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=2048,1298 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Centric-Heatmaps.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kintaba</p></div></p>
<p>He believes that by looking at these heat maps, you can start to understand trends such as when incidents are happening, and perhaps more importantly, who the people are who are being impacted by those incidents. &#8220;It&#8217;s just an additional layer of information on the incident that I think was kind of missing before,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He hopes this data is used for positive purposes to help improve processes over time and to reward people who are going out of their way to report and respond to incidents and to reduce the impact of them on the company and customers. He sees this as a natural evolution of incident response, one that looks at the human and cultural side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cultural challenges are really people&#8217;s challenges and you want that data as you move more towards a company-wide [incident response] implementation. And I think that&#8217;s really the direction this is going, [and this] is much more interesting [than traditional metrics]. I think the space is continuing to evolve into companies practicing incident response management in a [more] healthy manner,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kintaba launched last year and so far has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/kintaba-incident-alerts/">raised $2.25 million</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the cryptocurrency space the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-chair-gensler-calls-congress-help-rein-crypto-wild-west-2021-08-03/"> “Wild West.”</a> Meanwhile, in China, the government created its own digital currency while abruptly canceling the IPO of its most well-known fintech firm, AliPay, for regulatory reasons. It’s enough to give the casual observer whiplash. What is happening here?</p>
<p>With all the focus on the great technology race between the U.S. and China, little attention has been paid to an area with enormous implications: Who will lead the innovation and, therefore, control the technology behind international payments systems?</p>
<p>This race matters for two reasons.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First, Western countries’ leadership in international payments allows them to enforce sanctions against bad actors like Iran and North Korea. If Chinese solutions gain the dominant foothold in the developing world, this will become much harder.<br />

<p>Second, if the West leads in fintech, it can set reasonable world standards for this new field, such as protecting the environment, preventing illicit cross-border transactions and safeguarding consumer privacy. Reasonable and clear regulation is exactly what responsible U.S. companies — who don’t want to operate in a “Wild West” environment — have been asking for but not receiving.</p>
<p>In the meantime, China has taken the global lead in mobile payments, both in sophistication and scale. Ant Financial, AliPay, WeChat Pay and others comprise the world’s most advanced mobile payments market. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/ant-alibaba-1-3-billion-users/">Alipay has over 1.3 billion users</a> and more <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1140297/china-annual-active-users-of-alipay/">customers outside of China</a> than all of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218493/paypals-total-active-registered-accounts-from-2010/">PayPal’s user base.</a> In aggregate, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1060702/china-mobile-payment-transaction-value/#:~:text=China'%20mobile%20payment%20industry%20is,payment%20transactions%20in%20the%20country.">$45 trillion in mobile transactions</a> volume that Chinese merchants process annually is twice as large as what <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/market-share-statistics/">MasterCard,</a> Visa and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277841/paypals-total-payment-volume/">PayPal</a> process each year combined.</p>
<p>In addition to these Chinese private sector innovations, the Chinese government has also developed the world’s most advanced central bank digital coin and has completed over 70 million transactions — totaling over $5 billion in revenue — since it was launched <a href="https://time.com/6084146/china-digital-rmb-currency/">earlier this year.</a> The digital yuan is a centralized currency supported by the full faith and credit of the Chinese government, versus traditional cryptocurrency, which is speculative. While the stated goal of the digital yuan is financial inclusion to help those Chinese without bank accounts, the currency’s centralized nature allows the Chinese government to monitor every transaction and restrict access if the Chinese citizen has a low score on the country’s <a href="https://time.com/6084146/china-digital-rmb-currency/">social credit system.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If these Chinese leapfrog technologies gain an international following, they could make it very difficult for the West to enforce sanctions on bad actors, as former Treasury official Justin Muzinich and <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/americas-crypto-currency-conundrum">others have pointed out.</a> Currently, the United States and its allies enforce international sanctions on Iran and North Korea, for example, by preventing Western companies from doing business there and halting banks from facilitating payments to these countries through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system and <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/c/correspondent-bank/">correspondent banking relationships</a>.</p>
<p>Responsible fintech companies in the U.S. (including those that service crypto), also <a href="https://ripple.com/compliance/">fully comply</a> with “know your customer” and anti-sanction regulations. Due to the size and scope of the American financial system, this has been an effective <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/americas-crypto-currency-conundrum?utm_medium=promo_email&amp;utm_source=lo_flows&amp;utm_campaign=registered_user_welcome&amp;utm_term=email_1&amp;utm_content=20211029">deterrent to illicit behavior.</a></p>
<p>With the advance of the digital yuan and Chinese payments platforms, companies wouldn’t need U.S. or other Western banks to facilitate these payments and so sanctions would become very difficult to enforce and illegal payments by terrorists and criminals easy to hide. A combination of AliPay, other advanced payments platforms and the Chinese digital yuan could begin to <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-05-20/could-chinas-digital-currency-unseat-dollar">circumvent this system.</a> Sigal Mandelker and others have pointed out that due to the onerous regulations Western governments have asked banks to follow to create “correspondent banking relationships,” <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf">75% of big U.S. and European banks are reducing</a> the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf">number of these relationships.</a> This erodes America’s ability to influence international banks and crack down on illegal behavior.</p>
<p>Beyond sanctions, Western governments have other reasons to shape the rules of the new digital financial system. Current banking practices have many safeguards in place to protect against abuse. The West can only set similar standards for these technologies if we are in the lead. For example, the West will want to prevent criminals and terrorists from transferring money anonymously through cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg31576/html/CHRG-115hhrg31576.htm">Bitcoin and others</a>. Western governments should also set up safeguards that protect small-time investors from getting scammed, such as what happened when the Ethereum network fueled the initial coin <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/initial-coin-offering-explained-ethereum-ico#section-initial-coin-offerings-on-ethereum">offering trend in 2017-2018. </a></p>
<p>Finally, environmental regulations are needed. Digital currencies based on “proof of work (PoW),” such as Bitcoin, use an enormous amount of computing power which requires electricity and thus, creates massive carbon emissions. Mining Bitcoin, for example, which still uses the PoW model, uses about as much electricity per year as the entire country of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/10/bitcoin-rise-could-leave-carbon-footprint-size-london">Norway</a>. In fact, multiple reports have explained that <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-rattles-bitcoin-but-it-may-just-be-green-marketing-51620934886">Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion</a> in bitcoin may have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a9bd5b42-272e-465c-9284-9fe2a7906f48">erased a significant portion</a> of the carbon emissions gained from that year’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/18/a-new-report-highlights-the-incredibly-high-environmental-cost-of-teslas-bitcoin-investment/#:~:text=Obviously%2C%20Bitcoin%20isn't%20a,Tesla%2C%20it's%20clearly%20an%20investment.&amp;text=So%20of%20the%20roughly%2015,.%2C%20or%200.24%20million%20Mt.">sales of electric vehicles.</a></p>
<p>These issues must be considered thoughtfully. But speed is of the essence. China understands the power in being the leading mover in key technologies and actively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/11/chinas-next-plan-to-dominate-international-tech-standards/">seeks to create world standards</a>. For example, China has already contributed digital currency ideas to create global standards that would govern how data is transferred between financial institutions, such as for payments, credit cards and <a href="https://time.com/6084146/china-digital-rmb-currency/">securities trading.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the U.S. is falling behind since its own regulation of this space is a mess. An alphabet soup of regulatory agencies such as the CFTC, SEC and others have struggled to wrap their heads around regulating blockchain, cryptocurrencies and other fintech innovations.</p>
<p>The SEC has sued, or threatened to sue, two of the most responsible and innovative companies in the space — <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-secs-attack-on-crypto-in-the-united-states">Ripple</a> (on whose board one of us serves) — which along with some other responsible actors, have been asking for reasonable regulation for years. At the same time, the SEC seemingly, but not explicitly, gave the all-clear to Bitcoin and Ethereum in spite of the problems outlined earlier. Many other fintech companies in the international payments space and blockchain/cryptocurrencies are in “regulatory purgatory,” not knowing when or how <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-policy/sec-commissioners-clash-on-cryptocurrency-securities-debate/30927.article">the axe will fall. </a></p>
<p>Let’s be clear: The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">“Wild West”</a> Gensler was referring to is not in anyone’s interest. Fintech, especially international payments enabled through blockchain, can be enormously positive. They make remittance payments much faster, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/americas-crypto-currency-conundrum">cheaper</a>, and more accurate; help the <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf">1.7 billion in the world who are unbanked</a> obtain greater access to finance; and have myriad other benefits. However, an alphabet soup of conflicting regulators and ill-defined arbitrary rules only benefit those who would like to supplant the American financial system. By coordinating across agencies and setting a few clear, reasonable rules, the federal government can enable the next generation of fintech entrepreneurs and keep the U.S. in the lead in this critical area.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since it was founded in 2012, <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a> has signed up some of the biggest banks in the country — including the likes of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank — as well as a bevy of smaller, more traditional financial institutions across the U.S..</p>
<p>Now, it’s setting its sights on the startup and fintech market, hoping to power the lending and banking services of some smaller, but fast-growing digital lenders.</p>
<p>Blend, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/">went public just a few months ago</a>, started off selling software designed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/blend-100-million/">simplify and digitize the mortgage lending process</a> for both borrowers and lenders.</p>
<p>But as time passed, the company has expanded its product set in two important ways: First, it has gone deeper into the broader homeownership journey, offering up ways for applicants to find homeowners insurance, title insurance, and even be matched up with a real estate agent as part of its mortgage application flow.</p>
<p>The second big expansion comes from a <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/">new suite of services</a> that moves it beyond mortgage by offering deposit accounts, credit cards, and support for other lending products like personal, home equity, and auto loans. By doing so, the company seeks to provide a single platform for its customers, according to Blend founder Nima Ghamsari.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the DNA for how those products work is the same, but typically at these institutions, these product lines have completely disparate and siloed organizational structures, as well as technology stacks,&#8221; Ghamsari said. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done the last four years is take our platform and make it a single place for a consumer to work with a financial institution across all these products. So you could show up and get four or five products on Blend now that you couldn&#8217;t historically get within one system.&#8221;</p>
<p>By reusing a lot of the same components necessary for mortgage origination, including know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) verifications, as well as identity, income and employment verification, the Blend consumer banking suite can speed up the onboarding and application process for banking, credit card, and loan products. It also rolled out a &#8220;Blend Builder&#8221; tool that lets customers customize the components they wish to use with a drag-and-drop interface.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">iRocket, a reusable rocket startup based in New York, has landed its first commercial customer. The company said Thursday it had signed a multi-launch agreement with <a href="https://turionspace.com/">Turion Space</a>, a recent Y Combinator grad that&#8217;s developing spacecraft for orbital debris removal and satellite servicing.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, <a href="http://irocketusa.com/">iRocket</a> will send twenty of Turion’s forthcoming Droid satellites to orbit across ten launches.</p>
<p>iRocket is developing fully reusable rockets, starting with its Shockwave launch vehicles, which it says will be ready to go to orbit in two years’ time. The autonomous 3-D printed Shockwave will be capable of supporting payloads with a maximum size of around 300 kg (661 lbs.) and 1,500 kg (around 3,300 lbs.) The company has begun testing its hardware, including injector testing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/irocket-to-begin-rocket-engine-testing-at-nasas-marshall-space-flight-center/">rocket engine testing</a>, at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. Next up is a full assembly test, CEO Asad Malik told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re definitely on track, and our partnership with Turion just strengthens that,” he said.</p>
<p>Both companies have their eye on space junk removal; iRocket, with its resuable upper stage and Turion, with the Droid spacecraft, which the company says will remove orbital debris by docking with it and dragging it to an orbit low enough that it can eventually be captured and burned up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Turion, which was part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort, aims to launch the first Droid prototype in October 2022. The startup already has a separate launch agreement in place for that mission, though the startup couldn’t specify which provider it had selected. Turion has received funding from the U.S. Space Force, the M&amp;J Engineering Group, and VC firm Village Global.</p>
<p>For that initial launch, the spacecraft will not be capable of removing orbital debris or servicing satellites. “We will only be doing domain awareness activities,” Turion CEO Ryan Westerdahl explained. “What we&#8217;re calling this satellite is ‘Just Get It Up There,’ because we want to get something into orbit as soon as possible, because a large part of what we need to do is really build out our ground operations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to YC, Turion has received funding from Soma Capital, Forward VC, Pi Campus, FoundersX Ventures, Harvard Management Company, and Imagination VC.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is building a sustainable future in low Earth orbit and active debris removal is a huge part of that,” Westerdahl said.</p>
<p>The two companies also hinted at possible future collaborations on in-orbit servicing. Westerdahl suggested that Turion could work with iRocket to perform final in-orbit deliveries for a fraction of the launch company’s payload, combined with space junk removal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data streams with continual, real-time updates of information are a critical building block of how apps and sites function today, and now a startup that has built a platform to power those data streams is announcing a growth round of funding on the back of strong growth in its business into a wider set of use cases. <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PubNub</a>, which provides APIs to power messaging and data updates for apps and other digital businesses, has picked up $65 million, a Series E that the San Francisco-based startup will be using to continue expanding the functionality on its platform, as well as for geographical expansion: first up will be a new Asia Pacific office in Singapore.</p>
<p>PubNub tells me that its messaging, presence, and other data-based APIs today are used across some 600 million devices in more than 70 countries, with some 900,000 developer projects generating some 21 petabytes of data on a monthly basis. Its &#8220;thousands&#8221; of customers include the likes of Adobe, Atlassian, DocuSign and RingCentral. More widely, verticals where it is seeing strong traction include gaming, virtual events, enterprise collaboration, chat, rideshare/delivery services, telehealth applications, connected fitness, and smart home products &#8212; a range of areas that rely on the concept of &#8220;virtual spaces&#8221; where regularly updated streams of data &#8212; be it the progress of a delivery, or how many steps you&#8217;ve taken, how much energy you&#8217;ve used, or who is participating or chatting in an online meeting &#8212; are a core part of the user experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing an explosion in what customers are doing using PubNub,&#8221; PubNub&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Todd Greene said in an interview. &#8220;From the time we started PubNub the vision was what software is needed to power virtual spaces. At first it was messaging, but over time we saw from customers that communication wasn’t enough.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Raine Group with others including Sapphire Ventures, Scale Ventures, HPE, and Bosch also participating. PubNub is not disclosing its valuation, but for some context, it has raised more than $130 million, and it was <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/53999-11/company/profile#deal-history/118101-16T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated by PitchBook</a> to be valued at around $220 million in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/pubnub-nabs-23m-as-its-iaas-network-hits-1-3t-messages-sent-each-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last equity round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>I have confirmed with Greene that the San Francisco-based startup&#8217;s valuation now is &#8220;much higher&#8221; than that, although it&#8217;s hard to quantify PubNub&#8217;s growth since it has not disclosed how much data it has worked with on a monthly basis, just the number of messages &#8212; 1.3 trillion messages in 2019 &#8212; a figure it&#8217;s not updating this time around. It says that customer bookings have grown 200% year-over-year in 2021.</p>
<p>PubNub works very much behind the scenes &#8212; you will never see a &#8220;powered by PubNub&#8221; message come across your screen when its APIs are being used &#8212; but it is also working in what has become a central and critical part of how all digital services operate.</p>
<p>More and more aspects of our day-to-day lives are carried out, or dependent in some way, on digital experiences, and part of the reason why is because those digital experiences themselves have come a long way. Apps, sites and connected devices have more functionality, more data, and better user experience built into them than ever before, and so we use (and rely) on them more as a result. Unsurprisingly, those providing the infrastructure to make all that work as it should are seeing a boost of business growth and investor interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Added to all that, the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; has definitely picked up some hype as a concept in recent times, which might also give a push to companies that talk about powering virtual spaces as PubNub does, although the bigger picture is a little less buzzy and just how these services have evolved and operate already.</p>
<p>PubNub is not the only one seeing its star rise in that context. Others like Twilio, SendBird, MessageBird and Sinch also are providing API-based messaging and other communications services used by third-party apps, sites and other digital businesses. More directly competitive with PubNub are others providing API-based routes to build any kind of data updates, messaging or otherwise, that turn the wheels of any real-time services. They include <a href="https://ably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ably</a> out of London, Techstars-incubated <a href="https://www.cometchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cometchat</a>, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>Within that wider context, PubNub&#8217;s selling points have been its geographical reach with global points of presence, making it compliant with a variety of regional data protection rules including HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 Type 2; and the fact that it is adding more functionality, both natively and by way of integrations with other services, all of which it lets developers control and monitor by way of a centralized dashboard. Services that it currently covers include in-app chat, geolocation, virtual events, push notifications and IoT services.</p>
<p>One might think that the current shift in digital culture towards less, not more, notifications overall might prove to be a challenging climate for the likes of PubNub. After all, information overload is not really a contested topic anymore, nor is the concept of apps draining your data or monitoring you all the time whether or not you are using them, even if how best to handle these issues, and whether the overall effects are bad or good, still may be. But Greene says that is not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even back when we just did messaging, with the push notification feature, 99% of the messages were in-app. If you are ordering a car and watching it move on the screen, it’s effectively many messages [data pushes] coming to show you that. Companies like Apple and Google aren’t blocking that, so the shift with notifications hasn’t effected us at all,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;It has impacted in a positive way. In the past apps may have provided pushes to let you know something has happened. Now, they are not watching that anymore [by default] so now focusing on the in-app experience is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lead investor Raine Group is an interesting backer for the startup as it continues to grow. The company is not just a <a href="https://raine.com/investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prolific investor</a> &#8212; but also counts a very extensive list of customers among those it <a href="https://raine.com/investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advises</a>, where it has been involved in a ton of M&amp;A deals involving companies like Apple, Tencent, ByteDance, Warner Music, SoftBank, Uber and more. This opens the door for PubNub to leverage that network for business development and to make more customer inroads.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be partnering with PubNub, powering the future of real-time digital and social experiences in a world where constraints on developer time and engineering resources are placing an increasing demand for software solutions and APIs,” said, Christopher Donini, MD of The Raine Group, in a statement. “PubNub’s leading solution provides easy-to-implement reliability, security, and low-latency, which we believe solves a pervasive problem at the intersection of Raine’s global network across technology, media, and telecommunications.” Donini and managing partner Kevin Linker are joining PubNub’s board of directors with this round.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fountain’s technology whittles down the median days to hire to 8.70 from the industry average of 36 days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may have visited some quick-service restaurants or other retailers in the past few months and noticed signs posted with shortened hours or not being open on a certain day.</p>
<p>Dubbed “The Great Resignation,” the mass exodus of hourly workers over the past 18 months has now resulted in a competition for talent. So much so that companies like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/28/1049980529/starbucks-and-costco-raising-wages-in-the-nationwide-competition-for-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco are raising their minimum wage</a> to $17 per hour, while Starbucks said it is going up to $23 per hour.</p>
<p>“The world of hourly workers has never seen a more challenging environment like the one we are in now,” <a href="https://get.fountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fountain</a> CEO Sean Behr told TechCrunch. “There was some hope amongst our prospective and current customers that once COVID-19 was over, whenever that was, that hiring would just become easy again. That is completely wrong.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What’s made it so difficult? Well, aside from the pay, Behr explained a few trends that are happening. The first is that gone are the days of someone applying to a job in person: today, 80% of people apply via a mobile device, making it easier to apply for multiple jobs at the same time. Second, there are many more options for hourly workers than fast-food and retail: people can drive for ride-sharing or food delivery or work at the new Amazon warehouse a few miles away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this together has created a competitive environment for hourly workers, many of whom have recognized that “earning $8 an hour to make burritos is not attractive anymore, nor is earning $13 an hour to risk their health,” he added.</p>
<p>Behr admits there is “no one silver solution,” which has resulted in this challenging situation that includes a majority of companies getting fewer candidates applying for jobs this year versus last year.</p>
<p>That’s where Fountain comes in. The remote-first company provides an applicant tracking system aimed at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2019/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82 million people considered hourly workers in the U.S.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228627" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228627" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png" alt="Fountain" width="1024" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png 10140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=1536,832 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=2048,1109 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fountain-Product-Screen.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228627" class="wp-caption-text">Fountain dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fountain</p></div></p>
<p>This kind of high-volume hiring is defined as needing to fill over 1,000 positions, or receiving that many applications per position, in a short period of time. Fountain’s technology also whittles down the median days to hire to 8.70 from the industry average of 36 days, Behr said.</p>
<p>Working with over 250 customers like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Liveops, Fountain has processed more than 16 million applicants in the past 12 months and helped customers hire more than 2 million so far in 2021.</p>
<p>That translated into revenue growth of 220% year over year in 2021 &#8212; and attention from some new investors, including SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, which led Fountain’s new $85 million Series C round. For this round, the company received seven competitive offers from investors, but felt bringing SoftBank on was the “right partner for us as we look to expand globally,” Behr said.</p>
<p>Andrew Zloto, director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that what SoftBank liked about Fountain was catering to the needs of the modern workforce by helping employers find the right candidates quicker, and at the same time, helping employees find the job they want equally as quickly.</p>
<p>“Sourcing and hiring hourly workers have been transformed by the rise of the gig economy, which has shortened the process of hiring and onboarding from weeks to a few days,” Zloto added. “Fountain has built an essential toolkit for companies to keep up with and compete in this new hiring environment by simplifying, optimizing and automating the candidate journey to decrease time-to-hire. We believe the company’s partnerships with large employers like Chipotle and Liveops is a stamp of credibility of their innovative platform and ability to execute.”</p>

<p>Participation in the investment also came from new investors B Capital Group and Mirae Investment, and existing investors DCM, Origin Ventures, Commerce Ventures, Semper Virens and Uncork Capital. The latest funding round gives Fountain total investments to date of $119 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/fountain-a-platform-for-recruiting-gig-and-hourly-workers-raises-23m/">$23 million Series B</a> raised in 2019.</p>
<p>Behr intends to deploy the new funds into hiring — the company currently has seven salespeople globally and would like to also grow in engineering and marketing. Fountain also has plans for a big investment in the international market. It is already doing business in 77 countries, and Behr would like to do a push into Asia, Europe and the U.K.</p>
<p>Fountain is the latest company receiving investment for hourly worker tools. For example, Workstream recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">$48 million in Series B</a> funding for its text-based recruitment approach. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/">Bite Ninja</a> secured some pre-seed funding to continue developing its software that enables workers to pick up drive-thru shifts from home.</p>
<p>Behr says many of Fountain’s competitors are more focused on vertical niches like restaurants or truck drivers, and that its differentiation is that it takes a more holistic approach by matching the job characteristics to those looking for work.</p>
<p>“Rather than a complex one-sized-fits-all approach that airs on the side of the knowledge worker, we have pushed the industry to see that it doesn&#8217;t work for hourly workers,” he added. “We help you find who you are looking for — that person who is fine working in a cold warehouse or on that early morning shift.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Products developed to manage artificial intelligence data are still largely fragmented, solving one problem at a time for developers, but not the entire life cycle.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.samasource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sama</a>, a company providing high-quality training data that powers AI technology applications. CEO Wendy Gonzalez said the company is developing the first end-to-end AI tool for training data through machine learning.</p>
<p>To do this, the company secured an oversubscribed $70 million in Series B financing led by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), with participation from First Ascent Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Vistara Growth and all existing investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228870" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The new capital infusion comes two years after the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/samasource-raises-14-8m-for-global-ai-data-biz-driven-from-africa/">$14.8 million in a Series A round</a>. At that time, Sama’s thesis was around developing high-accuracy training data and had built tools where annotations could occur, Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>The team then looked into how to inject machine learning into that process while still maintaining high accuracy. They believed it came down to humans in the loop and developed one-click to human-in-the-loop validation with their Sama Machine Learning Assisted Annotation MicroModels that also launched Thursday.</p>
<p>“What we continued to learn is that data was required at every stage of the AI lifecycle, but everything was fragmented,” she added. “You were having to transform the data eight or nine times with different partners.”</p>
<p>Going after the Series B was purposeful. Sama aimed to develop an end-to-end platform that would be a frictionless way to get data, have it annotated with high accuracy and be able to then put that data into a model. All of that required funds, Gonzalez said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samasource raises $14.8M for global AI data biz driven from Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/samasource-raises-14-8m-for-global-ai-data-biz-driven-from-africa/embed/#?secret=lTIa6Jh0Z7" data-secret="lTIa6Jh0Z7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Sama team got to know CDPQ through its Montreal network and felt a connection to the private equity firm’s mission and ESG mandate, which resonated with its own mission.</p>
<p>For example, Gonzalez noted that Sama is the only certified B Corp in the AI infrastructure space and had a mission to move people out of poverty. It has already helped 56,000 people, hiring people from East Africa as expert labelers, 50% of those women.</p>
<p>“They cared about the problem we were solving with AI and cared about how we were doing it,” she added. “Infrastructure data is what is going to power everything in AI, so there is a tremendous opportunity for growth. Beyond that, we want to form a social mission to be the largest, if not one of the largest, B corporations powering the most innovative technology. It would also be amazing to change the way corporations think about social good, too, because diverse businesses are better businesses. It’s a lofty goal.”</p>
<p>Wils Theagene, senior director of CDPQ in Quebec, said the company is the second-largest pension fund in Canada, with CA$390 billion in assets under management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm’s $250 million Equity 253 fund was inspired by the death of George Floyd in 2020, and encourages companies to use diversity as a growth vector, he said. Investment companies have five years to reach 25% diversity on their boards, management team and equity ownership.</p>
<p>Just as Sama was attracted to CDPQ’s ESG mission, Theagene said the firm liked Sama’s focus on progress, performance and social mission.</p>
<p>He noted that “the management team is one of the best we came across and were impressed with Wendy.” When the Sama team was explaining its performance and the industry, CDPQ felt their model for economic development in countries in need of support was the right one: instead of providing financial aid, giving people jobs to help them take ownership of their future, Theagene added.</p>
<p>“We believe Sama is the market leader in AI and will be the company leading the market in the future,” he said. “Their new micromodels allow them to attack AI data in an efficient manner, and its end-to-end platform is meeting the requirements companies have around data for AI applications.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sama is working with companies like Google, Walmart and Nvidia and plans to continue managing its growth. Since joining the company six years ago, Gonzalez said Sama has experienced monthly recurring revenue growth of 13 times.</p>
<p>The next steps are all about accelerating coverage of the AI data pipeline, launching in new markets, like Europe and eventually Asia Pacific, and building out operations.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of AI data, Gonzalez sees top of mind being to reduce bias so there is more representative data.</p>
<p>“Similar to the European Union and ethics in AI, it would not surprise me if the U.S. goes the route of GDPR with guidelines for data protection so that people are designing in AI with transparency and purpose,” she added. “We want to have a platform built by a diverse population where then we can be diverse in what data is collected and in who is labeling it.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s been 12 years since the animals of Zynga’s FarmVille first grazed the screens of fans worldwide.</p>
<p>When it launched in 2009, the strategy simulation game was the <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742341043601408?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major game</a> on Facebook to ping friends in the News feed. This drew players back into the game and formed an addictive loop that quickly turned the simple act of tending crops into an obsession for fans, including <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/2010-05-10-farmville-mila-kunis-is-obsessed-with-farmville.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125381106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians</a>. By the end of its first week, FarmVille had reached <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742341836374016?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one million daily active users</a>, according to Zynga founder Mark Pincus. From there the game went viral and became such a huge part of the cultural zeitgeist that at the height of its popularity in 2011, Zynga had over 300 million users and was generating nearly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/14/facebook-punks-partners-again-how-publishers-can-fight-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fifth</a> of Facebook’s revenue.</p>
<p>But in 2012, as mobile became the dominant platform for casual gaming, Zynga struggled to pivot. It wasn’t until 2014 that Zynga launched its mobile game, <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville-2-country-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 2: Country Escape</a>, a side quest followed up by <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville-tropic-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 2: Tropic Escape</a> two years later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It would take the arrival of new leadership in 2016, led by CEO Frank Gibeau, to make the farm franchise come alive for a new generation of players. Late 2016, Gibeau opened Zynga’s Helsinki Studios near mobile giant Supercell, maker of the hit strategy game Clash of Clans and farming simulation Hay Day. Then in 2018, Zynga recruited Nordic games veteran Sonja Ängeslevä from Unity Technologies to head the development of FarmVille 3.</p>
<p>Although the original FarmVille shut down late last year when Adobe ended support for Flash, the franchise still has a massive following, according to Zynga’s president of publishing Bernard Kim, with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005037/en/Zynga-Opens-Pre-Registration-for-FarmVille-3-Ahead-of-November-4-2021-Launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 700 million</a> installs to date, more than a fifth of the four billion downloads of Zynga’s entire game portfolio.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Ängeslevä about why she believes FarmVille 3 will have global appeal, and Pincus on what it means to see the farm world he created over a decade ago brought back to life.</p>
<h2>All about animals</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2228861" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228861" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2228861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="263" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=768,674 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=680,597 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228861" class="wp-caption-text">FarmVille 3 head dev Sonja Angesleva. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zynga</p></div></p>
<p>After years of seeking fan feedback, Ängeslevä found the most desired feature players wanted were animals to nurture. So <a href="https://youtu.be/KELeZObZy6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 3: Animals</a> was created to serve as a collectible Tamagotchi game of sorts. Launching with 150 exotic breeds, like Golden Pheasants, Palm Cocktaoos and Silver Arabian Horses, players will have a chance to care for their newborns and raise them to maturity while earning rewards for good parenting. Animals in the flock will serve a purpose, like laying eggs or providing wool, but some of the animals in the game will become loyal companions like pets.</p>
<p>“Although the core gameplay is still the planting and harvesting of crops, the animals add a depth of layers to farm building activities that bring a richness to the world,” said Ängeslevä.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The secret to the game’s success will lie in its ability to surprise and delight players through continuous live updates of content. Minigames like pig races and hot air balloon rides will be offered, as well as guest appearances by animal influencers, said Ängeslevä, giving a nod to the meme Grumpy Cat as an example.</p>
<p>And there will be cat and dog farmhands that can assist with tasks like picking flowers and digging holes. “The coolest thing is that farmhands can interact with items in the game, like jumping into a chair or swinging on the swing set,” she said. “There are also weather events that provide dynamic gameplay, like rain and snow, that affect crop yields. The game has been designed so that players never run out of things to do.”</p>
<p>As one of Zynga’s Forever Franchises, FarmVille 3 is expected to monetize with ads and in-app purchases, with the goal of generating $100 million in annual revenue over the next five years, Ängeslevä said.</p>
<h2>FarmVille as metaverse</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1025986" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1025986" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1025986" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg?w=257" alt="" width="257" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg 533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=257,300 257w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1025986" class="wp-caption-text">Zynga founder Mark Pincus. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zynga</p></div></p>
<p>“I’m just happy to have FarmVille out there for players to enjoy again,” Zynga founder and chair Mark Pincus told TechCrunch. “It’s been such a long journey to get it on mobile. We originally showed FarmVille <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/farmville-iphone/">onstage with Steve Jobs</a> for the iPhone 4 launch in 2010, and it was so difficult to get it to synchronize with the web game because of Flash. We always wanted to launch a next generation of FarmVille, but needed it to be a next-level experience, not just an add on.”</p>
<p>As for FarmVille evolving into a virtual world like Roblox, where bands like Third Eye Blind can play at the country fair, Pincus said, “From the very first time I thought of FarmVille, I thought that could be the beginning of the metaverse where you could start with a square plot of dirt and build that into a persistent connected world. That was my original vision for Zynga and social gaming, so I’ll leave that possibility open.”</p>
<p>FarmVille 3 is available to play cross-platform on mobile <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/farmville-3-animals/id843506607" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.farmville3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> and desktop <a href="https://farmville3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac M1</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Chu to discuss govtech, why cities must be proactive about new forms of mobility, and how the private and public sectors can come together to create a comprehensive mobility system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiffany Chu, SVP of Via and co-founder and former CEO of Remix, had been working in user experience design at ZipCar when, in 2014, she decided to take a year off for a fellowship at Code for America. With her background in architecture and urban planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chu had always been fascinated by the way transportation acts the lifeblood for built environments as a whole.</p>
<p>It was at this gathering of tech-minded individuals looking for ways to bring government into the digital age that Chu met her future Remix co-founders. Chu and her team built a simple grassroots transit planning prototype that helped suggest better routes to San Franciscans. An urban planning blog featured the project and it went as viral as a mapping and routing tool for public transit could.</p>
<p>Soon, Chu and her team were fielding requests from transit agencies that had ideas on how to make the tool even better, and unexpectedly, Remix was formed. The following year, Remix joined Y Combinator, raised a $2 million seed round and brought the Oregon Department of Transportation on board as its first customer. In the years that followed, Remix kept gaining momentum, and a total of $27 million in funding, until it garnered the attention of Via, an on-demand shuttle service.</p>
<p>Via acquired Remix in March for $100 million, which enabled the company to provide Remix&#8217;s suite of planning tools to city and transit agency partners and expand its role in the mobility ecosystem.</p>
<p>Today, the reach of the original Remix platform is extended even further as part of Via’s over 500 partnerships across five continents.</p>
<p>We sat down with Chu to discuss the proliferation of govtech, why cities need to be proactive about new forms of mobility, and how the private and public sectors can come together to create a comprehensive mobility system.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Remix started at a hackathon at Code for America, and then you went on to Y Combinator. How important were these institutions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tiffany Chu:</strong> Code for America was super important for us, because it brought together a bunch of like-minded, civic-oriented people who basically raised their hands and said they’d take a pay cut from their typical mid-career tech jobs to pursue public service for a year.</p>
<p>When we decided to do Y Combinator, that was really important to us, because none of us, with the exception of Dan Getelmen, my CTO, had co-founded a company before. So we didn&#8217;t know the first thing about running a business, much less running an enterprise, government-focused, B2G business. YC really gave us the business fluency and literacy we needed and connected us to other founders in highly regulated industries like healthcare and edtech that had to go face similar hurdles. I think we may have been the first ever govtech or civictech company that YC invested in.</p>
<p><strong>Govtech and civictech are not something you see a lot of in Silicon Valley. What do you wish the startup world knew about this kind of tech and the applications it can be used for?</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s special about this space is that it&#8217;s the intersection of a customer base that will always be around. Governments rarely go out of business, so there&#8217;s a very direct, targeted customer base that makes it clear who your product needs to serve.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aimed at construction sites, vacation homes or for other hard-to-reach locations, <a href="https://www.arlo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo</a>&#8216;s new Arlo Go 2 LTE/Wi-Fi Security Camera is at your beck and call to keep an eye out for thieves, sneaks and other scoundrels.</p>
<p>The company is also peddling its <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo Secure</a> subscription service, which gives users access to a rolling 30-day library of cloud recordings, in addition to computer vision analysis of the footage with personalized person, animal, vehicle and package detection. The service also includes an Emergency Response feature, which can dispatch emergency services to the camera&#8217;s location at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>The cameras are rugged, with a weather-resistant design to withstand the test of the elements, provide secure local storage to microSD cards and have connectivity built in. The cameras can phone home to the company&#8217;s servers using your Wi-Fi connection if and when it&#8217;s available, or LTE networks as either a primary or fallback option when the Wi-Fi goes down for the seventh time just when the latest episode of your favorite TV show gets good.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Arlo Go 2 builds on the success of its Arlo Go predecessor, serving as the most versatile solution for anyone seeking wire-free security for hard-to-access locations,&#8221; said Tejas Shah, senior vice president of Product and Chief Information Officer at Arlo. &#8220;Arlo Go 2’s ability to operate on either a mobile network or Wi-Fi puts the power in the hands of the user, allowing them to select the best connection for their use case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arlo Go 2 is equipped with GPS positioning so you can keep tabs on them &#8212; making it easy to locate multiple devices across a larger area, or to go find your camera if bitter irony should strike and the thieves leave your house alone and instead just wander off with the cameras themselves. The cameras also feature two-way comms with speakers and a microphone so you can troll your would-be burglars from a safe distance, and a built-in siren so you can signal to your intruders that they&#8217;re being watched.</p>
<p>Carrying a $250 price tag, the cameras will be available through Verizon now-ish, with additional carriers becoming available next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company captures real-time customer behavior so companies can see who is genuine, and who is fraudulent, and identify the root cause of customer friction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Much of our days are built around digital experiences, and companies are increasingly looking for ways to unlock conversion and optimize fraud screening. Today, a startup that has built a real-time behavioral analytics tool is announcing funding as it sees demand for its services increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neuro-id.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuro-ID</a>, an analytics platform capturing real-time customer behavior at scale for digital organizations so that they can see and understand the intent of their digital customer and identify the root cause of customer friction, secured $35 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The new capital follows $7 million Series A funding raised in December 2020, bringing the company’s total funding to $49.5 million since being founded in 2014.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canapi Ventures led the latest round, and was joined by existing investors Fin VC and TTV Capital, which both led the Series A.</p>
<p>Neuro-ID is not disclosing its valuation, but CEO Jack Alton said, via email, it is on the back of “strong customer traction.”</p>
<p>“Neuro-ID is on track to grow three to four times in both revenue and customer base in 2021,” he added. “This follows a huge year of expansion for us, during which we also saw three to four times in client and revenue growth as well as a 500% increase in monitored customer journeys.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228829" style="width: 1181px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228829" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2228829 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png" alt="Neuro-ID" width="1171" height="1063" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228829" class="wp-caption-text">Neuro-ID&#8217;s human analytics dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Neuro-ID</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s list of customers includes Intuit, Square, Affirm, OppFi and Elephant Insurance, which are using Neuro-ID proprietary Human Analytics software that translates all of the swipes and taps of user behavior into actionable insights.</p>
<p>The behavioral analytics also enables customers to see and use behavioral data to optimize existing AI/ML models. Customers, on average, have been able to increase conversion by 200% and reduce historical fraud rates by 35%, the company said.</p>
<p>Alton intends to use the new funding to hire additional engineering talent, accelerate product-led growth and expand globally. In the past year, the company nearly tripled its employee base, which now stands at 60, he said.</p>
<p>Walker Forehand, partner at Canapi Ventures, said via email that he considers Neuro-ID to be a one-stop shop for identifying user intent and experience analytics that is differentiating itself from competitors with its unique ability to analyze first-time customers versus others that focus on repeat customer interactions, he added.</p>
<p>Delivering seamless customer journeys is a priority for both fintechs and banks, where Forehand said just less than 10% of people complete a digital journey after starting one. Traditional models are also using physical attributes for verification, like address and date of birth, whereas Neuro-ID uses other methods to identify whether a customer is genuine or fraudulent.</p>
<p>“This new view of customer behavior at scale opens up the ability to improve conversion to drive more revenue by fast-tracking good customers, become more sophisticated at measuring intent, and improve the design quality of their digital products, all while reducing fraud,” Forehand said. “What’s most exciting is that Neuro-ID’s technology is not only applicable to fintechs and banks, any industry that addresses high-volume digital and automated decisions could become a customer of Neuro-ID.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> officially spun out its infrastructure services into a new business called <a href="http://kyndryl.com">Kyndryl</a>, one that, by the way, has revenue of $19 billion out of the gate as a public company. Whatever you think of this move, Kyndryl is a substantial company, yet IBM still saw itself better off without this considerable chunk of business.</p>
<p>According to an investor presentation provided by the nascent company, Kyndryl sees itself as a consulting arm for legacy companies to help them make the transition to more modern ways of doing business, a mission that would seem to fit with what IBM has been trying to do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">in recent years</a> with the company in general.</p>
<p>But when Big Blue announced its intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spin out this division</a> last year, it was clear that it was looking to move away from legacy business, and it saw infrastructure services as a piece that didn&#8217;t fit with CEO Arvind Krishna&#8217;s hybrid and AI-focused vision. As I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">in an analysis</a> of the move when it was announced:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>You don’t need to be a financial genius to see where the company is headed. Krishna clearly saw that it was time to start moving on from the legacy side of IBM’s business, even if there would be some short-term pain involved in doing so. So the executive put his resources into (as they say) where the puck is going. Today’s news is a continuation of that effort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategies believes both companies will ultimately benefit from the separation. &#8220;IBM was one of the last companies to spin out its lower-margin, lower innovation services companies. I think IBM will benefit most from [the shift in] focus in that it doesn&#8217;t require any more executive time [on this division] and it can now focus on growth areas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regarding Kyndryl, he says the newly formed company can begin to pick and choose where it wants to concentrate from a business perspective with more freedom than it could under the IBM umbrella. &#8220;Kyndryl can be more successful on its own as it can spend money on R&amp;D like automation that actually benefits [the business]. Mature businesses require a different kind of investment,&#8221; he said, and as a separate company it can begin making those kinds of key decisions.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J79kD6WnKu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/red-hat-continues-to-grow-but-ibms-struggles-continue/">Red Hat continues to grow, but IBM&#8217;s struggles continue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Red Hat continues to grow, but IBM&#8217;s struggles continue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/red-hat-continues-to-grow-but-ibms-struggles-continue/embed/#?secret=J79kD6WnKu" data-secret="J79kD6WnKu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, points out that since Kyndryl starts off with a big head start in the market. &#8220;[Spinning out Kyndryl] is a key move for IBM to find growth again and to be more profitable going forward which drives valuation. Kyndryl now has to show it can produce results on its own, and given it has been gifted a number of long-term contracts from IBM, that should not be an issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Kyndryl will be fine for the short term at least based on its existing contracts, it remains to be seen if the company can flourish on its own in the longer term in a changing technology landscape. Regardless, IBM is free to concentrate on its new vision. and while it will probably miss the revenue initially, it should benefit eventually from this arrangement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Has usage-based pricing gone mainstream? Out of nearly 600 SaaS companies surveyed, 45% said they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is usage-based pricing (UBP) going mainstream? That may be so, if you consider the results of Boston-based VC firm OpenView&#8217;s annual <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/">Financial and Operating Benchmarks survey</a>. Of the nearly 600 SaaS companies that responded, 45% say they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.</p>
<p>The survey also looks into how companies that adopt flexible pricing models perform compared to their counterparts, and how it impacts them more broadly. And since it doesn&#8217;t shy away from mentioning challenges, we felt it would be relevant reading for founders who might still be on the fence.</p>
<p>To get a deeper look into the results of the survey, we spoke with OpenView operating partner <a href="https://twitter.com/poyark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Poyar</a>, who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">championed usage-based pricing models in the past</a>, and co-authored the firm&#8217;s 2021 State of Usage-Based Pricing Report with partner <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanjiv Kalevar</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A usage-based pricing is an incredible message that you stand behind your products, and you truly believe your customers are going to be successful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The main insights are below, but before we jump in, here&#8217;s a note on definitions: the report&#8217;s definition of usage-based pricing adoption includes companies like Twilio, whose pricing is almost entirely pay-as-you-go, as well as those offering subscription tiers based on usage, like Zapier.</p>
<p>In other words, the report&#8217;s co-authors don&#8217;t draw the line at whether or not there&#8217;s a subscription element; instead, they consider if pricing is tied to product consumption behavior, as opposed to just seat-based pricing in a landscape where companies also charge based on customer size, functionality, services, or other factors.</p>
<h2>Why the seats are empty</h2>
<p>One of the factors driving this shift is that charging for &#8220;seats&#8221; makes less sense than it used to, according to OpenView. Poyar noted that the value a customer receives rarely ties in directly with how many people log in, especially as more and more startups now offer solutions built around automation, AI or APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it might even be negatively correlated: When AI can automate tasks, the more successful the solution is, the fewer people need to be logging in. So seats are just an outdated way of charging and don&#8217;t allow a company to communicate value or invest in features that would add more value.&#8221; While Poyar admitted that not every company does this, he pointed out that automation, APIs or AI often play a big role in the success of the companies going public today.</p>
<p>This might explain another shift in thinking: Many companies that go public &#8220;are calling out usage-based models and making it a focus of their S-1s or of their investor materials,&#8221; Poyar said. He added, &#8220;There used to be a fear that investors would penalize them for a usage-based model, because there was a fear that it wasn&#8217;t recurring revenue, and it wasn&#8217;t predictable. [ … ] Now, a usage-based revenue model is seen as a competitive advantage, and a driver of long-term growth.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.quintoandar.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuintoAndar</a> is taking its first steps out of Brazil to open a technology hub in Lisbon, Portugal aimed at attracting technology talent across the pond.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gabriel Braga made the announcement at Web Summit 2021 going on this week in Lisbon. The new office will serve as its first in Europe and will be operational in March, initially staffing up to 50 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The company touts itself as “the largest housing platform in Latin America,” providing selling and rental assistance, and also takes on the risk associated with monthly rental payments. QuintoAndar currently had more than 150,000 properties and $89 billion in assets under management and operates in more than 40 cities across Brazil.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The move comes six months after the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/quintoandar-raises-300m-at-a-4b-valuation-as-ribbit-capital-makes-a-big-bet-on-the-brazilian-proptech/">$300 million in Series E funding</a> that valued the company at $4 billion. In August, investors Tencent and Greenoaks added another $120 million to push valuation to $5.1 billion and over $700 million raised in total, Braga said.</p>
<p>He noted that the European region is home to a lot of technology talent, and the tech hub was something that had been in the works for awhile, but was postponed due to the global pandemic. Now that the company has embraced a hybrid work model, it is ready to take the step to expand internationally.</p>
<p>In addition to the presence in Portugal, QuintoAndar is also preparing to make a similar move to Mexico next year, Brag said.</p>
<p>“The new office is part of our long-term focus of building a world-class tech team and part of the funding will support that continuous investment,” he added. “We are based in Brazil, but more and more, we are bringing on people from all over the world to join us. Remote work made it easier in some ways and hard in others, but now we have more people spread out.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
