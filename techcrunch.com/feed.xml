										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The year of the first-ever all-virtual CES is, unsurprisingly, the year of the virtual gym. The past 12 months have seen most of our fitness routines completely transformed &#8212; speaking for myself, my Apple Watch step count shows two big empty spots where March and April are.</p>
<p>Fitness startups have seen unexpected windfall in all of this. In June, Lululemon announced plans to acquire Mirror for $500 million, while competitors like Tonal saw a 7x increase in sales for the year. In December, Apple launched Fitness+, its own on-demand service designed to take on the Pelotons of the world.</p>
<p>It’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re starting to see a streaming service-style land rush on the fitness side of things. It’s a massive industry, of course, and odds are things will never return exactly to “normal” in the wake of all of this, but unlike movie services, it’s hard to imagine people subscribing to more than one at a time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=uyPBzLp7UX" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest name to enter the market thus far at CES is Samsung. The electronics giant announced Smart Trainer, an addition to its growing line of fitness-focused apps. The system is designed specially for Samsung’s Smart TVs, using a webcam to track exercises. On that front, at least, it seems to be a bit more in-depth than Apple’s Watch-only tracking, which relies on an accelerometer and heart-rate monitor for feedback. Like Fitness+, it will employ trainers to lead exercises, including workout celebrity Jillian Michaels.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman is another major fitness video platform making its debut this week. The startup recently closed an $8 million round. Like Fitness+, its biotracking is built around the Apple Watch, showcasing heart rate and calories burned, among other metrics. The service compares its offering to a “masterclass” for fitness.</p>
<p>Partners include leading athletes and celebrities like Crossfit champion Kara Saunders, fitness celebrity Amanda Cerny, coach Johannes Bartl, hybrid athlete and coach Kris Gethin and MindSize CEO Christian Straka to name a few. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app also integrates biofeedback via its Apple Watch integration to measure and improve the efficacy of meditation and workouts. Compared to Calm and Headspace&#8217;s celebrity content approach, Ultrahuman uses a technology platform-based approach to improve experience and long-term results.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/">It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/embed/#?secret=PG9spLbhpH" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These services set themselves apart from the likes of Mirror, Peloton and new offerings from the likes of NordicTrack, in that these technologies ditch the heavy exercise equipment, lowering the barrier of entry (though I suppose Samsung’s does require a big, expensive TV). The fact is that demand will decrease when people feel more comfortable going to the gym. That will certainly shake out the industry to a certain extent.</p>
<p>For many people, however, once the secrets of home fitness have been unlocked, they may never want to visit the gym again.</p>

In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday afternoon, Jurvetson [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://future.ventures/">Future Ventures</a> &#8212; cofounded by venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko, a colleague of Jurvetson at his last firm, DFJ, as well as an investor previously with Airbus Ventures and Khosla Ventures &#8212; has closed its second fund with $200 million in capital commitments, say the pair.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday afternoon, Jurvetson characterized the fund as &#8220;dramatically oversubscribed in a fairly short period of time,&#8221; adding that roughly one-third of its investors are venture capitalists or other investors, that the &#8220;second largest bucket [comprises] tech executives, CEOs, and former CEOs of enormous companies of relevance to our ecosystem&#8221; and that the last third of the firm&#8217;s capital is coming from institutions, including one university endowment. (He didn&#8217;t specify which.)</p>
<p>As with Future&#8217;s $200 million debut fund, which closed two years ago, the outfit&#8217;s newest vehicle has a 15-year time horizon, giving it more leeway to make longer-term bets. Jurvetson also confirmed that as with that debut fund, Future features fairly standard economics, including charging 2.5% in management fees and 25% in so-called carried interest (meaning the share of the profits that Future keeps from its investments).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We tell our LPs, &#8216;Look, this is a long game, these companies take longer than five to seven years to come to full maturity, &#8221; said Jurvetson, who has been on the board of SpaceX since 2009 and, along with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/business/tesla-directors-resign.html"> three other directors</a>, left the board of Tesla in September, following a 13-year run as a director. &#8220;They may go public in that timeframe. But as you can see with Tesla and SpaceX and some of the greatest tech stories of our day, you really would regret having feel pressured to punch out early when they&#8217;re really in the greatest phases of torrid growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the fund could have been bigger. Jurvetson has been doing business with Elon Musk for more than 20 years, and beyond his early involvement with SpaceX and Tesla, Future participated in the first round of Musk&#8217;s tunnel-based transportation system, Boring Company.</p>
<p>It wrote the first check to Musk&#8217;s neurotechnology startup, Neuralink, which last summer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/take-a-closer-look-at-elon-musks-neuralink-surgical-robot/">unveiled its progress</a> toward developing implantable brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes that Musk helps will eventually help to cure conditions like Alzheimer’s, dementia and spinal cord injuries, among other things.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX is now an 18-year-old company, Future has a stake in that business, too. In fact, Future&#8217;s first check went to Space X, and the firm last year raised a $100 million SpaceX SPV in just five days &#8212; capital that Saenko said came from most of the firm&#8217;s fund one investors, along with some additional investors who were able to get to know the firm through the process.</p>
<p>These pop-up type funds won&#8217;t happen routinely, according to Jurvetson. &#8220;We communicated in our fundraising that a special situation, maybe two, would occur where we do a later-stage, large check, single investment in a company we have immense conviction in, and we didn&#8217;t anticipate that to happen right away, but the opportunity to reopen the prior year&#8217;s round [in SpaceX] and join an extension of that close made it very tempting to do on behalf of the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, the plan is to continue writing mostly small checks &#8212; $3.8 million on average &#8212; that represent the first checks raised by startups. The idea is to back around 20 companies from the new fund (as with the last) and to take a more relaxed view on board seats than might other firms. Part of that owes to necessity, suggests Saenko, noting that the two only have so much bandwidth, but also she said could &#8220;not think of a single situation where we&#8217;re not fully in the information flow of the company&#8221; even without a director role, which is often why VCs insist on one.</p>
<p>In the meantime, well beyond its Musk-related bets, Future has been assembling a portfolio that&#8217;s wide-ranging, with investments tied to cellular manufacturing, longevity, and edge AI, among other things.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, it was announced that it led a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/sensei-gets-uma-thurman-tesla-board-member-as-investors">follow-on round</a> in <a href="https://senseibio.com/">Sensei Biotherapeutics</a>, a 21-year-old, Boston-based developer of personalized cancer drugs that&#8217;s planning a public offering this year and which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a> to induce an adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>Future, which is also investor in the lab-grown meat producer <a href="https://www.memphismeats.com/">Memphis Meats</a>, is also very focused right now on regenerative agriculture and permaculture, which is an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Said Saenko, &#8220;I think it would behoove all of us to look at our food industry and ask what are the ways in which we are currently feeding our global population that are unsustainable in the future, given the number of people that we have and are going to continue having on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does not interest the pair are other trends sweeping the venture industry right now, from space investing to moving out of California.</p>
<p>On space investing, Jurvetson &#8212; who led DFJ&#8217;s investment in both SpaceX and the satellite company Planet &#8212; said it&#8217;s far too crowded at this point (&#8220;though I&#8217;m going to be a space tourist one day for sure&#8221;).</p>
<p>As for moving &#8212; as Musk did recently to Austin &#8212; Saenko isn&#8217;t going anywhere, she said. Neither is Jurvetson, who spent 12 years in Texas, including in high school, and calls it a &#8220;hellhole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly,&#8221; he said yesterday, &#8220;many of my friends have punched out and gone to Texas or Florida.&#8221; He berates them for it, too, added. &#8220;If you become wealthy enough as an investor or an entrepreneur such that you could choose to live anywhere you want in your life, why in the world would you pick up and go to some godforsaken place now? Just to avoid capital gains tax? How about, for example, donate to charity instead and avoid that capital gains tax?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;different way to look at the world rather than just trying to do wealth transfer and preservation across generations; that just feels so short sighted to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get them started on the blank-check companies that have come into vogue as a path for more automotive companies in particular to become publicly traded. For example, Lucid Motors, the California EV startup that gave up majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund last year in exchange for $1.3 billion, is reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac">in talks to go public</a> through a merger with one of the special purpose acquisition vehicles of Wall Street veteran Michael Klein.</p>
<p>Faraday Future, another electric vehicle startup, is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/faraday-future-spac-targeting-3-billion-public-debut-electric-vehicles-2021-1-1029956718">reportedly looking to go public</a> via a merger with a separate SPAC sponsor.</p>
<p>Asked what Future Ventures makes of the trend, Jurvetson &#8212; who experienced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/confirmed-six-months-after-leaving-dfj-steve-jurvetson-is-starting-new-venture-firm/">high-profile split</a> from DFJ in 2017 (DFJ later reorganized as <a href="https://threshold.vc/">Threshold Ventures</a>) &#8212;  did not mince words about the electric vehicle category in particular. &#8220;It would be really refreshing if a decent company was included in the mix, but it is just a rogue&#8217;s gallery of horrific companies.&#8221; Mostly, he continued, &#8220;these are companies that unable to raise a penny from any other source.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saenko was more diplomatic if no more optimistic about some of the tie-ups being pieced together right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying that every SPAC company is a terrible company,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think what we&#8217;re saying is that everyone should be very wary of these companies because of Steve&#8217;s point that they&#8217;re early-stage companies and the SPAC is solely a fundraising system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Public market investors &#8220;expect a particular level of maturity and progress and meaningful forecasting from the companies that are on the public markets,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just not going to be true of the vast majority of the companies that have gone through SPACs. And that could have a potentially terrible blowback on the entire tech industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Visa and Plaid called off their agreement this afternoon, ending the consumer credit giant&#8217;s takeover of the data-focused fintech API startup.</p>
<p>The deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">valued at $5.3 billion at the time of its announcement</a>, first broke cover on January 13, 2020, or nearly one year ago to the day. However, the Department of Justice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">filed suit to block the deal in November of 2020</a>, arguing that the combination would &#8220;eliminate a nascent competitive threat that would likely result in substantial savings and more innovative online debit services for merchants and consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time Visa argued that the government&#8217;s point of view was &#8220;flawed.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, today the two companies confirmed the deal is officially off. In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006080/en/Visa-and-Plaid-Announce-Mutual-Termination-of-Merger-Agreement">a release</a> Visa wrote that it could have eventually executed the deal, but that &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; would take lots of time to sort out.</p>
<p>It all got too hard, in other words.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RFLE9k44VS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/">Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/embed/#?secret=RFLE9k44VS" data-secret="RFLE9k44VS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Plaid was a bit more upbeat in its own notes, writing that in the last year it has seen &#8220;an unprecedented uptick in demand for the services powered by Plaid.&#8221; Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">the fintech boom that 2020 saw</a>, as consumers flocked to free stock trading apps and neobanks, that Plaid saw growth last year is not surprising. After all, Plaid&#8217;s product sits between consumers and fintech companies, so if those parties were executing more transactions, the API startup likely saw more demand for its own offerings.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Plaid for comment on its plans as an independent company, also asking how quickly it grew during 2020. <em><strong>Update: </strong>Plaid responded to TechCrunch noting that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. If we presume even moderate net dollar retention amongst its customer base, Plaid could have grown by triple-digits last year, in percentage terms.</em></p>
<p>While the Visa-Plaid deal was merely a single transaction, its scuttling doesn&#8217;t bode well for other fintech startups and unicorns that might have eyed an exit to a wealthy incumbent. The Department of Justice, in other words, may have undercut the chances of M&amp;A exits for a number of fintech-focused startups or at least created more skittishness around that possible exit path.</p>
<p>If so, expected exit valuations for fintech upstarts could fall. And that could ding both fintech-focused venture capital activity, and the price at which startups in the niche can raise funds. If the Visa-Plaid deal was a huge boon to fintech companies that used it as a signpost to help raise money at new, higher valuations, the inverse may also prove true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sono Motors wants to bring technology it developed for its solar electric car to the masses. And it&#8217;s starting with autonomous shuttle startup EasyMile.</p>
<p>The German-based startup said Tuesday during a presentation at the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that it will license its solar body panel technology to other companies. EasyMile, which provides electric autonomous shuttle buses to governments, universities and other companies, will be the first to integrate the solar body panels onto its vehicles, according to Sono Motors co-founder and CEO Laurin Hahn, who made the announcement after the company&#8217;s next-generation Sion solar electric car was revealed.</p>
<p>From afar, the Sono Motors&#8217; electric Sion vehicle looks like a compact car with black paint. Upon closer inspection, the entire exterior of the vehicle is actually comprised of hundreds of solar cells that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This makes them <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lighter, robust, cheaper and more efficient than any other technology available at the present in the markets, according to Arun Ramakrishnan, senior solar integration manager at Sono Motors, who added that they can be integrated into almost any object. </span></p>
<p>The solar body panels are lightweight — comparable to traditional body panels on today&#8217;s modern cars — and the polymer coating prevents the cells from splintering, the company said.</p>
<p>These solar cells convert sunlight into energy, which is stored in the vehicle&#8217;s battery. The solar cells, which work if a vehicle is driving or parked, can add up nearly 21.7 miles of range per day on the Sion car, the company said, noting that these stats are based on average weather in Munich.</p>
<p>The aim is to make vehicles less dependent on charging infrastructure, Hahn said.</p>

<p>The solar body panels aren&#8217;t designed to replace traditional charging methods. However, it can reduce how often the vehicle needs to be plugged in. Sono Motors noted that the solar integration in the Sion car extends the need to plug in from once a week to every four weeks, stats based on an average daily commute in Germany of 10 miles.</p>
<p>Sono Motors showed Tuesday a trailer outfitted with the solar body panels, just one use case for the technology. The trailer, which is just a prototype, is capable of generating up to 80 kilowatt hours per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just imagine the massive potential,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ramakrishnan said, noting that the tech could be used by </span>refrigerated trucks or other fleets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">Techstars</a>, a network of startup accelerators and a venture capital fund, announced that <a href="https://twitter.com/maellegavet?lang=en">Maëlle Gavet</a> is its new CEO. Former CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Brown</a> will stay on Techstars&#8217; board, while the group&#8217;s other co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcohen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Cohen</a>, will become the chairman of its board.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Gavet this morning about her new job, the timing of the change, the company&#8217;s plans for expansion and her goals in the role.</p>
<p>Gavet, who said she was brought aboard to help Techstars grow, detailed her work experience at prior roles in companies of greater scale and multiple geographies, including Compass and Booking.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch was curious, given how large the startup market is, how much space there is left for Techstars to expand into new geographies and niches. Gavet said that she had asked the same question to Techstars when she was being recruited for her new role. She said there is a wealth of overlooked talent and underinvested geographies that could be empowered and unlocked with capital and help. Techstars wants to go find those founders and invest in them.</p>
<p>That means, we presume, more accelerators in more places investing in more founders.</p>
<p>Gavet told TechCrunch that Techstars has invested in over 2,300 companies and is putting capital into around 500 yearly.</p>
<p>The new CEO explained that she believes it is possible to generate strong returns for her investors while providing lots of support for entrepreneurs and having a positive social impact. That&#8217;s an ambitious list of things to execute at once, but if she succeeds her effort could help diversify the world of tech entrepreneurs, something that has long been needed.</p>
<p>Seeing a startup exchange leaders to optimize for different, and larger-scale, operating experience is not rare. For a meta-startup, an accelerator-and-investing concern, to do the same is not surprising.</p>
<p>TechCrunch regularly covers accelerator cohorts, including Techstars (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/">some recent</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/10-favorite-startups-from-techstars-october-2020-class/">notes here</a>) and Y Combinator, among other programs. Some of tech&#8217;s biggest names have come out of such accelerator groups, historically, including Airbnb (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">now public</a>) from<a href="https://twitter.com/mwseibel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Michael Seibel</a>-led <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>, TalkDesk (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/talkdesk-series-c--500e9b13">worth over $3 billion</a>) from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinesltsai/">Christine Tsai</a>-led <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>, and Techstars&#8217; own SendGrid (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/twilio-acquires-email-api-platform-sendgrid-for-2-billion-in-stock/">bought by Twilio for $2 billion</a>).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where Techstars takes its accelerator model next &#8212; the group sometimes partners with companies, or groups like the United States Air Force to sponsor and support tailored programs &#8212; in terms of location and focus. But if it can successfully help diversify the founder pool at the same time as making itself money, it will underscore how others in its market could do better.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided for businesses, one of its main legacies is how it ushered in a tidal wave of accelerated digital transformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/covid-19-digital-engagement-report">A recent Twilio survey</a> revealed that 97% of global enterprise decision-makers believe the pandemic sped up their company’s digital transformation, and on top of that, 79% of the respondents said that COVID-19 increased the budget for digital transformation.</p>
<p>As technology becomes the driving force of competitive differentiation, cloud plays a key role in making this a reality and impacts everything from data and analytics to the modern workplace. Cloud-based infrastructure promises more flexibility, scale and cost-effectiveness, as well as enables enterprises to have more agile application development and keep up with service demand.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What’s clear is that despite shortfalls in security, innovation in cloud and infrastructure will charge ahead.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even with all of the hype and excitement around cloud’s potential, it is still early days. In his recent keynote at AWS re:Invent, the <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/cloud/andy-jassy-speed-is-not-preordained-its-a-choice/d/d-id/1339571?">AWS CEO Andy Jassy mentioned</a> that spending on cloud computing is still only 4% of the overall IT market. And <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1318675611557056512">a Barclays CIO survey</a> found that enterprises have 30% of their workloads running in the public cloud, with the expectation to increase to 39% in 2021.</p>
<p>It’s become clear that the movement to cloud has its barriers and that large enterprises are often skittish to make the jump. <a href="https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020">Flexera’s State of the Cloud 2020 report</a> outlined some of these top cloud challenges, citing security as #1. This has been widely apparent in conversations that I’ve had with Fortune 500 CISOs and security teams, who are wary of the shift from their current state of security operations. Some of the major concerns brought up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer your own master. When working with the public cloud providers, companies must relinquish control to some aspects of back-end management. This is tough for large enterprises who have a history of customizing products because you can’t completely tailor the environment to your liking and are limited to what’s on the cloud service provider’s platform.</li>
<li>Lack of standardization. Each cloud provider has their own solutions and own intricacies. Add to that other pitfalls, like an unknown cadence of updates, there is an opaqueness to interoperability and policies can’t be uniformly applied across environments.</li>
<li>Requires a new skill set. Lack of resources/expertise ranks among the top challenges for enterprises.<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/86-of-it-decision-makers-believe-shortage-of-talent-will-slow-down-2020-cloud-projects-301004464.html"> A recent report on challenges in cloud transformation</a> found that 86% of IT decision-makers believe shortage of talent will slow down 2020 cloud projects.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://youandmrjones.com">You &amp; Mr. Jones</a> announced today that it has added $60 million in new funding from Merian Chrysalis, bringing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-mr-jones-valued-at-1-3-billion-brandtech-company-says-11575977400">the Series B round </a>announced in December to a total of $260 million.</p>
<p>The round values the company at $1.36 billion, post-money.</p>
<p>You &amp; Mr. Jones takes its name from CEO David Jones, who founded the company in 2015. After having served as the CEO of ad giant Havas, Jones told me that his goal in starting what he called &#8220;a brand tech group&#8221; was to provide marketers with something that neither traditional agencies nor technology companies could give them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At that moment, the choices were to go work with an agency group, which is great at brand and marketing, but they don’t understand tech, or with a tech company, which will only ever recommend their platform and don&#8217;t have the same [brand and marketing] expertise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So You &amp; Mr. Jones has built its own technology platform to help marketers with their digital, mobile and e-commerce needs, while also investing in companies like Pinterest and Niantic. And it makes acquisitions — last year, for example, <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/06/you-mr-jones-elevates-influencer-offering-with-acquisition-collectively">it bought influencer marketing company Collectively</a>.</p>

<p>You &amp; Mr. Jones has grown to 3,000 employees, and its clients include Unilever, Accenture, Google, Adidas, Marriott and Microsoft. In fact, Jones said that as of the third quarter of 2020, its net revenue had grown 27% year over year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s particularly impressive given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/5-vcs-agree-the-pandemic-has-reshaped-adtech-and-martech/">the impact of the pandemic on ad spending</a>, but Jones said that&#8217;s one of the key distinctions between digital advertising and the broader brand tech category, which he said has grown steadily, even during the pandemic, and which also sets the company apart from agencies that are &#8220;digital and tech in press release only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not an ad agency, we&#8217;ll never acquire agencies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the technology platform, process and people to deliver all of your end-to-end, always-on content — social, digital, e-commerce and community management.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company is announcing that it has hired Paulette Forte, who was previously senior director of human services at the NBA, as its first chief people officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brand tech category didn’t even exist before You &amp; Mr Jones was established,&#8221; Forte said in a statement. &#8220;The company became a true industry disruptor in short order, and growth has been swift. In order to keep up with the momentum, it’s critical to have systems in place that help talent develop their skills, encourage diversity and creativity, and find pathways to improving workflow. I am excited to join the leadership team to drive this crucial work forward.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because streaming services only release viewership numbers selectively, and because each one uses its own methodology, it can be hard to compare the popularity of different streaming shows and movies.</p>
<p>So Nielsen, which provides the standard ratings for traditional TV (and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/nielsen-one/">working to combine those ratings with streaming data</a>), is offering some apples-to-apples comparison today at CES by releasing its own lists of the most popular streaming content in 2020, across Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Hulu.</p>
<p>These lists are limited to U.S. viewership. Unlike Nielsen&#8217;s linear ratings, they don&#8217;t just reflect the total number of people watching, but focus instead on the total number of minutes watched. That also makes for a striking contrast with the ratings that Netflix releases, which count the number of households who watched at least two minutes of a program, but don&#8217;t distinguish between someone who watches two minutes versus two hours versus 20 hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, the TV series lists are absolutely dominated by Netflix, while Disney+ puts in a good showing on the movies list. The other services don&#8217;t crack any of the three Top 10 lists.</p>
<p>On the original series side, the surprising winner (at least, surprising to me) was Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Ozark,&#8221; with 30.5 billion minutes streamed, followed by &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; (19 billion minutes) and &#8220;The Crown&#8221; (16.3 billion minutes). &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; which seems like one of the defining hits of the pandemic, came in at number four, with 15.7 billion minutes streamed — though Nielsen&#8217;s methodology puts it at a disadvantage, since it only has eight episodes. The same could probably be said for &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; the first non-Netflix series on the list, with 14.5 billion minutes streamed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095331" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095331" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095331" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="Nielsen 2020 list" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg 1895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095331" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nielsen</p></div></p>
<p>The numbers were even bigger for acquired series — all of them streaming on Netflix last year, although the number one show, &#8220;The Office&#8221; (57.1 billion minutes streamed) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix">just moved to Peacock</a>. The other shows in the top five are &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; (39.4 billon minutes), &#8220;Criminal Minds&#8221; (35.4 billion minutes), &#8220;NCIS&#8221; (28.1 billion minutes) and &#8220;Schitt&#8217;s Creek&#8221; (23.8 billion minutes).</p>
<p>On the movie side, the biggest title was &#8220;Frozen II,&#8221; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/14/homebound-parents-rejoice-disney-is-releasing-frozen-2-on-its-streamer-on-sunday/">came early to Disney+</a> and was streamed for 14.9 billion minutes, followed by &#8220;Moana&#8221; (Disney+, 10.5 billion minutes), &#8220;The Secret Life of Pets 2&#8221; (Netflix, 9.1 billion minutes), &#8220;Onward&#8221; (Disney+, 8.4 billion minutes) and &#8220;Dr. Seuss&#8217; The Grinch&#8221; (6.2 billion minutes). This seems to be a category where family films have advantage, perhaps because kids are more likely to watch them multiple times.</p>
<p>Beyond releasing these lists, Nielsen is announcing a new product designed to measure viewership of theatrical video on-demand, aka movies that are released for rent or purchase online. While studios should already have access to basic purchase data for these titles, Nielsen says it can provide &#8220;the entire media food chain&#8221; with more detailed information about things like the age, gender, ethnicity and geographic territory of who&#8217;s watching.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nielsen&#8217;s general manager of audience measurement Scott N. Brown said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As this unprecedented pandemic continues to influence consumer behavior, perhaps even through a prolonged state of recovery waves, being able to measure and help clients appropriately monetize new revenue streams has never been more crucial. A bigger question might be what will audiences do following any recovery, how the behavior adopted during stay-at-home orders might influence habits when consumers have the ability to go back to theaters to enjoy that experience and how content creators will leverage data to make the best decisions regarding distribution platforms in the future.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outdoor cooking industry leader and famed kettle-grill-maker Weber has acquired June, the smart cooking startup founded in 2013 by Matt Van Horn and Nikhil Bhogal. While financial terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, Weber has confirmed that June will continue to operate as its own brand wholly owned by Weber-Stephen Products and will continue to both sell and develop the June Oven and related products. Meanwhile, June co-founder Nikhil Bhogal will take on a role as SVP of Technology and Connected Devices across the Weber lineup.</p>
<p>Weber had already teamed up with June, with the startup providing the technology and expertise behind its Weber Connect smart grilling platform. That includes both the Weber Connect Smart Grilling Hub, which adds connected smart grill features to any grill, and the built-in smart cooking features on its SmokeFire line of wood pellet grills. That partnership began with a cold email Van Horn received in 2018 from then-Weber CEO and current Executive Chairman Jim Stephen, the son of the company&#8217;s original founder.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was a fan, he was a customer, and he couldn&#8217;t imagine a future without June technology powering every product in the Weber collection,&#8221; Van Horn told me in an interview. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Slow down — what are you talking about? Yeah, who are you?&#8217; And he said &#8216;I&#8217;m flying out, I&#8217;ll be there Monday.'&#8221; I normally have my nice demo setup that I do, I&#8217;ll do like chocolate lava cake and a steak [in the June Oven]. So I got there about 15 minutes early to do that, and [Jim] was already sitting in the front steps of the office, ready to open the door for me — he&#8217;s like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t need a demo, I own this.'&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;His energy and ability to see things often before other people, it blew my mind,&#8221; Van Horn continued. &#8220;Soon after I met Chris [Scherzinger, Weber&#8217;s current chief executive], who was joining as CEO and [I] was able to experience firsthand this, honestly very surprising and wonderful culture of this historic Weber brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>As mentioned, June became a partner to Weber and powered the connected cooking platform it debuted at CES last year. Weber also led June&#8217;s Series C funding round, a previously undisclosed final round of financing that Weber led in 2018 prior to this exit.</p>
<p>Van Horn will act as president of June under the terms of the new arrangement and will continue to lead development of its current and future products. He said that Weber&#8217;s ability to help them with international scale and distribution via their existing global footprint was a big motivating factor in why June chose to join the now 63-year-old company. But another key ingredient was just how much Weber proved to be a place where the company&#8217;s culture was still centered on customer focus and a love of food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously why Nikhil and I started June was that we love food, and we love cooking,&#8221; Van Horn said. &#8220;And a lot of the principles of how we think about how products get made are a lot of Apple&#8217;s principles — a large percentage of the June team comes from Apple. We&#8217;ve obviously kind of brought that to a microscale with our small 60-person startup. But being able to work with this very eager Weber team, that&#8217;s just been really excited from the start has been pretty incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Weber, the company gains a software and technology team that was born out of the idea of approaching cooking from a tech-first perspective — and they intend to infuse that expertise throughout their product lineup, with an eye toward building on their legacy of quality and customer enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you infuse the software engineering, the connected product design and the machine-intelligence expertise that you have, you get these core competencies or capabilities, but that really undersells it,&#8221; Scherzinger told me. &#8220;Matt put together a team of superstars, and we just got a first-round draft pick [in June] that takes the Weber game to another level. That allows us to accelerate a significant number of initiatives, and you can expect to see an expansion of what Weber Connect can become in terms of new experiences for consumers, new services and new products, for sure, starting as early as 2021 and 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Weber and June are not sharing specifics around the deal, as mentioned, Scherzinger did mention that &#8220;Matt and his team and his investors all did handsomely.&#8221; June&#8217;s prior investors include Amazon Alexa Fund, Lerer Hippeau, First Round Capital, Promus Ventures, Industry Ventures, Eclipse Ventures and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis has always been essential to some. While it had seemed to start last year in a bit of a correction, demand for it during the pandemic (and its widespread designation as an essential business), created a breakthrough for the industry. We saw early signs of that in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/where-these-6-top-vcs-are-investing-in-cannabis/">cannabis investor survey back in May of 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Today, TechCrunch has surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the cannabis business, based on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/?verticals=576769646">TechCrunch List</a> of top investors who founders recommend to us, and other sources. We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches. Despite remaining headwinds, the future is looking up for most cannabis businesses, according to these investors.</p>
<p>Morgan Paxhia, managing director of Poseidon Investment Management, put it this way: &#8220;2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&amp;A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It&#8217;s going to be fun!&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>Morgan Paxhia, managing director, <a href="https://www.poseidonassetmanagement.com/">Poseidon Investment Management</a></li>
<li>Emily Paxhia, managing partner, <a href="https://www.poseidonassetmanagement.com/">Poseidon Investment Management</a></li>
<li>Anthony Coniglio, CEO, <a href="https://www.newlake.com/">NewLake Capital</a></li>
<li>Matt Shalhoub, managing partner, <a href="https://www.greenacrecapital.ca/">Green Acre Capital</a></li>
<li>Jerel Registre, managing director, <a href="https://curiowellness.com/curio-news/">Curio WMBE Fund</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Morgan Paxhia, managing director, Poseidon Investment Management</h2>
<p><strong>2020 was a blockbuster year for cannabis. What advice are you giving your portfolio companies entering 2021?</strong></p>
<p>Typical mantra for us, stay focused. Markets, deals and valuations are volatile in our industry but we all have to do our best to tune out the noise and focus. I&#8217;d say a great example of a team with focus is GTI. They have executed against a strategy while many of their supposed peers have done very irrational deals, impaired shareholder value, etc. GTI continues to march down its path and their results are showing.</p>
<p><strong>How is COVID-19 changing the cannabis landscape?</strong></p>
<p>2020 was an inward-facing year as most companies could not travel, capital was tight and macro was uncertain. This inward work has led to a lot of fundamental improvements for operators. There are others that got one last puff of wind but their businesses are too impaired and will continue to fall to the wayside.</p>
<p>2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&amp;A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It&#8217;s going to be fun!</p>
<p><strong>From retail to SaaS to research, there&#8217;s a lot of inroads to investing in cannabis. What sector of the business do you see has the best opportunity for growth in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>We are bullish on select state markets. For example, new adult-use markets in NJ and AZ and existing markets with new growth prospects opening in CA and NY.</p>
<p>SaaS could get very interesting as there are several players reaching scale that are garnering mainstream attention.<br />
International opportunity is mostly Mexico. It is the largest federally legal market that will just be opening in 2021. Many have not taken this one seriously but we have and are very proud of the efforts that went to moving such a monumental step forward.</p>
<p><strong>The history of drug enforcement in the United States has been deeply unjust and racist; as we enter a period of growing legalization, are there things that startups and investors can do to address that inequity?</strong></p>
<p>The industry, meaning established companies, entrepreneurs and investors need to drive solutions here. Regulations have been terrible and only exacerbate the issue. We have been putting a lot of thought into this area for years, watching various aspects such as the missteps taken by government and the unfortunate poor intentions from supposed investors.</p>
<p>We see a path emerging here that is collaborative, simple and should be attractive to capital providers. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some leaders in the cannabis space &#8212; companies, founders, growers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My sister Emily is a co-founder and rock star! She is a true leader in this space on so many levels.</li>
<li>Ahmer Iqbal, CEO of Sublime — Ahmer took the role at a very challenging time and with very little capital was able to rebuild the company into a leader in the CA market.</li>
<li>Jason Wild — Not only is he a savvy investor, he puts his money where his mouth is. Outside of Poseidon, I do not know any other person in this industry that puts up so much of their own money into what they believe in.</li>
<li>Coleman Beale, CEO of Bastcore — If you are not familiar with the industrial hemp renaissance in the U.S., look no further. This technology-driven hemp-processing company is rejuvenating textiles in the U.S., using domestically grown hemp and processing for uses in such textiles as denim.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer online shopping habits have led to a windfall of revenues for these web storefronts, but COVID-era trends have also breathed new life into the market for developer tools that help e-commerce sites operate more smoothly for shoppers.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of many e-commerce infrastructure startups to earn attention from investors amid COVID.</p>
<p>The web services company helps streamline the backends of e-commerce websites with a so-called &#8220;headless&#8221; platform that shifts how the front end of websites interact with content in the back end. The startup claims its tech can boost performance, promote better scalability, cut down on hosting costs and offer developers a more streamlined experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nacelle has closed an $18 million Series A led by Inovia with participation from Accomplice, Index Ventures, High Alpha, Silas Capital and Lerer Hippeau. The company just closed a $4.8 million seed round in mid-2020, the speedy pace of their Series A&#8217;s close seems to speak to the investor enthusiasm that has deepened around companies operating in the e-commerce world.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;It’s not secret that commerce has done well during COVID,&#8221; CEO Brian Anderson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Not only did we get this subtle structural change with COVID that I believe is long-lasting, but merchants have been focusing more on performance.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One of the startup&#8217;s central points of focus has been ensuring that they can bring customers onboard its platform without causing undue headaches. It can be &#8220;very painful to migrate data&#8221; with other services, Anderson says. The company&#8217;s service is &#8220;anti-rip-and-replace,&#8221; meaning potential </span>customers can integrate &#8220;without having to be rebuild their stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s customer base is largely made up of small- to medium-sized e-commerce sites. Nacelle works closely with agencies for customer referrals, also tapping on Anderson&#8217;s past contacts from his days running a Shopify Plus agency.</p>
<p>This past August, data from IBM’s U.S. Retail Index suggested that pandemic trends had accelerated the consumer shift from primarily visiting to physical stores to shopping on e-commerce storefronts by roughly five years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft continue to find their feet in a new landscape for transportation services &#8212; where unessential travel is being actively discouraged in many markets and people remain concerned about catching the coronavirus in restricted, shared spaces &#8212; a smaller player that has carved out a place for itself targeting business users is announcing more funding.</p>
<p><a href="http://gett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gett</a>, which started out as a more direct competitor to the likes of Uber and Lyft but now focuses mainly on ground transportation services for business clients in major cities around the world, said in a short statement that it has closed a round of $115 million. The company &#8212; co-headquartered in London and Israel &#8212; also said it is now &#8220;operationally profitable&#8221; and is hitting its budget targets.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by new backer Pelham Capital Investments Ltd. and also included participation from unnamed existing investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Including this round, Gett has now raised $865 million, with past investors including VW, Access and its founder Len Blavatnik<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/len-blavatnik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="len-blavatnik">,&nbsp;</a>Kreos, MCI and more. Gett&#8217;s last confirmed valuation was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/gett-raises-200m-at-1-5b-valuation-for-its-b2b-ride-hailing-service-aims-for-2020-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 billion</a>, pegged to a $200 million fundraise in May 2019. It&#8217;s not talking about current valuation, or any recent customer numbers, today.</p>
<p>Dave Waiser, Gett&#8217;s founder and CEO, described the funding earlier today in a note to me as an extension to the company&#8217;s previous round, a $100 million equity investment that it announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/gett-raises-100m-more-to-double-down-on-its-b2b-on-demand-ride-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July last year</a>.</p>
<p>Chairman Amos Genish, said in a statement that the funding round was oversubscribed, &#8220;which shows the market’s interest in our platform and long-term vision. Gett is disrupting and transforming a fragmented market delivering ever-critical cost optimisation and client satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has been building out a focus on the B2B market for several years now &#8212; a smart way of avoiding the expensive and painful race to compete like-for-like against the Ubers of the world &#8212; and this most recent round is focused on doubling down on that.</p>
<p>The Gett of the past &#8212; it was originally founded in 2010 under the name GetTaxi &#8212; did indeed try to build a business around both consumers and higher-end users, but the idea behind Gett today is to focus on corporate accounts.</p>
<p>Gett provides those businesses&#8217; employees with a predictable and reliable app-based platform to make it easier to order car services wherever they happen to be traveling, and those businesses &#8212; which in the past would have used a fragmented mix of local services &#8212; then have a consolidated way of managing, accounting for and analysing those travel expenses. It claims to be able to save companies some 25%-40% in costs.</p>
<p>The company previously said that its network covered some 1,500 cities. In certain metropolitan areas like London and Moscow, Gett provides transportation services directly. In markets where it does not have direct operations (such as anywhere in the U.S., including New York), it partners with third parties, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/juno-shuts-down-its-operations-in-nyc-as-owner-gett-signs-strategic-partnership-with-lyft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Lyft</a>.</p>
<p>“We are on a journey to transform corporate ground travel and I’m delighted that investors find our model attractive,&#8221; Waiser said in a statement today. &#8220;This investment will allow us to further develop our SaaS technology and deepen our proposition within the corporate ground travel market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union filed a lawsuit today alleging Proposition 22 violates California&#8217;s constitution. The goal of the suit is to overturn Prop 22, which classifies gig workers as independent contractors in California.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in California&#8217;s Supreme Court, argues Prop 22 makes it harder for the state&#8217;s legislature to create and enforce a workers&#8217; compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eights legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, rideshare drivers like me struggle to make ends meet because companies like Uber and Lyft prioritize corporate profits over our well-being,&#8221; Saori Okawa, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. &#8220;With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution. I’m joining this lawsuit because I know it’s up to the people we elect to make our laws, not wealthy executives who profit from our labor. I’m confident the court will see Prop 22 for the corporate power grab that it is, and that Prop 22 will live in infamy along with unconstitutional ballot measures like Prop 8 and Prop 187.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This suit is the latest in a long battle between gig workers and tech companies. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft have their eyes on pursuing Prop 22-like legislation elsewhere. Given Uber and Lyft’s anti-gig-workers-as-employees stance, it came as no surprise when Uber and Lyft separately said they would pursue similar legislation in other parts of the country and the world.</p>
<p>Uber, Lyft and DoorDash were not immediately available for comment. But the group behind Yes on 22, Protect App Based Jobs &amp; Services, provided a statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 10 million California voters &#8212; including the vast majority of app-based drivers &#8212; passed Prop 22 to protect driver independence, while providing historic new protections,&#8221; Jim Pyatt, an Uber driver who supported Prop 22, said in a statement. &#8220;Voters across the political spectrum spoke loud and clear, passing Prop 22 in a landslide. Meritless lawsuits that seek to undermine the clear democratic will of the people do not stand up to scrutiny in the courts.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The popularity of podcasting and online video shows no signs of slowing down, and so we continue to see a wave of creators publishing a profusion of audio and video content to fill out the airwaves. Today, a company building a platform to make that work easier and more interesting to execute is announcing a round of growth funding to double down on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.descript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Descript</a>, which builds tools that let creators edit audio and video files by using, for example, natural language processing to link the content to the editing of text files, has picked up $30 million in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Andrew Mason, the CEO and founder of the company, said in an interview that the plan will be to use the money to continue building out tools not just for mass-market and individual professional and amateur creators, but also, increasingly, organizations that might be using the tools for their own in-house video and audio needs, a use case that has definitely grown during the last year of global remote working.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We see ourselves&#8230; as an all encompassing platform for all media needs,&#8221; Mason said.</p>
<p>The company had early wins by signing on customers like NPR, Pushkin Industries, VICE, The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as smaller and more modest media outfits.</p>
<p>Mason said that it&#8217;s also now seeing startups and bigger businesses using video for communication also adopting Descript tools, especially in cases where it makes more sense to visualize the answers, but the content could still use the ability to be edited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s externally or internally, for things like bug reporting or personalized introductions or helpdesk videos, we&#8217;re seeing <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">people using Descript for company video,&#8221; he added, &#8220;sometimes in place of something like an email.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Spark Capital, and specifically Nabeel Hyatt (who in a past life co-founded a music games specialist, Conduit Labs, acquired by Zynga), led the round, with Andreessen Horowitz and Redpoint Ventures also participating (both backed Descript in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/descript-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 million Series A</a> in 2019).</p>
<p>A number of individuals &#8212; some investors, and some investors also famous for their own video, podcasting and publishing work &#8212; also participated this Series B, among them Devdatta Akhawe, Alex Blumberg, Jack Conte, Justine Ezarik, Todd Goldberg, Jean-Denis Greze, John Lilly, Tobi Lutke, Bharat Mediratta, Shishir Mehrotra, Casey Neistat, Brian Pokorny, Raghavendra Prabhu, Lenny Rachitsky, Naval Ravikant, Jay Simons, Jake Shapiro, Rahul Vohra, and Ev Williams.</p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of an eventful several months for the company. In October, Descript released its first major update to its editing suite by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/descript-andrew-masons-platform-to-edit-audio-by-editing-text-now-lets-you-edit-video-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanding from audio editing tools to cover video as well</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview last week, Mason said that the feedback so far has been &#8220;excellent&#8221; for the technology, although he is declined to say how many users or usage Descript has had for this or its older audio technology.</p>
<p>Descript&#8217;s move expanding into the newer medium, in any case, makes a lot of sense, when you consider how closely aligned a lot of audio-based podcasting content has been with corresponding videos &#8212; with many<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> of the most popular podcasters often posting videos of their recordings on YouTube and other platforms, for those who prefer to watch as well as listen to recordings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It helps, too, that video is highly monetizable. Podcasting is on track to make more than $1 billion in ad revenues in the U.S. in 2021, according to the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.iab.com/news/u-s-podcast-ad-revenues-near-1-billion-according-to-iab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Meanwhile, even in a year that was considered a downturn, digital video </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/record-digital-ad-revenue-preceded-slowest-quarter-in-a-decade-iab-finds/578781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulled in more than $22 billion</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>That double-platform approach, however, has largely been executed on auto pilot up to now, as Mason points out, describing a lot of the video as &#8220;window dressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We watch a lot of video and podcasts and think about how we can create a tool that makes it fun and easy to craft great content,&#8221; Mason said. &#8220;One thing we’ve observed is that a remarkable amount of video is just audio with window dressing. You don’t notice it until you start looking through that lens. A ton of video is about what is happening with the audio, and so a lot of that video is just filler.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of the editing is no more than a series of jump cuts, he said, and notwithstanding other challenges like bad equipment, it&#8217;s just not a very exciting experience.</p>
<p>That lays the groundwork for Descript not just to create tools to make it easier to edit but in the future to conceive of how to do so in a way that creates a better and potentially more original product at the end of the process, too.</p>
<p>Mason&#8217;s turn to audio-based services for his two past startups &#8212; prior to Descript, he founded and eventually sold (to Bose) an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audio-based city guide service called Detour</a> &#8212; has been something of a left turn for a man probably still better known as the quirky co-founder of the once wildly popular sales platform Groupon.</p>
<p>However, Mason studied music at university and it is more than obvious that audio and sound-based experiences &#8212; not just music but the impact that aural experiences can have &#8212; are really where his passion lies.</p>
<p>Mason is long gone from Groupon, but he remains a bit of a wag. He is quick to quip that his ability to raise money for completely different concepts that are a world away from e-commerce are in no smart part due to his having already won the &#8220;startup lottery&#8221;.</p>
<p>And yes, like many jokes, it&#8217;s a telling and often true term, in my experience and observation. But in this case, I&#8217;d say it undersells some of the really interesting innovations that Descript has built and is building.</p>
<p>More generally audio technology is not only proving to be in demand with customers, but (as it happens) it is also being sought out larger tech companies, including (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-podcast-network-wondery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently</a>) Amazon, Spotify, Apple, Google and Facebook, which are picking up a lot of smaller audio startups in their own efforts to build out their bigger media business.</p>
<p>And this at the heart of why Descript has attracted this latest round of investment.</p>
<div>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been convinced of machine learning&#8217;s power to be used as a creative tool for some time,&#8221; Hyatt at Spark noted to me. &#8220;Descript is perhaps the best example of that in a startup today. The company takes some very complicated technology, but presents it in a way that&#8217;s actually easier to use than the status quo products. It&#8217;s very rare that you come across a company that uses technology to both empower a creative professional to work ten times faster, and simultaneously makes the creative process ten times easier for an amateur, growing the addressable market. Anyone editing audio or video, which is most of us nowadays, can see the benefits.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a>, a new service that makes managing AWS resources and their associated spend easier, is coming out of stealth today. The service offers its users an alternative to the complex AWS console with <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/features">support</a> for most of the standard AWS services, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, ECS and Fargate and Route 53 hosted zones.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder, Ben Schaechter, previously worked at AWS and Digital Ocean (and before that, he worked on Crunchbase, too). Yet while DigitalOcean showed him how to build a developer experience for individuals and small businesses, he argues that the underlying services and hardware simply weren&#8217;t as robust as those of the hyperclouds. AWS, on the other hand, offers everything a developer could want (and likely more), but the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea was really born out of &#8216;what if we could take the user experience of DigitalOcean and apply it to the three public cloud providers, AWS, GCP and Azure,&#8221; Schaechter told me. &#8220;We decided to start just with AWS because the experience there is the roughest and it&#8217;s the largest player in the market. And I really think that we can provide a lot of value there before we do GCP and Azure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus for Vantage is on the developer experience and cost transparency. Schaechter noted that some of its users describe it as being akin to a &#8220;Mint for AWS.&#8221; To get started, you give Vantage a set of read permissions to your AWS services and the tool will automatically profile everything in your account. The service refreshes this list once per hour, but users can also refresh their lists manually.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLYCGFduuv0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s often hard enough to know which AWS services you are actually using, that alone is a useful feature. &#8220;That&#8217;s the number one use case,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What are we paying for and what do we have?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the core of Vantage is what the team calls &#8220;views,&#8221; which allows you to see which resources you are using. What is interesting here is that this is quite a flexible system and allows you to build custom views to see which resources you are using for a given application across regions, for example. Those may include Lambda, storage buckets, your subnet, code pipeline and more.</p>
<p>On the cost-tracking side, Vantage currently only offers point-in-time costs, but Schaechter tells me that the team plans to add historical trends as well to give users a better view of their cloud spend.</p>
<p>Schaechter and his co-founder bootstrapped the company and he noted that before he wants to raise any money for the service, he wants to see people paying for it. Currently, Vantage offers a free plan, as well as paid &#8220;pro&#8221; and &#8220;business&#8221; plans with additional functionality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/eden/">Eden</a>, the office management platform that has raised nearly $70 million since inception, is today making a tweak to its nomenclature to reflect its push into SaaS tools. Henceforth, the startup will be called Eden Workplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of clients in different categories like retail, some industrial and some classic real estate and we wanted to reaffirm that we&#8217;re really building software and a service marketplace for the modern office,&#8221; said cofounder and CEO Joe Du Bey. &#8220;We also felt that the company is fundamentally different because of all the SaaS tools that we&#8217;re building, so it acknowledges that there&#8217;s a change in our business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eden also acquired the rights to <a href="https://www.edenworkplace.com/">edenworkplace.com</a>, which Du Bey believes will lend more credibility to the brand who is looking to sell into corporations and organizations and IT departments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095237" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095237" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="240" class="size-large wp-image-2095237" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png 3153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=300,106 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=768,271 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=680,240 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=1536,541 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=2048,722 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Eden_Logo_Workplace-3.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eden</p></div></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first evolution for the office management startup.</p>
<p>Eden started out as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/eden-raises-2-million-to-expand-on-demand-tech-help-service/">service to help folks troubleshoot tech issues using on-demand specialists</a>. Over time, the company moved into office management services, such as cleanings, repairs, re-stocking, IT help and more. The vertically integrated startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/eden-raises-10-million-series-a-to-build-out-its-office-management-marketplace/">turned into a marketplace</a>, working with multiple vendors to provide services to clients.</p>
<p>In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Eden has had to shift yet again, introducing SaaS products to help people return to and work in their office spaces. That includes the ability to offer COVID-safety questionnaires, track the people coming in and out of the office, alongside tools for visitor management and room booking.</p>

<p>Eden is also introducing a desk reservation system for workers to ensure they can maintain social distancing. This feature was teased at the time of the SaaS launch but is available now to new and existing customers.</p>
<p>Thus far, Eden&#8217;s SaaS tools have been growing revenue by more than 100 percent month over month, and Du Bey believes the SaaS side of the business will grow 5x by the end of 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.capchase.com">Capchase</a> is one of this new crop of startup-focused fintech companies. It allows startups to receive their future recurring revenue today in the form of debt, allowing founders to spend future money earlier and potentially avoid at least some of those expensive, dilutive rounds of venture capital, particularly when they are just getting started. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/">I profiled the Boston-based company a few months ago</a>, when they had raised a $4.6 million seed led by Caffeinated Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zDLxoI9tI2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/">Capchase raises $4.6M to deliver fast cash to SaaS companies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Capchase raises $4.6M to deliver fast cash to SaaS companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/embed/#?secret=zDLxoI9tI2" data-secret="zDLxoI9tI2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, the company is swimming in new funds, and it’s ready to start lending out to even more startups. This morning, the company announced that it has raised $60 million in an “asset-backed credit facility” from i80 Group. That should allow Capchase to expand the number of startups it works with, as well as the amount of revenue prepayment it could potentially extend to each startup as well.</p>
<p>i80 itself has built an investment firm based around credit underwriting just these sorts of projects for startups. In addition to this facility for Capchase and similar fintech underwriting, the group also backs real estate underwriting projects like for Properly, <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canadian-real-estate-innovator-properly-announces-100m-financing-from-silicon-valley-bank-and-i80-group-850318563.html">where it co-led a $100 million facility with Silicon Valley Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Capchase, which was founded in early 2020, claims that its initial customers have delayed fundraises by an average of 8 months and saved about 16% in overall dilution. Of course, those number will vary widely depending on the startup, its growth, its recurring revenues and other variables.</p>
<p>Capchase’s goal isn’t just to extend revenue prepayment to startups, but to do it fast, sometimes in just days or even hours depending on the complexity of the recurring revenues of its clients. With $60 million more, it’s hungry to lend even faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lenovo keeps rolling out unique takes on familiar categories this year at CES. Last week it was the screen-swiveling all-in-one and some AR glasses, and today (the first official day of the show), the company’s got an interesting update to last year’s dual-display ThinkBook Plus.</p>
<p>Like the original, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 i sports an e-ink display on the lid. Lenovo’s been experimenting with the technology for a number of form factors, and this one makes more sense than previous shots &#8212; essentially offering up a quick-glance notification center. I suppose you could also use it as an e-reader if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>Ultimately, like a lot of what Lenovo does, it’s perhaps more interesting than honestly useful. Though, as ever, points for trying something new. This time out the screen is significantly larger, at about the same size as the primary screen. It now measures 12 inches and sports a 2560 x 1600 resolution (also matching the main screen). The refresh rate has been enhanced, and now it’s possible to run some of the apps on the lid without opening it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xTUqpetO6V"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/lenovo-launches-ar-glasses-for-enterprise/">Lenovo launches AR glasses for enterprise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lenovo launches AR glasses for enterprise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/lenovo-launches-ar-glasses-for-enterprise/embed/#?secret=xTUqpetO6V" data-secret="xTUqpetO6V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The laptop also sports a built-in stylus for use with the touchscreen. Also interesting is the arrival of the new ThinkBook Charging Mat, which uses Energysquare’s Power by Contact to power the battery. The battery itself gets 15 hours on a charge, or 24 if just using the e-ink screen. I suspect charging it up using just the pad is a fairly time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Dell notably introduced its own take on the category back at CES 2017. The technology, of course, hasn’t gained much traction in the intervening years.</p>
<p>ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 i arrives this quarter, starting at $1,549. No word on the pricing for the mat accessory.</p>

<p>The free plan for Grafana Cloud has some limitations, but it includes access to virtually all of Grafana Labs&#8217; tools for monitoring modern applications. In addition, Grafana&#8217;s paid Pro plan for its hosted service is also getting an update and will now include access to five times more metrics per month.</p>
<p>With the free plan, users get a 14-day retention period for metrics and logs, access for up to three team members, 50 GB of log storage and up to 10,000 series for Prometheus and Graphite metrics. For Pro plans, those numbers increase to 15,000 series, 13 months of retention for metrics (up from 3,000 previously) and 100 GB of logs with a one-month retention period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Offering a hosted service is par for the course for open-source companies. For most of them, after all, this is the most obvious way to monetize their tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The origin story of Grafana Cloud is one of open source,&#8221; the company writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Just like the development of our features, Grafana Cloud was first born from the pains and needs of our open source community. We were looking to give users a quick way to get Grafana up and running. It was a product created out of necessity, and it made sense at the time because it’s what our customers wanted back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its open-source origins, the team decided that it made sense to also offer a free plan. In addition, though, adding a free plan will also make it easier for new users to get started  &#8212; and maybe become paying users over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are more than seven years into the notion of modern containerization, and it still requires a complex set of tools and a high level of knowledge on how containers work. The <a href="https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim">DockerSlim open source project</a> developed several years ago from a desire to remove some of that complexity for developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://Slim.ai">Slim.ai</a>, a new startup that wants to build a commercial product on top of the open source project, announced a $6.6 million seed round today from Boldstart Ventures, Decibel Partners, FXP Ventures and TechAviv Founder Partners.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO John Amaral says he and fellow co-founder and CTO Kyle Quest have worked together for years, but it was Quest who started and nurtured DockerSlim. &#8220;We started coming together around a project that Kyle built called DockerSlim. He&#8217;s the primary author, inventor and up until we started doing this company, the sole proprietor of that of that community,&#8221; Amaral explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time Quest built DockerSlim in 2015, he was working with Docker containers and he wanted a way to automate some of the lower level tasks involved in dealing with them. &#8220;I wanted to solve my own pain points and problems that I had to deal with, and my team had to deal with dealing with containers. Containers were an exciting new technology, but there was a lot of domain knowledge you needed to build production-grade applications and not everybody had that kind of domain expertise on the team, which is pretty common in almost every team,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He originally built the tool to optimize container images, but he began looking at other aspects of the DevOps lifecycle including the author, build, deploy and run phases. He found as he looked at that, he saw the possibility of building a commercial company on top of the open source project.</p>
<p>Quest says that while the open source project is a starting point, he and Amaral see a lot of areas to expand. &#8220;You need to integrate it into your developer workflow and then you have different systems you deal with, different container registries, different cloud environments and all of that. [&#8230;] You need a solution that can address those needs and doing that through an open source tool is challenging, and that&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to provide premium value and have a commercial product offering,&#8221; Quest explained.</p>
<p>Ed Sim, founder and general partner at Boldstart Ventures, one of the seed investors sees a company bringing innovation to an area of technology where it has been lacking, while putting some more control in the hands of developers. &#8220;Slim can shift that all left and give developers the power through the Slim tools to answer all those questions, and then, boom, they can develop containers, push them into production and then DevOps can do their thing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They are just 15 people right now including the founders, but Amaral says building a diverse and inclusive company is important to him, and that&#8217;s why one of his early hires was head of culture. &#8220;One of the first two or three people we brought into the company was our head of culture. We actually have that role in our company now, and she is a rock star and a highly competent and focused person on building a great culture. Culture and diversity to me are two sides of the same coin,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is still in the very early stages of developing that product. In the meantime, they continue to nurture the open source project and to build a community around that. They hope to use that as a springboard to build interest in the commercial product, which should be available some time later this year.</p>
