										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/voyager-space-holdings" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="voyager-space-holdings">Voyager Space Holdings <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to build up its portfolio of strategic space service offerings with the acquisition of a majority stake in X.O. Markets, the parent company of Nanoracks. Nanoracks has provided commercial space services for years now, and most recently provided the Bishop Airlock that was installed on the International Space Station. Bishop is the first dedicated commercial permanent airlock on the ISS, and will provide a major increase in capabilities in terms of providing access to the orbital platform for private small satellites and research.</p>
<p>This is Voyager&#8217;s third major acquisition this year, after it picked up a majority stake in The Launch Company, a launch support company that provides services and hardware to facilitate launches, and that works with companies including Relativity, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/firefly-aerospace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="firefly-aerospace">Firefly Aerospace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Virgin Orbit. Voyager also picked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/more-new-space-consolidation-as-voyager-space-holdings-acquires-pioneer-astronautics/">Pioneer Astronautics</a> (an R&amp;D company that works on propulsion, fuels, rapid prototyping and much more) in 2020, as well as Altius Space Machines in 2019. Altius is a startup that works on technology for on-orbit satellite servicing.</p>

<p>Nanoracks is probably its highest-profile acquisition, since the company has been involved in over 1,000 ISS projects, spanning on-station research and small satellite launch from the platform, as well as other orbital and deep space missions. Nanoracks created a commercial space testing platform outside o the ISS, and will be demonstrating a technology on a SpaceX mission next year that could eventually be used to convert spent upper stages from launch vehicles into orbital commercial mini space stations.</p>

<p>Voyager Space Holdings continues its strategic acquisition of new space companies, building out a portfolio that can offer clients significantly more &#8216;full-service&#8217; solutions than any of these individual companies taken together. Commercial details of these arrangements aren&#8217;t shared, but they increasingly represent one path to exit for smaller companies addressing elements of the larger commercial space sector in fairly specialized ways.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The undoing of Nikola continues. Today, the company announced the termination of its contract with Republic Services for 2,500 garbage trucks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">undoing</a> of Nikola continues. Today, the company announced the termination of its contract with Republic Services for 2,500 garbage trucks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/nikola-stock-surges-on-order-for-2500-electric-garbage-trucks/">Announced back in August</a>, the deal had Nikola building garbage trucks in 2023 with on-road testing scheduled for 2024. This is the latest deal to unravel for Nikola as it tries to patch up following devastating reports.</p>
<p>According to Nikola, the separation of the two companies was mutual though it&#8217;s hard to picture Nikola&#8217;s SEC troubles didn&#8217;t weigh heavily upon Republic Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the right decision for both companies given the resources and investments required,&#8221; said Nikola CEO Mark Russell said in a released statement. &#8220;We support and respect Republic Services&#8217; commitment to achieving environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions for their customers. Nikola remains laser-focused on delivering on our battery-electric and fuel-cell electric commercial truck programs, and the energy infrastructure to support them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>News of this deal is sending Nikola&#8217;s stock down 10% in pre-market trading. If this level holds upon the stock market&#8217;s open, Nikola will be trading at its lowest levels following it&#8217;s monumental rise over the summer months.</p>
<p>The deal with Republic Services was originally a victory banner for the once-high flying electric vehicle startup. Signaled as mainstream acceptance of the company, Republic Services&#8217; contract came before a mega $2 billion investment from General Motors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/nikla-shares-drop-as-gm-pulls-plug-on-investment-deal/">That deal is also cancelled</a> following several key revelations about the company that lead to an SEC investigation and the company&#8217;s chairman stepping down.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nikola says deliveries will begin of Nikola Tre battery-electric semi-trucks in the US in 2021 and the company expects to break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in 2021, too. And then in 2023, the company expects to produce its fuel-cell-electric semi-trucks at Nikola’s Coolidge, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we examine any year in enterprise M&amp;A, it&#8217;s tempting to highlight the biggest, gaudiest deals &#8212; and there were plenty of those in 2020. I&#8217;ve written about 34 acquisitions so far this year. Of those, 15 were worth $1 billion or more, 12 were small enough to not require that the companies disclose the price and the remainder fell somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Four deals involving chip companies coming together totaled over $100 billion on their own. While nobody does eye-popping M&amp;A quite like the chip industry, other sectors also offered their own eyebrow-raising deals, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buying Slack</a> earlier this month for $27.7 billion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We are likely to see more industries consolidate the way chips did in 2020, albeit probably not quite as dramatically or expensively.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet in spite of the drama of these larger numbers, the most interesting targets to me were the pandemic-driven smaller deals that started popping up in May. Those small acquisitions are the ones that are so insignificant that the company doesn&#8217;t have to share the purchase price publicly. They usually involve early-stage companies being absorbed by cash-rich concerns looking for some combination of missing technology or engineering talent in a particular area like security or artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It was certainly an active year in M&amp;A, and we still might not have seen the last of it. Let&#8217;s have a look at why those minor deals were so interesting and how they compared with larger ones, while looking ahead to what 2021 M&amp;A might look like.</p>
<h2>Early-stage blues</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s always hard to know exactly why an early-stage startup would give up its independence by selling to a larger entity, but we can certainly speculate on some of the reasons why this year&#8217;s rapid-fire dealing started in May. While we can never know for certain why these companies decided to exit via acquisition, we know that in April, the pandemic hit full force in the United States and the economy began to shut down.</p>
<p>Some startups were particularly vulnerable, especially companies low on cash in the April timeframe. Obviously companies fail when they run out of funding, and we started seeing early-stage startups being scooped up the following month.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know for sure of course if there is a direct correlation between April&#8217;s economic woes and the flurry of deals that started in May, but we can reasonably speculate that there was. For some percentage of them, I&#8217;m guessing it was a fire sale or at least a deal made under less than ideal terms. For others, maybe they simply didn&#8217;t have the wherewithal to keep going under such adverse economic conditions or the partnerships were just too good to pass up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that I didn&#8217;t cover any deals in April. But, beginning on May 7, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-to-get-end-to-end-encryption-expertise/">Zoom bought Keybase</a> for its encryption expertise; five days later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/atlassian-acquires-halp-to-bring-slack-integration-to-the-forefront/">Atlassian bought Halp</a> for Slack integration; and the day after that VMware bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">cloud native security startup Octarine</a> &#8212; and we were off and running. Granted the big companies benefited from making these acquisitions, but the timing stood out.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the turning of the New Year, many people are wishing they could do something about the environment. Now, a UK startup hopes to make our environmental impact more personal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yayzy.com/">Yayzy</a> has now launched an iOS app (but Android is coming) which literally links to your bank account to work out the environmental impact of what you buy. It uses payment data via Open Banking standards to automatically calculate the carbon footprint of each purchase a user makes, giving them a picture of their total monthly carbon emissions. This makes the carbon footprint calculated more accurate and bespoke to the individual, allowing them to immediately connect their spending to its impact on the planet.</p>
<p>Yayzy has secured £900,000 in backing from Antler Venture Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/seedrs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="seedrs">Seedrs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (a crowdfunding round) and the CoreAngels Impact Fund. As the user sees what the carbon footprint is of their purchase, they can choose to offset it right then and there on the app via the carbon offsetter <a href="https://ecosphere.plus/">Ecosphere Plus</a>.  In the app, users can also find tips to reduce their carbon footprint, eco-friendly retailers near them or insights into lifestyle choices that have the highest environmental impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their competitors are people like <a href="https://cogo.co/">CoGo</a>, a real-time Carbon Footprint tracker, and and <a href="https://doconomy.com/">Doconomy</a> and the soon to launch <a href="https://www.tred.earth/">Tred</a>.</p>
<p>But Yayzy is taking a different approach. It brings together all of a user’s spending and shows them item by item as they spend, what the carbon footprint of that spend is. So far &#8211; it claims &#8211; its competitors don’t do that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090442" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090442" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png" alt="" width="567" height="402" class="size-full wp-image-2090442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png 567w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090442" class="wp-caption-text">Yaysy app</p></div></p>
<p>This can be done ad hoc, item by item, or by signing up to a monthly subscription to either carbon offsetting projects or the user&#8217;s own unique climate portfolio. This portfolio would bundle multiple projects together for a more &#8216;holistic&#8217; impact. Yayzy says all of these projects have been carefully selected based on strict criteria, and also advance the UN Sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>For its underlying carbon data, Yayzy is using Vital Metrics  https://www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/<br />
as used by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft and both the UK and US governments, among others.</p>
<p>Mankaran Ahluwalia, cofounder and CEO of Yayzy said in a statement: &#8220;While emissions have gradually risen as lockdown eases, YAYZY wants to put us all in the driver’s seat to control our own environmental impact… It is clear from a plethora of surveys that the majority of people want to address climate change before it is too late, but that a huge intention/action gap blocks much of it. Our solution  with Yayzy is to make environmental impact ‘up close and personal’ and the action to tackle it super easy, all via your phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahluwalia, was as a technology analyst with Infosys and built a lending platform for alternate credit. Cofounder Cristian Dan, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cto" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cto">CTO, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> previously built a discounts platform and cofounder Pedro Cabrero, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cfo-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cfo-com">CFO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was in equity sales and trading for UBS and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/citigroup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="citigroup">Citigroup, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and co-founded the a leading online pharmacy in Mexico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> TikTok&#8217;s Chinese parent company, is entering the health industry as it seeks to diversify a business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/bytedance-valuation-under-huge-pressure-as-tiktok-sale-nears/">dependent on advertising and livestreaming sales</a>. The company, which prides itself on content algorithms, has started seeking talent in AI drug discovery across Mountain View, Shanghai and Beijing, its recruiting page <a href="https://jobs.bytedance.com/en/position?keywords=drug&amp;category=&amp;location=&amp;project=&amp;type=&amp;job_hot_flag=&amp;current=1&amp;limit=10">shows</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking for candidates to join our team and conduct cutting-edge research in drug discovery and manufacturing powered by AI algorithms,&#8221; one of the job postings said.</p>
<p>The drug discovery team, which is looking to fill at least five roles including interns, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6731781114626682880/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6725103577200693248%2C6731780990580137984%29">falls under</a> the <a href="https://ailab.bytedance.com/">ByteDance AI Lab</a>. The AI-focused research and development arm was first established in 2016 to serve ByteDance&#8217;s content services like TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version Douyin, but it&#8217;s unsurprising to see the lab extending its reach to pharmaceuticals, which can similarly benefit from the machine learning technologies that power short video feeds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Given the number of research fields in AI, the applications of these new technologies can be found across every segment of our product portfolio,&#8221; said a description on the ByteDance AI Lab <a href="https://ailab.bytedance.com/">website</a>.</p>
<p>All five drug discovery research positions require a PhD degree in relevant disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics, computational biology and computational chemistry. Candidates will be working on drug development such as design, identification and simulation, according to the postings.</p>
<p>ByteDance cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Other Chinese tech behemoths have made similar moves into the health space. Tencent&#8217;s own AI-powered drug team, also under the firm&#8217;s AI Lab, has been actively publishing findings since at least<a href="https://drug.ai.tencent.com/en/paper/1"> August 2019</a>. Baidu planned to raise $2 billion for a new biotech startup focusing on drug discovery and AI-powered diagnosis, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-baidu-biotech-exclusive/exclusive-baidu-investors-in-talks-to-raise-2-billion-for-biotech-startup-source-idUSKBN2600UH">reported</a> in September. Huawei has also made endeavors in drug discovery as well as medical imaging through its cloud computing unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant messaging app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/telegram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="telegram">Telegram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is &#8220;approaching&#8221; 500 million users and plans to generate revenue starting next year to keep the business afloat, its founder Pavel Durov said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Durov said he has personally bankrolled the seven-year-old business so far, but as the startup scales he is looking for ways to monetize the instant messaging service. &#8220;A project of our size needs at least a few hundred million dollars per year to keep going,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/telegram-hits-400-million-monthly-active-users/">topped 400 million active users in April this year</a>, will introduce its own ad platform for public one-to-many channels &#8212; “one that is user-friendly, respects privacy and allows us to cover the costs of server and traffic,” he wrote on his Telegram channel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If we monetize large public one-to-many channels via the Ad Platform, the owners of these channels will receive free traffic in proportion to their size,&#8221; he wrote. Another way Telegram could monetize its service is through premium stickers with &#8220;additional expressive features,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The artists who make stickers of this new type will also get a part of the profit. We want millions of Telegram-based creators and small businesses to thrive, enriching the experience of all our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some analysts were hoping that Telegram would be able to monetize the platform through its blockchain token project. But after several delays and regulatory troubles, Telegram said in May that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/telegram-abandons-its-ton-blockchain-platform/">decided to abandon the project</a>.</p>
<p>For this project, Dubai-based Telegram had raised $1.7 billion from investors in 2018. It had planned to distribute its token, called grams, after developing the blockchain software. Telegram offered to return $1.2 billion to investors earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telegram has a social networking dimension. Our massive public one-to-many channels can have millions of subscribers each and are more like Twitter feeds. In many markets the owners of such channels display ads to earn money, sometimes using third-party ad platforms. The ads they post look like regular messages, and are often intrusive. We will fix this by introducing our own Ad Platform for public one-to-many channels,&#8221; Durov wrote today.</p>
<p>All existing features will remain free, said Durov, who is one of the biggest critics of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp, adding <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that Telegram is committed to not introduce ads in private one-to-one chats or group chats because they are a “bad idea.”</p>
<p>“We are not going to sell the company like the founders of WhatsApp. The world needs Telegram to stay independent as a place where users are respected and high-quality service is ensured,” he wrote. “Telegram will begin to generate revenue, starting next year. We will do it in accordance with our values and the pledges we have made over the last 7 years. Thanks to our current scale, we will be able to do it in a non-intrusive way. Most users will hardly notice any change.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Telegram also introduced a new group voice chats feature to the app. The new voice chats feature, which is similar to Discord&#8217;s always-on room, supports a few thousand participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve heard of challenger banks? Now meet the challenger energy suppliers. The UK’s Octopus Energy has attained a $2.06 billion valuation (£1.5 billion) after attracting a $200 million (£150 million) investment from Tokyo Gas for a 9.7% stake, in order to launch a joint venture. Octopus will own 30% of the venture, with Tokyo Gas owning the majority. After five years of operation, Octopus is now close to the valuation of British Gas owner Centrica.</p>
<p>Octopus will now launch as a brand in Japan with its trademark 100% renewable electricity operation which uses an innovative AI and data-based platform to balance loads around the grid. Its Kraken software is also licensed to Origin Energy, nPower and E.On, Good Energy and Hanwha Corporation, among others, reaching 17 million energy accounts worldwide.</p>
<p>“This joint venture will bring our exciting approach to renewable energy and technology to the world’s largest competitive energy market, and the investment will turbocharge our mission to revolutionize energy globally,” said chief executive Greg Jackson in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Australia’s Origin Energy is also set to take a stake in Octopus for 50 million dollars (£37 million) following a larger investment in April when Origin bought a 20% stake.</p>
<p>Octopus says it is aiming for 100 million customers around the world by 2027, and recently launched in the US, Australia, Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the UK, Octopus has a 5% share of the energy supply market and counts 1.8 million households in its retail portfolio, according to the company.</p>
<p>Tokyo Gas president Takashi Uchida said: “Through this partnership, we will contribute to the achievement of a better lifestyle for customers by realizing value creation and delivery tailored to every one of them.”</p>
<p>Japanese renewables lag the UK by 50% (renewables in Japan in 2019 accounted for 18.9% of electricity vs 37.9% in the UK) so the potential for growth is significant. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has set a target of reaching net-zero by 2050.</p>
<p>In the UK Octopus has also launched Electric Juice, an electric vehicle roaming network, and partnered with Tesla to launch Tesla Power.</p>

The round was led by Sequoia Capital China, with participation from Hillhouse Capital and Shunwei Capital. All three are returning investors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/easyvan/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, this brings Lalamove’s total raised so far to about $976.5 million. The company’s last funding announcement was in February 2019, when it hit unicorn status with a Series D of $300 million.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/hong-kong-s-lalamove-said-to-seek-funds-at-8-billion-valuation">reported last week</a> that Lalamove was seeking at least $500 million in new funding at $8 billion valuation, or four times what it raised at least year.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 for on-demand deliveries within the same city, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/easyvan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="easyvan">Lalamove <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has since grown its business to include freight services, enterprise logistics, moving and vehicle rental. In addition to 352 cities in mainland China, Lalamove also operates in Hong Kong (where it launched), Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/lalamove-enters-the-us/">entered the United States</a> for the first time in October, and currently claims about 480,000 monthly active drivers and 7.2 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>Part of its Series D had been earmarked to expand into India, but Lalamove was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">among 43 apps </a>that were banned by the government, citing cybersecurity concerns.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Lalamove CEO Shing Chow said its Series E will be used to enter more fourth- and fifth-tier Chinese cities, adding &#8220;we believe the mobile internet’s transformation of China’s logistics industry is far from over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies that have recently raised significant funding rounds for their logistics operations in China include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/manbang-1-7-billion-funding/">Manbang</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/alibaba-6-6-billion-investment-yto/">YTO</a>.</p>
<p>Lalamove’s (known in Chinese as Huolala) Series E announcement said the company experienced a 93% drop in shipment volume at the beginning of the year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has experienced a strong rebound, with order volume up 82% year-over-year even before Double 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WeRide, one of China’s most-funded startups developing autonomous driving capabilities, said on Wednesday that it has raised a $200 million strategic round from Chinese<a href="https://en.yutong.com/"> bus maker Yutong</a>.</p>
<p>Mega investments aren’t uncommon at companies like WeRide developing the next-generation level 4 driving standard, which denotes that the car can handle the majority of driving situations independently without human intervention.</p>
<p>WeRide did not disclose its valuation for this round, which is the first tranche of its Series B round, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will see WeRide joining hands with Yutong, a 57-year-old company, to make autonomous driving minibusses and city buses as well as work on R&amp;D, vehicle platforms and mobility services together. The partners have already jointly developed a front-loaded driverless minibus for mass-production. The model, which comes without a steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, is designed for operating in urban open roads, said WeRide</p>
<p>Alliance Ventures, the strategic venture capital arm of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, became WeRide&#8217;s strategic investor<a href="https://www.weride.ai/series-a/"> in 2018</a> following the completion of the startup&#8217;s Series A round, which was partially funded by the Chinese facial recognition giant SenseTime.</p>
<p>Autonomous driving startups in China are racing to showcase their progress, in part to attract funding for their cash-bleeding businesses. Alibaba-backed AutoX, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">began deploying driverless cars</a> on the roads in Shenzhen in a bold move. WeRide and its rivals are testing various levels of autonomous driving vehicles in both the United States and major Chinese cities where local policies are supporting the futurist transportation tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital&#8217;s attitude is shifting and increasingly bullish about autonomous driving and its commercial future following the COVID-19 pandemic [in China]. Many investments are happening in this space because investors don&#8217;t want to miss out on any potential leaders in autonomous driving,&#8221; the WeRide spokesperson said. &#8220;Our Series B round has attracted a lot of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeRide’s competitors include Pony.ai in its backyard Guangzhou, AutoX and Deeproute.ai in Shenzhen, Momenta in Suzhou, Baidu in Beijing, to name a few.</p>

<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ikea-systems" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ikea-systems">IKEA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned online marketplace for on-demand labor said it reset user passwords out of an abundance of caution and that it &#8220;took steps to prevent access to any user accounts,&#8221; a TaskRabbit spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company later confirmed it was a credential stuffing attack, where existing sets of exposed or breached usernames and passwords are matched against different websites to access accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We acted in an abundance of caution and reset passwords for many TaskRabbit accounts, including all users who had not logged in since May 1, 2020, as well as all users who logged in during the time period of the attack, even though most of the latter activity was attributable to users’ regular use of our services,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As always, the safety and security of the TaskRabbit community is our priority, and we will continue to be vigilant about protecting our users’ personal information,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>TaskRabbit customers were alerted to the incident in a vague email that only noted their password had been recently changed &#8220;as a security precaution,&#8221; without saying what specifically prompted the account change. TechCrunch confirmed that the email was legitimate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to reset passwords after a security incident where customer or account information is accessed or stolen in a breach.</p>
<p>Last year, online apparel marketplace StockX reset customer passwords after initially citing &#8220;system updates,&#8221; but later admitted it took action after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/stockx-security-concerns-reset-passwords/">found suspicious activity</a> on its network. Days later, a hacker provided TechCrunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/03/stockx-hacked-millions-records/">6.8 million StockX account records</a> stolen from the company&#8217;s servers.</p>

<p>TaskRabbit&#8217;s freelance labor marketplace was founded in 2008, and grew over time from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/taskrabbit-debuts-revamped-platform-launches-new-website-and-mobile-apps/">an auction-style platform</a> for negotiating tasks and errands to a more mature and tailored marketplace to match customers with contractors. That eventually attracted the attention of furniture retailer IKEA, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/ikea-buys-taskrabbit/">bought the startup in September 2017</a> after TaskRabbit put itself on the market for a strategic buyer.</p>
<p>The year after the acquisition, however, TaskRabbit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/taskrabbits-app-is-offline-while-it-investigates-a-cybersecurity-incident/">had to take its website and app down</a> due to a &#8220;cybersecurity incident.&#8221; The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/taskrabbit-ceo-posts-statement-as-its-app-returns-following-a-cybersecurity-breach/">later revealed</a> an attacker had gained unauthorized access to its systems. Then-TaskRabbit CEO Stacy Brown-Philpot said the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/taskrabbit-ceo-posts-statement-as-its-app-returns-following-a-cybersecurity-breach/">contracted with an outside forensics team</a> to identify what customer information had been compromised by the attack, and urged both users and providers to stay vigilant in monitoring their own accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Following the attack, the company said it was implementing several new security measures and would work on making the log-in process more secure. It also said it would reduce the amount of data retained about taskers and customers as well as &#8220;enhance overall network cyber threat detection technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown-Philpot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/stacy-brown-philpot-is-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-taskrabbit/">left TaskRabbit earlier this year</a>, and the CEO role has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ania-smith-named-chief-executive-officer-at-taskrabbit-301110433.html">since been filled by</a> former Airbnb and Uber Eats leader, Ania Smith.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Stimulus bill increases penalties for illegal streaming services</strong></p>
<p>While we wrote several stories yesterday about the tech implications of the new stimulus bill (and highlighted it in yesterday&#8217;s Daily Crunch), more details are emerging — like the fact that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stimulus-bill-streaming/">make illegal streaming for profit a felony</a>, punishable by fines or up to 10 years of imprisonment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The language of the bill seems to focus on commercial piracy services, rather than individuals or Twitch streamers — a point that one of its sponsors, Senator Thom Tillis, emphasized in a statement, claiming that &#8220;no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the copyright front, the bill also creates a new Copyright Claims Board to handle copyright infringement claims of up to $30,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content moderation has been a thorny topic in 2020. And when I say “thorny,” I mean in the sense of having multiple congressional hearings on the subject. Twitter and Facebook in particular have been mired in concerns around the subject, fielding complaints that they both haven’t done enough to weed out problematic content and suggestions that they’re a censorship-happy, shadow-banning enemy of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The latter appears to be the sole reason for the existence of the right wing-focused Twitter competitor, Parler.</p>
<p>As <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/substack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="substack">Substack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> grows in popularity, the newsletter platform is going to face some tremendously difficult questions around content moderation. Today<a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"> it published a lengthy blog post</a> hoping to nip some of those concerns in the bud. The write-up offers some caveats, but largely espouses the platform’s commitment to free speech, noting:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>In most cases, we don’t think that censoring content is helpful, and in fact it often backfires. Heavy-handed censorship can draw more attention to content than it otherwise would have enjoyed, and at the same time it can give the content creators a martyr complex that they can trade off for future gain. We prefer a contest of ideas. We believe dissent and debate is important. We celebrate nonconformity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The stance reflects Substack’s commitment to a subscription-based model, rather than the ads that currently keep the lights on for services like Twitter and Facebook. Instead, it takes a 10% cut of writers’ subscription revenue. Certainly that frees it up from sponsorship boycotts to some degree. The subscription model also means that users have to opt into specific content more so than on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where content boundaries are far more fluid.</p>
<p>“We are happy to compete with ‘Substack but with more controls on speech’ just as we are happy to compete with ‘Substack but with advertising,’ ” the company writes.</p>
<p>Of course, there are financial considerations &#8212; there always are. Substack has a vested interest in supporting right-wing and conservative voices who have decried Facebook and Twitter’s practices. Notably, The Dispatch is at the top of the service’s politics leaderboard. In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year, editor Stephen Hayes called the service, “unapologetically center-right,” while its current blurb refers to it as “conservative.”</p>
<p>“None of these views are neutral,” Substack writes. “Many Silicon Valley technology companies strive to make their platforms apolitical, but we think such a goal is impossible to achieve.” There’s no doubt some truth in that. Any position on content moderation can be viewed as a political one to some degree. And equally, none will make everyone &#8212; or even most people &#8212; completely happy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also easy to see the service facing some major tests of its current hands-off approach as the service continues to grow in popularity. The service’s approach has involved putting its name out there in front of consumers, meaning it won’t be viewed as a kind of invisible publishing platform.</p>
<p>Substack is quick to add that there is, naturally, content that crosses the line in spite of this. “Of course, there are limits,” it writes. “We do not allow porn on Substack, for example, or spam. We do not allow doxxing or harassment.”</p>

<p>Reacting to Reuters&#8217; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">recent news</a> that Apple has not abandoned its electric car program and is still pursuing plans to build a physical vehicle, Musk tweeted that in &#8220;the darkest days&#8221; of scaling Model 3 production, he reached out to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Tim Cook and raised the possibility of the Cupertino company acquiring Tesla. Musk says that Cook refused to take the meeting.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elon-musk">Elon Musk <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk&#8217;s short tweet did not clarify exactly when this timeline was, though given public information about Tesla&#8217;s Model 3 production, it was likely between 2017 and 2019. In regards to Musk&#8217;s proposed sales price, 1/10th of Tesla&#8217;s current market capitalization is about $60 billion, which isn&#8217;t too far from the stock&#8217;s public value last year before it reached stratospheric heights in recent months.</p>
<p>Though Tesla is now worth more than $600 billion on the public markets after joining the S&amp;P 500 this week, most Wall Street analysts seem perplexed by the stock&#8217;s recent growth, which has been owed to young and first-time investors rallying behind Tesla&#8217;s products and its CEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.banditml.com">Bandit ML</a> aims to optimize and automate the process of presenting the right offer to the right customer.</p>
<p>The startup was part of the summer 2020 class at accelerator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It also raised a $1.32 million seed round in September from YC, Haystack Fund, Webb Investment Network, Liquid 2 Ventures, Jigsaw Ventures, Basecamp Fund, Pathbreaker Ventures and various angels — including what CEO Edoardo Conti said are 10 current and former Uber employees.</p>
<p>Conti (who founded the company with Lionel Vital and Joseph Gilley) is a former Uber software engineer and researcher himself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea, as he explained via email, is that one customer might be more excited about a $5 discount, while another might be more effectively enticed by free shipping, and a third might be completely uninterested because they just made a large purchase. Using a merchant&#8217;s order history and website activity data, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gradient-decision-making" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gradient-decision-making">Bandit ML <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is supposed to help them determine which offer will be most effective with which shopper.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090301" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090301" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?w=680" alt="Bandit ML screenshot" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090301" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bandit ML</p></div></p>
<p>Conti acknowledged that there&#8217;s other discount-optimizing software out there, but he suggested none of them offers what Bandit ML does: &#8220;off the shelf tools that use machine learning the way giants like Uber, Amazon and Walmart do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Bandit ML&#8217;s technology is unique in its support for full automation (&#8220;some stores sent their first batch of offers within 10 minutes of signing up&#8221;) and its ability to optimize for longer-term metrics, like purchases over a 120-day period, rather than focusing on one-off redemptions. In fact, Conti said the technology the startup uses to make these decisions is similar to <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/open-sourcing-reagent-a-platform-for-reasoning-systems/">the ReAgent project</a> that he worked on at Facebook.</p>
<p>Bandit ML is currently focused on merchants with Shopify stores, though it also supports other stores not on Shopify, like Calii. Conti said the platform has been used to send millions of dollars&#8217; worth of promotions since July, with one clothing company seeing a 20% increase in net revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting with an always-on incentive engine for every online business, we aim to build functioning out-of-the-box machine learning tools that a small online business needs to compete with the Walmarts and Amazons of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has finished work on a new launchpad at its Kennedy Space Center in Florida &#8212; Launch Complex 48 (LC-48), a pad that will be able to support smaller launch vehicles than either LC-39A or B, or SLC-41, which currently host SpaceX, SLS and ULA launches, respectively. It&#8217;s designed to be able to be used by multiple providers, with an absence of permanent structures that allows for flexible configuration depending on who&#8217;s using it.</p>
<p>The purpose of LC-48 is very explicitly to fill &#8220;a need for new, low-cost launch systems with very fast turnaround cycles,&#8221; according to KSC senior project manager Keith Britton speaking to <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/12/kennedy-expands-complex-48-opens/">NASASpaceflight.com</a>. That sounds an awful lot like some of the forthcoming launch models being developed and tested by companies including Astra, a small launcher that designed its business around the now-ended DARPA competition for a responsive launch demonstration.</p>
<p>While companies like Virgin Orbit are aiming to create responsive, mobile launch capabilities by obviating the need for a specialized pad altogether, they are in the minority when it comes to small launch startups in terms of skipping the need for vertical take-off altogether. Many more companies, including Astra, as well as Firefly, Orbex and the newly revived Vector Launch, are focusing on small rockets that can be launched with scaled-down requirements in terms of both people and infrastructure required on site to add flexibility and mobility into their models.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LC-48 doesn&#8217;t yet have any actual customers booked &#8212; NASA says it&#8217;s in discussions with a number of companies, but none are yet officially signed customers. The agency does, however, anticipate some launches potentially taking place from the new pad as early as next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, Amazon’s flourishing cloud arm, has been growing at a rapid clip for more than a decade. An early public cloud infrastructure vendor, it has taken advantage of first-to-market status to become the most successful player in the space. In fact, one could argue that many of today&#8217;s startups wouldn&#8217;t have gotten off the ground without the formation of cloud companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> giving them easy access to infrastructure without having to build it themselves.</p>
<p>In <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> most-recent earnings report, AWS generated revenues of $11.6 billion, good for a run rate of more than $46 billion. That makes the next AWS milestone a run rate of $50 billion, something that could be in reach in less than two quarters if it continues its pace of revenue growth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The good news for competing companies is that in spite of the market size and relative maturity, there is still plenty of room to grow.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While the cloud division&#8217;s growth is slowing in percentage terms as it comes firmly up against the law of large numbers in which AWS has to grow every quarter compared to an ever-larger revenue base. The result of this dynamic is that while AWS’ year-over-year growth rate is slowing over time &#8212; from 35% in Q3 2019 to 29% in Q3 2020 &#8212; the pace at which it is adding $10 billion chunks of annual revenue run rate is accelerating.</p>
<p>At the AWS re:Invent customer conference this year, AWS CEO Andy Jassy talked about the pace of change over the years, saying that it took the following number of months to grow its run rate by $10 billion increments:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089363" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089363" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089363" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?w=680" alt="123 months ($0-$10 billion) 23 months ($10 billion-$20 billion) 13 months ($20 billion-$30 billion) 12 months ($30 billion to $40 billion)" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089363" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch (data from AWS)</p></div></p>
<p>Extrapolating from the above trend, it should take AWS fewer than 12 months to scale from a run rate of $40 billion to $50 billion. Stating the obvious, Jassy said “the rate of growth in AWS continues to accelerate.&#8221; He also took the time to point out that AWS is now the fifth-largest enterprise IT company in the world, ahead of enterprise stalwarts like SAP and Oracle.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s amazing is that AWS achieved its scale so fast, not even existing until 2006. That growth rate makes us ask a question: Can anyone hope to stop AWS’ momentum?</p>
<p>The short answer is that it doesn&#8217;t appear likely.</p>
<h2>Cloud market landscape</h2>
<p>A good place to start is surveying the cloud infrastructure competitive landscape to see if there are any cloud companies that could catch the market leader. According <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-growth-rate-nudges-amazon-and-microsoft-solidify-leadership">to Synergy Research</a>, AWS remains firmly in front, and it doesn&#8217;t look like any competitor could catch AWS anytime soon unless some market dynamic caused a drastic change.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089391" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089391" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?w=680" alt="Synergy Research Cloud marketshare leaders. Amazon is first, Microsoft is second and Google is third." width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089391" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Synergy Research</p></div></p>
<p>With around a third of the market, AWS is the clear front-runner. Its closest and fiercest rival Microsoft has around 20%. To put that into perspective a bit, last quarter AWS had $11.6 billion in revenue compared to Microsoft&#8217;s $5.2 billion Azure result. While Microsoft&#8217;s equivalent cloud number is growing faster at 47%, like AWS, that number has begun to drop steadily while it gains market share and higher revenue and it falls victim to that same law of large numbers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[If 2020 showed us how hard “Zoom school” really is, then 2021 should not be about creating more versions of Zoom schools.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The edtech market raked in more than $10 billion in venture capital investment globally in 2020, but for students, parents and teachers, the year was defined more by its scramble than its surge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-talwar/">Nandini Talwar</a>, a student and teacher’s assistant at Columbia University, wants to hold more efficient office hours so students don&#8217;t have to wait on a Zoom call. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tralizaking3189205/">TraLiza King</a>, a director at PWC and single mother, needs a Zoom alternative for her 4-year-old, who is too young to understand how to mute and unmute. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edukings/">Brian Kinglsey</a>, chief academic officer at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in North Carolina, is looking for ways to reengage remote students that don&#8217;t require socially distant home visits.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As we enter the rest of the decade, the sector will have to shake off its short-term-fix mentality to evolve from tunnel vision to wide-pan ambition.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Naturally, any company that shifts overnight from being a tool to a necessity will have growing pains, and edtech as a sector is no exception. Startups with the long-term ambitions of solving education&#8217;s inequities had to come up with quick fixes that would serve millions of learners. A sector that was notoriously undercapitalized had to reach venture scale while adapting to the realities of a remote work landscape like never before. As schools seesawed between hybrid and remote, education technology companies had to be nimble as well. The ubiquity of remote learning surely brought a boom to new users, but may have in fact limited the sector&#8217;s ability to innovate in lieu of fast, easy scale.</p>
<p>For edtech in 2020, flexible and scrappy was a survival tactic that led to profits, growth and most of all, aha moments that technology was needed in the way we learn. Now, as we enter the rest of the decade, the sector will have to shake off its short-term-fix mentality to evolve from tunnel vision to wide-pan ambition.</p>
<h2><strong>The innovation that must grow</strong></h2>
<p>If nothing else is clear after a tumultuous remote learning experience, it’s that the world needs effective and accessible technology that allows education to scale with learning for all in mind. In fact, the comeback story and surges of massive open online course providers (MOOCS) shows how in-demand digital curricula truly are.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/?tpcc=ECTW2020">usage is not a replacement for effectiveness</a>. In reality, most people don’t have the drive, motivation or comprehension capabilities to learn from a one-hour lecture &#8212; even if they technically show up.</p>
<p>The mad rush to track engagement is underway. In the past few months, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zovio launched Signalz, a tool that helps universities track student engagement and see who is most at risk for dropping out of courses. Piazza also launched a tool focused on college and high school student participation that allows instructors to send personalized messages and measure activity on their assignments. There&#8217;s also Rhithm, an app that allows educators to check in daily with students for emotional-learning insights, and Edsights, a chatbot for undergraduate students. </span></p>
<p>Still, instead of bringing the classroom experience online and trying to track the heck out of it, what if you completely upend it? The answer might begin with flashcards.</p>
<p>Quizlet, which started off as a flashcard app, has spent the past three years building out its artificial-intelligence-powered tutoring arm. CEO Matthew Glotzbach says the feature is now the most-used Quizlet offering, signaling how students want a more in-depth solution than flashcards.</p>
<p>The most recent example I saw of innovation was <a href="https://sketchy.com/">Sketchy</a>, a startup that teaches medical <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">concepts through illustrations</a>. It allows students to skip notecards and textbooks and comprehend through animated videos; think of a countryside kingdom scene about coronavirus or a salmon dinner about salmonella.</p>
<p>While the technology itself isn’t from Mars, Sketchy’s strategy does what many edtech solutions don’t: learning theory. The company uses the memory-palace technique to help students replace textbooks with videos and actually retain information. Plus, after seven years as a bootstrapped company, Sketchy just raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">$30 million dollars in venture capital</a>. The round was led by TCG with involvement from <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/">Reach Capital</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharysims/">Zach Sims</a>, the founder of<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> Codecademy</a>, told me that the startups that will “win” the next wave are the ones that are “using interactivity and technology to create an educational experience you just couldn&#8217;t have in the classroom.”</p>
<p>To retain recent gains, edtech companies need to replicate Sketchy’s strategy: Replace outdated systems and methods with new, tech-powered solutions. No more of the endless bundling and unbundling of the school experience. As we evolve into a world of life-long learning and cohort-based learning platforms, founders will need to be especially innovative with the way they deliver content. Don’t simply put engaging content on a screen, but innovate on what that screen looks like, tracks and offers. Is it rooted in true learning principles, or is it just a repacked lecture?</p>
<p>In other words, if 2020 showed us how hard “Zoom school” really is, then 2021 should not be about creating more versions of Zoom schools. It should be about playing an entirely different universe.</p>

<h2><strong>The hurdle that remains</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest elephant in the room for edtech is the one that every human in the world can&#8217;t wait for: the end of the coronavirus pandemic. And with promising vaccine news, the light at the end of the tunnel certainly feels within reach for those who dare to dream.</p>
<p>When the world recovers, startups that have based their entire business around remote learning and remote work will likely see a drop in usage. The surge will slow, and everyone in edtech is wondering how to extract post-pandemic value.</p>
<p>This in mind, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleymbittner/">Ashley Bittner</a>, co-founding partner of <a href="https://www.firework.vc/">Firework Ventures</a>, a new future of work fund, thinks that the next generation of edtech founders should continue to make moonshot bets, but be realistic about what will work for the decades ahead.</p>
<p>“Anyone can pitch an idea about how we should do math curriculum,” she said. “But there’s a reason behind why we teach kids to do it this way. I don’t think there’s enough respect for the experience learning science behind products.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In this country, we have a longstanding peaceful transfer of power for the executive office, even in the wake of the hardest-fought elections. Certain circumstances have led many to question whether the tradition will continue come January 20. Despite his very vocal protestations, however, the current president has<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-will-leave-if-electoral-college-votes-for-biden/2020/11/26/7883351c-303b-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html"> agreed to step aside</a>, should all of his legal maneuvers fall short (something that seems all but a certainty at this point).</p>
<p>There is, of course, nothing in the Constitution that offers guidance the peaceful transition of passwords &#8212; strangely, the forefathers of this country didn’t possess the foresight to predict <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The service has already outlined what happens to Trump’s account when he leaves office. Namely, he loses the protections that come with being a political figure.</p>
<p>CEO Jack Dorsey noted this at last month’s congressional hearings, stating, “If an account suddenly is not a world leader anymore, that particular policy goes away.” But what of the incoming president? What will the transition look like for Biden? And what happens if Trump doesn’t willingly give up the official @Potus account as has also been suggested?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden transition says Trump admin has refused to transfer the <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WhiteHouse</a> Twitter accounts with followers and that Biden must start from zero — reversing goodwill gesture from Obama admin in 2016.</p>
<p>&mdash; Hugo Lowell (@hugolowell) <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1341432767888957442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He hasn’t exactly been eager to accept the results of this election and he’s not the sort to willingly give up a platform &#8212; particularly one with 33 million followers (admittedly a fraction of Trump’s main account).</p>
<p>Nick Pacilio, of Twitter’s Communications, Government &amp; News team, offered TechCrunch the following statement, on the matter: “Twitter has been in ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers.”</p>
<p>The company, perhaps understandably, didn’t answer the question directly, but working with the incoming team is a simple enough way to circumvent any issues transferring more than one dozen accounts, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198?st=qipqi5w4hwb57f8&amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare">The Wall Street Journal notes</a>. As has been reported, existing tweets will be deleted and the incoming administration will start from scratch &#8212; a net positive for the Biden team, given the…polarizing nature of the previous president’s feed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/531292-biden-campaign-official-says-twitter-will-wipe-potus-accounts-followers">Biden’s digital director</a>, the POTUS and White House accounts will also reset to zero followers, marking a change over the Obama to Trump transition. Donald Trump’s personal Twitter account has already lost one prominent follower. Earlier this week, CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-unfollow-trump-biden-20201221-keobkswhqfbzhekd67g36zpjue-story.html">unfollowed the president</a>, along with other prominent politicians, including Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even in a non-hell year, running a successful startup is a tremendous lift. After the events of 2020, however, no doubt many already lean businesses are hanging on by the skin of their teeth. For every company that saw increased interest in their offerings during the pandemic, there were several that simply couldn’t make it through the finish line.</p>
<p>We’ve put this list together for several years now. It’s not a fun task, but it seems worthwhile to commemorate the startups that have closed up shop over the past 12 months. (Some of them were acquired by larger companies before shutting down, but all of them began their life as startups, and it still felt worthwhile to mark the end of their stories.) It also offers an opportunity to examine those issues from a bit of distance to see if there are any broader takeaways for the community at large.</p>
<p>This year’s list is among the most diverse we’ve done, ranging from standard smaller-name closures to big blockbuster crashes like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quibi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quibi">Quibi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/essential-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="essential-2">Essential <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. For some, the pandemic was the final nail in the coffin, but in many cases, cracks in business models were already starting to surface well before COVID-19 ground the global economy to a screeching halt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/atrium-shuts-down/">Atrium (2017-2020)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Total Raised:</strong> $75 million</p>

<p>Atrium, a 100-person legal tech startup founded by Justin Kan, shut down in March after failing to find an efficient way to replace the arduous systems of law firms. The startup even returned some of its $75.5 million in funding to its investors, including Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The shutdown comes after the platform had pivoted just months earlier, laying off in-house lawyers and turning into a clearer SaaS play. Ultimately, Atrium’s failure shows how difficult and unprofitable it could be to disrupt a traditional and complicated system.</p>
<p>The closure came just three years after it launched with the goal to build software for startups to navigate fundraising, hiring, acquisition deals and collaboration with their legal team.</p>

<p>Big plans, big names and a boatload of money should have been enough to buy Essential a lengthy runway. Sure, Essential was entering a mature and oversaturated market, but the Playground-backed startup was doing so with $330 million in funding, a team of top industry executives and some genuinely innovative ideas.</p>
<p>When I spoke to the company at launch, an executive outlined a 10-year plan to become a major player in both the mobile and smart home categories. Ultimately, the company was able to eke out just under three years of life after coming out of stealth. And while it did give the world a promising handset, its connected home hub never arrived.</p>
<p>Timing, broader marketing issues and troubling allegations of sexual misconduct were all contributing factors that stopped Essential’s big plans dead in their tracks.</p>

<p>HubHaus, founded by Shruti Merchant, was a long-term housing rental platform rooted in the belief that adult dormitories would take off. The startup targeted working professionals in cities, and raised only around $11 million in known venture capital. When it came to raising a Series B, Merchant says the company struggled to close and lost investor interest due to WeWork’s failed IPO.</p>
<p>After then pivoting to a self-funded company, HubHaus was just finding footing when the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the United States, drastically hurting the rental market (as shown by Airbnb’s public struggles, as well). The housing company eventually decided to close down in September, leaving landlords, members and vendors in limbo and bringing on a fresh sweep of critique and controversy.</p>
<p>Affordable housing continues to be an issue in the Bay Area, and HubHaus’s departure from the scene underscores this truth.</p>

Goldstein and Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman, was one of the first travel aggregation platforms on the market.

<p>The focus was enough for the platform to get acquired by Concur, but now after four years, the travel startup shut down. Notably, the travel startup’s closure wasn’t necessarily tied to the coronavirus pandemic. The site officially went dark on January 23, months before lockdowns came to the United States.</p>

<p>IfOnly had created a marketplaces of exclusive events — such as &#8220;goat yoga&#8221; — a business that faced obvious challenges during the pandemic. The startup was actually acquired by one of its investors, Mastercard, late last year, but the acquisition wasn&#8217;t announced until IfOnly revealed over the summer that it was shutting down.</p>

<p>Microsoft shut down its Twitch competitor Mixer this year, handing off its partnerships to Facebook Gaming. The service had its roots in the software giant&#8217;s acquisition of Beam Interactive shortly after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/beam-wants-to-turn-gaming-streams-wildly-dynamic/">won TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Before giving up, Microsoft made some big investments in Mixer&#8217;s success, most notably signing streaming superstars Ninja and Shroud to exclusive deals. (They became free agents after the shutdown.) However, Microsoft&#8217;s gaming chief Phil Spencer said the company suffered from starting out &#8220;pretty far behind&#8221; the biggest players in the streaming market.</p>

<p>Despite a busy year of innovation and venture for news media platforms, The Outline, which branded itself as “the next generation version of the New Yorker” was shut down. The media site was started by Josh Topolsky and had an explicit focus on serving millennials with a digital-first news media brand.</p>
<p>The shutdown was part of a broader layoffs at Bustle Digital Group, which acquired the publication in 2019. Pre-acquisition, The Outline had already scaled back its editorial staff and refocused on freelance articles. (Input — a tech site that Topolsky founded for BDG — continues to publish.)</p>

<p>Periscope went out with more of a whimper than a bang. The startup was acquired by Twitter before it had even launched a product. With Meerkat bursting on the scene that year at SXSW, Twitter went on the offensive, buying the startup to build out its own live video offering.</p>
<p>Periscope’s run was decent as far as these things go, and its technology will live on as part of Twitter’s video offerings, even after the app is officially discontinued next March. But in the end, Periscope was a shell of its former self. In fact, this is a rare instance where the pandemic may have actually delayed its shutdown.</p>
<p>The company notes, “We probably would have made this decision sooner if it weren’t for all of the projects we reprioritized due to the events of 2020.”</p>

<p>The company made beer-brewing machines that used coffee pod-style PicoPaks, then expanded into other categories like coffee and tea, but never quite attracted enough customers to make the business viable. It sold its assets earlier this year to PB Funding Group — a group of lenders recruited by then-CEO Bill Mitchell in 2018 to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that PicoBrew will live on in some form, as PB Funding Group says it&#8217;s seeking buyers for the company&#8217;s patents and other intellectual property, and that it will keep the website running in the short term so that the machines don&#8217;t stop working.</p>

<p>More so than any tech company in recent memory (with the possible exception of Theranos), Quibi’s existence feels like a fever dream. $1.75 billion in funding later and what do we have to show for it? “Fierce Queens,” a nature documentary about female animals. The HGTV-style program, “Murder House Flip.” And, of course, “The Shape of Pasta.” A show about pasta.</p>
<p>Early reports of the service’s demise seemed premature &#8212; if only because there was seemingly no way a company could burn through that much capital that quickly. By late-October, however, it was over. “All that is left now is to offer a profound apology for disappointing you and, ultimately, for letting you down,” founders Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman wrote in an open letter.</p>
<p>Sometimes startup failures are bad timing. Sometimes it’s just plain bad luck. With Quibi, the diagnoses of what went wrong can be summed up in one word: everything.</p>

<p>Rubica spun out of security company Concentric Advisors with the aim of offering tools that were more advanced than antivirus software, while still remaining accessible to individuals and small businesses. CEO and co-founder Frances Dewing said that when customers cut back on spending during the pandemic, the company tried to shift its focus to larger enterprise, but it failed to convince investors there was a business there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were all really surprised given how relevant and needed this is right now,” she said. “Investors didn’t agree with that or see it in the same way.”</p>

<p>ScaleFactor was a startup claiming to offer artificial intelligence tools that could replace accountants for small businesses; it blamed the pandemic for cutting its revenue in half and forcing the company to shut down. However, former employees and customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=5a7dcbd52928">told Forbes a different story</a> — that ScaleFactor actually relied on human accountants (including an outsourced team in the Philippines) to do the work.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hardly unprecedented for a startup to fudge the truth about their level of automation versus human labor, this reportedly resulted in error-filled accounting for ScaleFactor clients. (Responding to a fact-checking email, former CEO Kurt Rathmann said the email was &#8220;filled with numerous factual inaccuracies and misrepresentation&#8221; and declined to comment further.)</p>

<p>“In 2019, our truck became the first fully-unmanned truck to drive on a live highway,” Starsky Robotics co-founder and CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher wrote in a Medium post in March. &#8220;And in 2020, we’re shutting down.” After five years and $20 million in funding, the autonomous trucking company shut its doors that month. It wasn’t for lack of ambition or demand &#8212; it seems safe to assume there’s still a bright future for self-driving trucks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Starsky won’t be along for that ride &#8212; a fact Seltz-Axmacher blames largely on timing. A crowded market is certainly at play, as well, with countless companies currently pushing to bring autonomous technology to the road.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018 by ex-Googlers, Stockwell AI shut down after being unable to find business for its in-building smart vending machines that stocked everything from condoms to La Croix. The company blamed the “current landscape” (also known as the global pandemic we are experiencing) for its closure.</p>
<p>Stockwell AI, formerly known as Bodega, was well-funded and well-known, with more than $45 million in funding from investors that included NEA, GV, DCM Ventures, Forerunner, First Round and Homebrew. Still, even venture capital couldn’t make vending machines work well enough.</p>

<p>Another travel-focused startup bites the dust as the coronavirus limits the chance to safely explore the world (let alone your neighborhood). Trover, a photo-sharing hub for travelers acquired by Expedia, shut down in August. The startup was founded by Rich Barton and Jason Karas and was meant to connect people travelling to the same places. The startup had quite the life: it began out of the remains of TravelPost, a travel review site, and got scooped up by its parent company when it only had $2.5 million in funding. Unfortunately, its nine-year journey is over for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MIT&#8217;s famous Media Lab, the multidisciplinary idea factory that produces many a fascinating invention and influential thinker, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/media-lab-director-newman-1222">has found a new director</a> in its backyard after scouring the globe for candidates. Dava Newman, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics and former deputy administrator of NASA under Obama, will helm the intellectual hub.</p>
<p>The Media Lab is famed for its freewheeling techno-intellectual prowess, but for more than a year has been leaderless following the resignation of former head Joi Ito. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/07/joi-ito-resigns-as-mit-media-lab-head-in-wake-of-jeffrey-epstein-reporting/">Ito resigned</a> when it was discovered that billionaire and alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had given funding and reportedly received special treatment and access to the Media Lab under his leadership.</p>
<p>The ensuing leadership search no doubt looked for, if not exactly new blood (Newman has been involved with MIT for decades) then certainly a break from the past. Out of 60 candidates, they interviewed 13 and ended up picking Newman for a variety of reasons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In a field of outstanding candidates, Professor Newman stood out for her pioneering research, wide range of multidisciplinary engagements, and exemplary leadership. She is a designer, a thinker, a maker, an engineer, an educator, a mentor, a convener, a communicator, a futurist, a humanist and, importantly, an optimist,&#8221; wrote Dean Hashim Sarkis in a letter announcing the appointment.</p>
<p>Coincidentally (or is it?), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/building-the-workforce-of-the-future-2/">Newman just last week was a speaker at TC Sessions: Space</a>, where she seemed to give a preview of her new responsibilities talking about the importance of inclusion in major efforts like NASA&#8217;s Artemis.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to bring the scientists and engineers together, but we need the artists, we need the designers, they&#8217;re the visionaries,&#8221; she said. (If you missed the event, you can watch this and all our other panels on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>.)</p>
<p>Newman seems to be starting off the job by emphasizing one of the best qualities a leader should have: listening to the people she&#8217;ll be leading.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to start by doing a lot of listening and learning,&#8221; she said in the MIT announcement. &#8220;I like to meet people where they are, and to encourage them to put all their great ideas on the table. I think that’s the best way to go forward, working with the whole community — faculty, students and staff — to tap into everyone’s creativity. I can’t wait to get started.&#8221;</p>
