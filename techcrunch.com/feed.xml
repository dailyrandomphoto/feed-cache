										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has its first-ever woman as Chair of the agency, Jessica Rosenworcel, who has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">serving as acting Chair</a> since the beginning of the year. President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/26/president-biden-announces-key-nominations-8/">officially appointed her</a> to the position today, and nominated her for a new term — as well as FCC veteran and tireless policy advocate Gigi Sohn, who if confirmed would become the first openly LGBTQ+ Commissioner in history.</p>
<p>The appointment has been a long time coming for Rosenworcel, who has worked at the FCC for nearly 20 years, and has been a Commissioner for half that time, under three different presidents. She was among the authors and advocates for net neutrality and may yet succeed, despite the controversial binning of the policy under former Chairman Ajit Pai during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, of course: Rosenworcel has consistently worked for telecommunication and broadcast policies that are equitable and important, such as accessibility services and the huge Emergency Connectivity Fund currently being distributed. And she&#8217;s fought tooth and nail against robocalls, unethical data sharing, and attempts to make the FCC into, as she put it at the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/with-absurd-timing-fcc-announces-intention-to-revisit-section-230/">&#8220;the president&#8217;s speech police.&#8221;</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply humbled to be designated as Chair of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden. It is an honor to work with my colleagues on the Commission and the agency’s talented staff to ensure that no matter who you are or where you live, everyone has the connections they need to live, work, and learn in the digital age,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>As acting Chair, Rosenworcel was fully empowered to do her duty, but there was some question as to whether she would receive the full time offer. One of the five positions at the FCC has remained conspicuously empty for more than a year, though President Biden could have nominated someone to it at any time. It was therefore an open question whether the administration was waiting to find the right person (who may also serve as Chair), avoiding an unfavorable nomination environment, or just dragging its feet. I suspect only time will tell, but whatever the case, the nomination today of Gigi Sohn is smart and portentous. (Funnily enough, I spoke with her earlier this year about, among other things, likely nominees. She did not, to my recollection, mention herself.)</p>
<p>Sohn, Georgetown Law fellow and co-founder of Public Knowledge, served as general counsel for Chairman Tom Wheeler back in 2013-2016. Some may recognize this era as the big net neutrality push.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DdF9eqZw8n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/">Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=DdF9eqZw8n" data-secret="DdF9eqZw8n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is as big a hint as we&#8217;re likely to get that the FCC under Biden is winding up for a second shot at the popular policy, which prohibits companies from discriminating in their handling of different data streams. (For instance, Comcast couldn&#8217;t give priority on its broadband services to its own streaming apps.)</p>
<p>Having been taught a number of hard legal lessons and learned what is risky and what is merely politically charged, a new net neutrality policy would likely be leaner, smarter, and more forward thinking. Sohn, already a legal expert in these matters, has been making a study of the challenges faced during net neutrality&#8217;s extended court battle — so the new one, if and when it exists, will be likely be very shrewdly and comprehensively justified legally.</p>
<p>As if her qualifications weren&#8217;t enough, Sohn would also if confirmed become the first LGBTQ+ Commissioner, making this FCC extra historic.</p>
<p>Both will have to have their Commissioner positions (though not Rosenworcel&#8217;s chairship) confirmed by the Senate, which that august body can hopefully find time for between negotiation sessions over Biden&#8217;s spending bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2021/10/apple-one-premier-expands-to-17-new-countries/">expanding</a> its all-in-one <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a> Premier subscription bundle to 17 new countries on November 3rd. The service will be available in Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>In these countries, Apple One Premier will include Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, and 2TB of iCloud storage. The bundle can be shared among up to six family members. It’s worth noting that Apple News+ will not be part of Apple One Premier in these countries, as it is in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K (News and News+ aren&#8217;t available in these new markets currently). With this upcoming expansion, Apple One Premier will be available in 21 countries in total.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finding a way to connect with people who might buy from you, while spending less time pursuing those who will never be interested, is something akin to a holy grail of the world of sales and marketing. Now, a startup called <a href="https://www.usergems.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserGems</a>, which has built a platform that combines AI with data mapping to help identify the most likely candidates for B2B sales and marketing prospecting &#8212; by making it easier to connect with those who have been customers before who have now moved to different jobs &#8212; is announcing $20 million in funding &#8212; pointing to the opportunity for sales tech that helps address this challenge.</p>
<p>The Series A is being led by Craft Ventures with Battery Ventures and Tiger Global &#8212; both new investors &#8212; and previous backer Uncork Capital also participating, along with individual angels. It brings the total raised by the startup to $22.4 million.</p>
<p>UserGems now has some 90 customers in the mid-market segment, including Procore, Medallia, UserTesting, Sisense, and BrightTALK. It plans to use the funding both to invest in product and talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223218" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Based out of San Francisco, UserGems has an interesting origin story that speaks to how sometimes ideas and businesses can grow out of unlikely places.</p>
<p>Christian Kletzl, the Austrian CEO and co-founder of UserGems, was living in Chicago after getting an MBA at Northwestern, when he encouraged his twin brother Stephan &#8212; who had been working for PwC in Europe &#8212; to come to the U.S. and join him in building a startup.</p>
<p>They came up with ShelfFlip, an e-commerce effort that aimed to compete against the eBay/Craiglists of the world with more efficient technology to sell your books, electronics and other pre-owned items. Early on, the pair applied to join Y Combinator with the idea, and they got in, but the concept wasn&#8217;t really taking off for the pair.</p>
<div>&#8220;We went into YC with <span class="il">ShelfFlip</span>, but scraped the idea during the batch,&#8221; Christian said. &#8220;We were motivated by the large list of companies that pivoted during YC and went back to the drawing board. We talked to a lot of companies in our batch and outside and came up with the idea of SmartHires,&#8221; a referral network for startups within the same investment portfolio.</div>
<p>We covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/20/yc-backed-smarthires-helps-startups-find-tech-talent-within-the-same-investment-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, after the startup joined YC as part of the Winter &#8217;15 cohort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of what the brothers built for SmartHires was software they could use to track when one customer (specifically one of SmartHires&#8217; &#8220;main champions&#8221; said Christian) moved from one company to another. Startups have a high rate of turnover, and so when the brothers mentioned this to some others in the cohort, they got enthusiastic about it&#8230; more than they were about SmartHires itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;More people seemed interested in that than our actual company, and that is how UserGems came to be,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Basically we pivoted twice since the YC days.&#8221;</p>
<p>UserGems is built on two basic ideas: how sales and marketing move; and how much of the modern workforce moves.</p>
<p>On the workforce side, as Christian describes it, the days of having a job for life, or even for several years, is long gone for many, and we have now entered &#8220;the great resignation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the databases and sites that UserGems tracks &#8212; it covers and processes information from a wide range of publicly-available sources of information, ranging from Google searches through to news articles and much more &#8212; at least 20% of people change jobs every year. That means it&#8217;s hard to predict regularly when a person in one position will be there the next time you look.</p>
<p>As for sales and marketing, these have become massively data-driven exercises in the digital age: we have more information about people than ever before, and more software than ever before to manage contacting them en masse, more channels to do it, more analytics to measure how well they work, and so on. That however doesn&#8217;t change the fact that when it comes to successful sales and marketing, the hit rate is significantly higher when it involves people who are already familiar with you or might be more readily interested in what you are selling.</p>
<p>UserGems essentially brings these two state of affairs together: It&#8217;s a tool for sales and marketing types that integrates with whatever CRM they are already using, to help track people who they have done business with previously, to continue working with them elsewhere, where they become &#8220;prime candidates for marketing,&#8221; Christian said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a treasure trove to utilize in the sales process.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p11">He notes that in some ways what UserGems is not new: the best salespeople essentially already keep detailed records and tabs on their best contacts. What UserGems does is allow anyone to essentially do this &#8220;at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also just the first step of the platform that UserGems has built out. After contacts are established, machine learning algorithms then start to learn more about who users contact so that it can recommend which people they should be reaching out to next, based on similar product usage and other signals, to find those prospects who are more likely to buy.</p>
<p>On one side UserGems is competing against the likes of ZoomInfo, LinkedIn, and other platforms that help people search for the right sales prospects at specific companies; on the other it&#8217;s also sitting in another area of sales technology more generally known as predictive sales, where you have really fast-growing startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/people-ai-the-predictive-sales-startup-raises-60m-at-around-500m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People.ai</a> (which has seen some Covid-19 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/sales-startup-people-ai-lays-off-18-of-staff-raises-debt-round-amid-covid-19-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing pains</a> but bounced back and is now valued at <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/08/11/peopleai-joins-unicorns-in-100m-funding.html?page=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $1 billion</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/leadiqs-rapid-revenue-growth-snags-venture-attention-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeadIQ</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/6sense-raises-125m-at-a-2-1b-valuation-for-its-id-graph-an-ai-based-predictive-sales-and-marketing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6sense</a> (now valued at over $2 billion). But with the trends around employment churn set to continue, and that creating yet more complexity on the sales side, it&#8217;s an area where clever approaches to solving the issue are bound to continue to get attention, one reason why the likes of Tiger Global &#8212; which has been behind also some of the biggest follow-on rounds for enterprise startups &#8212; is getting in early here.</p>
<p>&#8220;B2B sales and marketers today have a hard time cutting through the noise—most follow the same demand generation playbooks and send hundreds of generic sales emails and sequences. That’s why many sales teams miss quota and customer acquisition costs skyrockets,” said Brian Murray, Partner and COO, Craft Ventures, in a statement. “UserGems understands that past users are future opportunities, and has become an undeniable asset for high-growth teams, driving bigger pipelines, increasing win rates, and reducing churn.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweetgreen is an incredibly well-backed unicorn that just happens to make salads instead of, say, enterprise software.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is expected to price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">its IPO</a> later today and trade tomorrow morning, provided that all things go as planned. Udemy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/udemy-files-to-go-public-on-back-of-growing-b2b-incomes/">also on the way to the public markets</a>. Allbirds, too.</p>
<p>And this week, Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521306603/d104360ds1.htm">threw its hat into the ring</a>.</p>
<p>Sweetgreen is a food chain best known for salads that are popular with the office-lunching crew. I can safely say that as a longtime member of that cohort back when I worked in an office in a major city.</p>
<p>Why are we talking about a fast-casual restaurant chain here on TechCrunch? Because Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sweetgreen/company_financials">raised hundreds of millions of dollars</a> during its life as a private company, including myriad venture capital rounds &#8212; through a Series <em>I</em> in 2019 &#8212; along with capital from other investors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an incredibly well-backed unicorn, in other words. It just happens to make salads instead of, say, enterprise software.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s take a dive into its IPO filing, working to both understand the company&#8217;s business and its results. We&#8217;ll close with notes on how we have no idea how to price the company, a similar issue that we had with Rent the Runway.</p>
<p>The following days and weeks are going to prove illustrative in terms of the value of tech-enabled businesses, especially in contrast to more digital and hard-tech efforts. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/tech-valuations-vs-tech-enabled-valuations-2020-ipo-edition/">Yet again</a>.</p>
<h2>The fast-casual food game</h2>
<p>Sweetgreen operates its 140 food spots in 13 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., with some 1.35 million customers placing at least one order in the 90 days concluding September 26, 2021. And for a technology angle, some 68% of Sweetgreen revenue was generated from digital orders for its fiscal year to date, which ended September 26.</p>
<p>As noted above, office culture has proved to be no small part of Sweetgreen&#8217;s growth. Per the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, observe how it discusses the impact of COVID-19 &#8212; which disrupted going to offices, period &#8212; on its business (emphasis: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p>We experienced a decline in our In-Store Channel due to the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal year 2020, particularly in central business districts, which was partially offset by strong sales in our suburban locations and strong off-premises digital sales across all markets. <strong>For our fiscal year to date through September 26, 2021, we experienced positive momentum across all of our channels, as COVID-19 vaccines became widely available and customers started to return to offices.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Sweetgreen has consistently expanded during its life, noting in the same filing that it had &#8220;119 restaurants as of the end of fiscal year 2020,&#8221; and 140 as of the end of September of this year. That growth has not been inexpensive, with Sweetgreen &#8220;targeting&#8221; an &#8220;average investment of approximately $1.2 million per new restaurant&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>Powering Sweetgreen in the background are a few trends that the company views as accretive, including a consumer shift toward more plant-based eating and &#8220;rapid adoption of digital and delivery,&#8221; key channels for the food chain&#8217;s revenue growth.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about Sweetgreen the brand, the company&#8217;s overall business plan appears sound on paper. People are eating healthier and ordering more via delivery. Salads transport well &#8212; they are not soup &#8212; and are as plant-based as you&#8217;d like. And because it is possible to make money selling food, why not Sweetgreen?</p>
<p>So, how has the company managed in business terms during its last few years of growth? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h2>Does Sweetgreen&#8217;s business generate sweet amounts of green?</h2>
<p>No, it does not.</p>
<p>In fact, Sweetgreen is rather unprofitable and doesn&#8217;t appear to be on the cusp of a rapid march toward profitability. Not that losing money is a sin, per se; many venture-backed companies run stiff deficits while they scale. That is the <em>point</em> of raising private capital, to invest it at the cost of near-term profitability and cash flow.</p>
<p>But Sweetgreen is no corporate child. It was founded in 2007, per Crunchbase data, making it nearly old enough to secure a learner&#8217;s permit to drive in the United States. If a human can get to the point of nigh-maturity in a time frame, surely corporations made up of adults and backed by mountains of private capital can manage the same?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the data:</p>

<p>Note that time flows east to west on this particular table, so the company&#8217;s most recent full fiscal year is on the far left.</p>
<p>As we can see from the two most recent fiscal years, 2020 was a pretty hard time for Sweetgreen, which saw its revenues decline from $274.2 million to $220.6 million, and its net losses double from $67.9 million to $141.2 million over the same time frame.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/series-b-40m-to-build-the-next-web">well-funded</a> company behind the popular <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> React framework, today announced the launch of Next.js 12 during a keynote at its <a href="https://nextjs.org/conf">annual conference</a>.</p>
<p>While Next.js, by default, mostly focuses on helping developers build static sites, Next.js 12 introduces what Vercel calls &#8216;middleware&#8217; that makes it easier for developers to provide users with personalized content. Next.js 12, which Vercel likes to call &#8220;the SDK for the Web,&#8221; also introduces support for ES modules and URL imports, instant HMR and builds, and significant workflow and collaboration innovations.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> and static sites became popular because they were empowering front-end developers to push to the edge,&#8221; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch said. &#8220;But over the years, we started noticing that developers and consumers loved the speed of pre-rendered artifacts at the edge. But they didn&#8217;t love the constraints of static workloads, namely anything around user personalization, feature flags and A/B testing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Edge functions on the Vercel platform and the corresponding programming model enhancements to the Next.js framework will now give customers &#8220;the power of dynamic at the speed of static,&#8221; as Rauch put it. The combination of Middleware, as Vercel calls this new API, and Vercel&#8217;s Edge Functions allows developers to deploy this code globally with only a few lines of code at deploy time.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re running an A/B experiment, in the world before Middleware, your experiment would carry the bulk of both tests. I have the A test and the B test together. With middleware, because we&#8217;re able to make these choices before that request gets served, we can say, &#8216;oh, here&#8217;s just A or here&#8217;s just B and C&#8217; and you get that highly performant experiment,&#8221; Kevin Van Gundy, Vercel&#8217;s CRO, explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Major League Baseball is experimenting with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-11/mlb-rule-changes-atlantic-league-tests-tweaks-meant-to-save-baseball?sref=gni836kR">robot umpires</a> to make games more interesting, but when it comes to sporty shenanigans, Internet League <a href="http://blaseball.com">Blaseball</a> has got you more than covered. After going on hiatus at the end of its public beta, the free, browser-based, absurdist baseball simulator is coming back. On November 1, the Hugo- and Nebula-nominated game will launch Short Circuits, a &#8220;short, low-stakes, mini-series of temporary universes&#8221; designed to onboard new fans into the delightfully messy realm of Blaseball.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Developed by </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://thegameband.com/">The Game Band</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Blaseball is just a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fantasy-fantasy-sport-blaseball-developers-score-3m-seed-funding-to-go-mobile/">fantasy fantasy sport</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> at first glance &#8212; you pick your team and bet on games, but players are named Peanut Bong, PolkaDot Patterson and Jaylen Hotdogfingers instead of something like&#8230; David Ortiz? Derek Jeter? Alex Rodriguez? But with its broad world-building, rogue umpires and high-stakes boss fights against peanut monsters, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Blaseball is just as appealing to &#8220;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#8221; roleplayers as it is to people who know what an RBI is. There&#8217;s a detailed plot to all this, which fans influence through voting in end-of-season elections. The developers say that the key difference between baseball and Blaseball is player participation &#8212; fan decisions can impact the course of league, even changing the rules of the game. The collaborative nature of the game helped Blaseball develop a deeply devoted fanbase &#8212; there&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/weekinblaseball">podcasts</a>, <a href="https://blaseballthemusical.com/">musicals</a>, <a href="https://www.blaseballcares.com/">fan-run charity shops</a>, <a href="https://sibr.dev/">data analysis hubs</a>, <a href="https://blaseball.news/">news outlets</a>, even a prolific, international <a href="https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/">rock collective</a>.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223957" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223957" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="606" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png 1049w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?resize=300,267 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?resize=768,685 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?resize=680,606 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blaseball-Short-Circuits-The-Discipline-Era.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blaseball</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But if &#8220;broad world-building, rogue umpires and high-stakes boss fights against peanut monsters&#8221; has you feeling confused, you&#8217;re not alone. As the small team of developers found their footing over 24 week-long seasons, the lore and plot of the game started to become too confusing for even the most devoted fans to follow.</p>
<p>So, with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fantasy-fantasy-sport-blaseball-developers-score-3m-seed-funding-to-go-mobile/">$3 million seed round</a> in tow, the Blaseball developers are exploring ways to make the game more manageable to run and more accessible for new fans. They nullified the existing story line by <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Season_24">absorbing the league into a Black Hole</a> (don&#8217;t worry about it) and went on hiatus in July.</p>
<p>Now, Blaseball will attempt to woo fans new and old with Short Circuits. This series of short tests will bring Blaseball back to basics, making it easy for new fans to get into the game. Each Short Circuit will last two weeks, and after each one wraps, The Game Band will send users surveys about their experience with mechanics new and old. Short Circuits will also allow Blaseball to test new betting and election systems, integral parts of the game that haven&#8217;t been meaningfully updated since Blaseball first launched in July 2020.</p>
<p>To check out the first Short Circuit, users can sign up on <a href="http://blaseball.com">blaseball.com</a>, where the games will kick off on November 1 at 8 AM PT.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipulhpatel/">Vipul Patel</a> lost half of his college credits while transferring from Florida Institute of Technology to Boston University, he began digging for answers. Patel soon stumbled upon <a href="https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-credit">equivalency tables</a>, where universities track which courses from other institutions can be counted for credit during a transfer process. While seemingly innocuous, the tables gave him key data of where Boston University draws a line around accepting credits from other institutions &#8211; and where it contradicts itself.</p>
<p>He eventually appealed to BU, a school I also attended, and pointed out that the university accepted credit from universities that accepted FIT&#8217;s coursework. The argument worked, and the small-yet-lucrative win inspired his other transfer friends to appeal for their once-lost credits.</p>
<p>The resulting buzz, and the fact that<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014163.pdf"> 39.4% of transfer students lose all their credits</a> when they transfer, gave Patel the confidence to turn his tool into a startup. Today, he and his co-founder, Nelson Huang, announced the launch of <a href="https://www.tasseled.com/">Tasseled</a>, a free platform to help students create and customize their own college plans with credits in mind.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.tasseled.com/">Tasseled</a>, which opened up a waitlist for its private beta today, is a member of the All Turtles product studio, the incubator behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-mmhmm-story-and-how-it-plans-to-spend-its-100m/">mmhmm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/fertility-startup-carrot-raises-3-6-million-to-make-ivf-and-egg-freezing-more-affordable/">Carrot. </a>Patel says that the company has raised $750,000 in funding since its founding in 2018.</p>
<p>The service helps students identify what credits they need to graduate, and then helps them substitute expensive university classes with cheaper, more accessible community college equivalents. Taking a note from Patel’s experience, Tasseled is built with transfer students in mind: it highlights ways to fit in for-credit education from different places, either an online course or local community college class, into a four-year university plan.</p>
<p>Tasseled is pitching its service to college students, and high school students who are planning for college. The team collected, and centralized, information about application deadlines and tuition to help students turn their planning process into &#8220;a weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2223956" style="width: 879px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223956" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2223956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png" alt="tasseled" width="869" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png 1900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=768,457 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=1536,914 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tasseled-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223956" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tasseled</p></div></p>
<p>“We’re already expecting a bunch of kids [who] are 17 and 18 to make a multi-hundred thousand dollar financial decision,” Patel said. “And, that’s kind of crazy. They&#8217;re simply making life-altering decisions with no information and our hope is that we can just close that.”</p>
<p>Tasseled&#8217;s bet on community colleges filling in gaps for students is further proof that financial inclusion is a big focus for the startup. On one end, extinguishing the stigma around community colleges will help more students lean on their local schools (and less on loans) to complete their degrees. On the other end, students who transfer from community colleges can sometimes come from low-income backgrounds, so Tasseled helps them make sure their for-credit work doesn&#8217;t go unrecognized by wherever they end up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup has not figured out a business model yet, but could monetize using referral fees for any community college that gets a student through its platform.</span></p>
<p>Tasseled has evolved multiple times, even in its short life. It first started as an appeals tool, offering students a hacky way to get credits counted. Then, after students left campus in May, Tasseled pivoted to a full-stack solution to help colleges make transfer student decisions quicker. Then, COVID-19 dried up an already dehydrated sales cycle within higher-ed, so that didn’t work, either. Ultimately, Tasseled landed on returning to a simple but massive mission: help students save money.</p>

<p>Fittingly, Patel says that Tasseled&#8217;s early days began on Boston University campus. The startup worked with Director Ziba Cranmer over at BU Spark, an initiative for student entrepreneurship, to get a sense of how to build and how to talk to users. Cranmer introduced the co-founders to Phil Libin, a Boston University alum and the co-founder of All Turtles, at a Spark event.</p>
<p>&#8220;In startup mode, you feel like there&#8217;s every single avenue to go down, and both [of them] were the most impactful people at making sure I stay clear about building products for students,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Survival of the Fittest: Investing in Today’s SaaS Market:</strong> The venture capital world is faster, and more competitive than ever. For investors hoping to get into the hottest SaaS deal, things are even crazier. With more non-traditional money pouring into the sector, remote dealmaking now the norm, and an increasingly global market for software startups, venture capitalists are being forced to shake up their own operations, and expectations. TechCrunch sits down with Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures), Kobie Fuller (Upfront Ventures) and Sarah Guo (Greylock) to discuss how they are fighting for allocation in hot deals, what they’ve changed in their own processes, and what today’s best founders are demanding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Data, Data Everywhere:</strong> As companies struggle to manage and share increasingly large amounts of data, it’s no wonder that Databricks, whose primary product is a data lake house, was valued at a whopping $38 billion for its most recent funding round. We’re going to talk to CEO Ali Ghodsi about why his startup is so hot and what comes next.</p>
<p><strong>AI Ethics at Enterprise Scale:</strong> Keeping AI models fair and unbiased is a tough enough job in the lab or with a single product. How can it be accomplished at the scale of business being done by Amazon and Salesforce? Amazon AI Applied Science manager Nashlie Sephus and Principle Architect of AI Practice Kathy Baxter will discuss the responsibilities as opportunities of putting ethical practices to work in enterprise applications.</p>
<p><strong>Nine Security Tips for Startups:</strong> When startups are in the beginning stages of growth, it becomes harder to balance between taking necessary security measures and bringing the product to market. You don’t want to slow iteration speed, but you also know that there are security steps that need to happen in order to grow the business. How do you balance these competing objectives? Christina Cacioppo, co-founder and CEO of Vanta, shares nine practical tips for building your product with security in mind and how to engage in conversations around security expectations from the start. Presented by Vanta.</p>
<p><strong>Building a Hypergrowth SaaS Startup in a Remote World:</strong> It’s hard to stand out in today’s startup market, given the sheer number of companies building, launching, and fundraising. But despite all the busyness, Workboard has made waves. Competing in a crowded niche, Deidre Paknad’s upstart tech company has posted huge growth despite COVID-19’s disruptions. We’ll sit down with the CEO to dig into how she managed to scale her company in both revenue, and human terms, despite the global pandemic. Founders, expect to learn something!</p>
<p>That should get your SaaS motor running, and of course there’s so much more waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=tomorrowpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tomorrowpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are looking to double down on their bets on DealShare, becoming the latest high-profile investors to go all-in on India&#8217;s nascent but growing social commerce trend.</p>
<p>The two firms, both of which are already an investor in Jaipur-headquartered startup (AWI, which is managed by Falcon, is an early investor in DealShare), are in advanced stages of talks to co-lead a financing round of over $225 million in DealShare, three sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The talks propose giving DealShare a valuation of over $1.7 billion, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. The round will likely see some early investors and founders selling as much as $60 million worth of shares, the people said. DealShare, which has raised $183 million in its previous financing rounds, was valued at $455 million (post-money) in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/indian-social-commerce-dealshare-raises-144-million-eyes-international-expansion/">Series D round three months ago</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>DealShare and one of its co-founders didn’t respond to a request for comment. Tiger Global declined to comment.</p>
<p>The startup had preliminary talks with a number of other investors including Coatue Management, according to a source familiar with the matter. Coatue Management declined to comment.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when the trend of social commerce has taken off in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. Indian social commerce startup Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/">recently secured $570 million in a round</a>. (Meesho, which counts SoftBank, B Capital, and Prosus Ventures among its investors, is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-in-talks-to-invest-in-facebook-backed-indian-social-commerce-meesho/">raise over $50 million from Google</a>, TechCrunch reported last week.) Flipkart, India&#8217;s largest e-commerce firm, recently forayed into the social commerce category and said it is aiming to tap over 25 million merchants on its platform by next year.</p>
<p>Even as Amazon and Flipkart have been able to create a sizable market in the urban Indian cities, much of the nation remains still underserved. DealShare, which began as an e-commerce platform on WhatsApp, where it offered hundreds of products to consumers, is attempting to reach consumers in smaller Indian cities and towns. The startup says customers on its platform buy curated items in groups, which makes purchases “highly competitive” in affordability. The average cart size on DealShare is between $16 to $19, the startup said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup offers “high-quality, low-priced essentials coupled with a gamified, fun and virality-driven vernacular shopping experience that makes it easy for first-time internet users to experience online shopping,” its executives have said in past interviews. The community purchasing, they said, enables “ultra-low-cost delivery mechanism” and ensures “best-in-class unit economics.”</p>
<p>DealShare has recently aggressively expanded its private label brands, through which it sells a range of items including rice and pulse, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company closed last year with $2 billion in GMV and is on target to do close to $6 billion this year. To maintain its status as a global leader, that meant going after some new capital.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.logicbroker.com/">Logicbroker</a>, a Connecticut-based e-commerce company focused on cloud fulfillment, secured a $135 million growth round from K1 Investment Management.</p>
<p>Its software provides drop ship and marketplace automation capabilities to brands, retailers, suppliers and third-party logistics providers. As CEO Peyman Zamani explained it, “drop ship” is a way that packages get from the seller to the buyer.</p>
<p>For example, Walgreens is one of the Logicbroker’s customers, and if you purchased a bottle of Walgreens brand vitamins from the website, it might get to you from a company warehouse, shipped directly from the provider or from a third-party, but the item you receive will be branded Walgreens. Drop ship can also happen in-store: say you see a dress you like, but the retailer only has the blue one available and you want it in red. The store can order it and send it to you or you can pick it up in the store.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zamani, who was previously an executive at Office Depot, says this kind of technology started about 30 years ago when the concept of electronic data interchange — businesses communicating information, like purchase orders and invoices, electronically versus on paper — began to become mainstream.</p>
<p>“Electronic data interchange is now at the heart of e-commerce,” he added. “The concept today is the same, but what I envisioned was this taking place in the cloud, but no one was focusing on the connectivity and automation in a scalable way.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223705" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223705" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png" alt="Logicbroker" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png 1984w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=1536,871 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potal-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223705" class="wp-caption-text">Logicbroker portal</p></div></p>
<p>He founded Logicbroker in 2010, his third startup, and hadn’t raised much in the way of venture capital since 2013, just under $2 million, to get to profitability, Zamani said. Logicbroker hit that milestone about six years ago, and is growing about 80% year over year in revenue. It expanded into five global regions and works with over 4,000 companies, including Mars Wrigley and Samsung, to manage more than $5 billion in gross merchandise value annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the years, investors were knocking on the door, and Zamani was always “respectfully declining,” that is, until this year. The company closed out last year with approximately $2 billion in GMV and is on target to do close to $6 billion this year. In order to be a powerhouse and global leader in drop ship, Logicbroker wanted to accelerate product features, which meant going after some capital.</p>
<p>“We had eight offers, but picked K1 because they only invest in SaaS companies and look for category leader,” Zamani said. “We were already there in the U.S and want to repeat that globally. We could have gotten there ourselves, but it would have taken five to 10 years. Now we can get there in a couple of years.”</p>

<p>The new funding will go toward adding to its 65-person employee base, the global expansion and continued product development. Logicbroker launched its curated marketplace this year with half a dozen customers and intends to make it one of the company’s leading offerings over the next four quarters.</p>
<p>Simon Yu, senior vice president at K1, said via email he reached out to Zamani a few years ago when the firm saw that Logicbroker “was building something unique in the e-commerce space.” In speaking with the company’s customers, Yu said they told K1 how much “they loved the products and thought the team was building an innovative platform that had a direct positive impact on revenue.”</p>
<p>He believes digitalization of global e-commerce is still in the early stages, and behavior, like drop shipping, will become more prevalent over time.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 definitely accelerated some of that,” he added. “Logicbroker is fueling this transformation and we’re excited to work with Peyman and the Logicbroker team on building a category leader.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mallorie Brodie and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Lauren Lake founded </span><a href="http://gobridgit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in late 2012 with the mission of helping construction companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maximize profits “by taking a people-first approach.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Over the years, the pair say they spoke with hundreds of contractors and construction executives to better understand how technology could make them successful. Strategic workforce planning was a recurring theme, in addition to the need to forecast future staffing demands and “collaborative” access to people and project data, according to Brodie.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223729" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup launched its first product, Bridgit Field, in March 2014. In 2019, it brought its second product, Bridgit Bench, to market. Built for construction workforce planning, cloud-based Bench has become Bridgit’s flagship offering. This is not shocking considering the widespread labor shortage the industry has been experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bench aims to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help general contractors plan and grow their workforce, leverage project data to improve bidding and staffing decisions and forecast project pipelines. The end result, Bridgit claims, is increased productivity and profitability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General contractors are in the business of managing risk — ensuring you have the right people on the right project in order to reduce risk is difficult at the best of times,” Brodie said. “Up until now, general contractors had no better option than to complete their people-planning</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">efforts in spreadsheets. That’s a manual lift, and often more of a reactive than proactive process. Given the added pressures of the labor shortage that the industry is facing, building a proactive ‘people strategy’ is top of mind for builders across North America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bench is also a big reason why Bridgit has raised its latest round. In July of 2020, publicly traded construction design software giant Autodesk led a CAD$9 million round into Bridgit. Since then, the company has increased its headcount from 46 to 83 while</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its revenue has surged by 140%, according to Lake. During that same time frame, Bridgit has onboarded 58 new customers, including Clayco, The Walsh Group and Hoffman Construction, with enterprise-wide agreements signed with Skanska, Ryan Companies and Alberici-Flintco. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting shift to digital had an impact as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once the pandemic hit, construction companies were forced to bring any remaining paper-based processes online, which led to a surge in usage of our workforce planning platform,” Lake told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly toward building out its team, product development and doubling down on its go-to-market strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The construction tech market is exploding and for good reason,” said investor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arun Penmetsa of Storm Ventures, who took a seat on Bridgit’s board as part of the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgit, he said, acts as a unifying layer for an organization’s data and provides “unprecedented visibility” into its people and projects, along with the appropriate workflows to support analytics, compliance and prediction, Penmetsa said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is really no one out there doing what they are doing, and most organizations rely on Excel,” he said. “Bridgit’s approach is fundamentally different compared to other companies in the space.”</span></p>
<p><em>This story was updated post-publication to reflect that the round was raised in Canadian dollars</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Midwest could sustain its results at present levels. If that comes to pass, the region would no longer be a place to fly over, but a location to Zoom into.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It felt like something of a coming-of-age party for the Chicago startup scene, a city that has long held a leading position in the larger Midwest market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/chicagos-sprout-social-prices-ipo-mid-range-at-17-per-share-raising-150m/">when Sprout Social went public</a>.</p>
<p>The company would go on to become a breakout IPO success, pricing at $17 per share in the closing days of 2019 to a value of more than $123 per share today.</p>
<p>Sprout has put together a $6.6 billion company, mostly outside of the normal Silicon Valley headline mill. But its success is not singular. Instead, Sprout’s IPO was more akin to the opening shot of a starter pistol.</p>
<p>Since 2019, according to <a href="https://blog.midweststartups.com/2021-best-of-the-midwest-startup-cities-rankings-95de17d13760">data compiled by a Midwest venture capital firm</a>, capital invested in the region has effectively doubled, from around $10 billion in the 12-month periods ending June 2019 and 2020 to $20 billion in the year concluding June 2021.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Other notable successes have cropped up more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/">including Duolingo’s IPO this year</a>, taking the Pittsburgh-based edtech company public at a valuation that now just tips past the $7 billion mark.</p>
<p>This year has proved lucrative for Midwest startups. A few data points make the trends clear. Per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">CB Insights venture data through Q3 of this year</a>, Denver-based startups have raised about $3.1 billion in total venture capital. In all of 2020, that figure was $2.7 billion, and we still have a full quarter of data missing from this year’s tally.</p>
<p>Chicago is a similar story, with $4.9 billion raised through Q3 2021, per CB Insights, compared to $3.1 billion raised in all of 2020. Midwest cities are crushing their 2020 venture capital tallies, results that were at times already at or near record highs.</p>

Today, however, given how strong the year is shaping up in general terms, we wanted to advance our understanding not of what is merely driving the boom in funding activity for Midwest startups, but what impacts the rush of capital is having on startups in the region.</p>
<p>We put questions to a number of area startup CEOs (from Beam Dental, Azumo, NanoGraf, Total Expert and Oculii) and Midwest-focused venture capitalist <a href="https://twitter.com/dmikeasem">Mike Asem</a>, asking how the pandemic has shuffled the domestic startup talent market and more.</p>
<p>The resulting picture is one that could indicate that recent strength in the region in terms of attracting capital to fund local upstarts may have the momentum to continue.</p>
<p>For the Midwest, then, long a somewhat overlooked region of startup activity, the future could be one of sustained results at present levels. If that comes to pass, the Midwest would no longer be a place to fly over, but a location to Zoom into. But as we’ll see; not every blessing is without costs, and what’s allowing the Midwest to put up more points may at times be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Let’s explore.</p>
<h2>The talent wars</h2>
<p>Sticking to the double-edged concept, it’s a well-worn trope by now that investing over Zoom has changed where many venture capitalists put their dollars to work. That means good things <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">for India’s startups,</a> as well as those in the U.S. Midwest, as investors not traditionally located in those areas may now be more open to investing afield from their IRL HQ.</p>
<p>The talent market is undergoing similar changes. With Zoom and related technologies allowing for more remote hiring, the global war for talent is now just that: global.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AlexFrommeyer">Alex Frommeyer</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.beam.dental/">Beam Dental</a> (more than $168 million raised, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beam-technologies">per Crunchbase</a>, with its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio), said in an email that the national talent market has “changed a lot since COVID, as more coastal companies have started to compete for top Midwestern talent for the first time with remote positions.”</p>
<p>After noting that he moved his company to Columbus to secure “access to a specific profile of talent, namely the mix of insurance and tech talent,” Frommeyer added that the city has “gotten more competitive” from a talent perspective, as “arguably the startup scene is growing even faster than the city.”</p>

Project Mic, as the app is currently known, will reportedly focus on the US market at first, though the launch timeline is not clear.</p>
<p>Creators will be able to play songs from the vast <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-spatial-audio-headphones-ios-android-dolby-atmos-sony-360-reality-audio-142301483.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>Amazon Music</ins></a> library, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22744585/amazon-project-mic-launch-live-audio-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. Along with music, it seems programming will include pop culture, sports and comedy. Amazon is said to be looking at bringing in celebrities and influencers to host shows. You’ll be able to search for shows by name, topic or music, and it appears Amazon will highlight live content, including trending topics and certain creators.</p>
<p>The presentation showed that in addition to the app, creators will be able to broadcast shows on Amazon Music, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>Twitch</ins></a>, Audible and Alexa-enabled devices.

<p>The report doesn’t mention whether listeners will need to be Amazon Music subscribers, but given the breadth of platforms on which the shows will be available, that seems unlikely. Engadget has contacted Amazon for more details.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time we’ve heard about Amazon working on such an app. <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-clubhouse-clone-leaked-163829793.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>reported on its existence</ins></a> this summer, but this latest report provides more details about what Project Mic entails.</p>

<p>Spotify does have a morning show called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-launching-its-first-fm-radiolike-music-and-talk-morning-show-120032078.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>The Get Up</ins></em></a> that blends chat and personalized music, and it seems the most likely contender to offer a similar feature to what Amazon has in mind.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/fitness-plus-introduces-workouts-and-meditations-with-shareplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> a new way for Fitness+ users to work out or meditate with people in other locations through group workouts powered by SharePlay. The tech giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-adds-fitness-updates-including-a-group-workout-feature/">teased</a> the feature at its September 14 virtual event.</p>
<p>Fitness+ subscribers can use SharePlay to start a group workout or meditation session with up to 32 other people while using FaceTime on an iPhone or iPad. The Fitness+ session will stream completely in sync for everyone on the call.</p>
<p>To begin a group session, users need to start a FaceTime call and navigate to the Fitness+ app. From there, you can select a workout and get started. SharePlay also works with Apple TV so users can follow the workout on a larger screen while staying connected with their friends on FaceTime through their iPhone or iPad.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224079" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple notes that when you work out in a group through SharePlay, you’ll see their metrics and progress toward closing their Activity rings. When someone closes their Activity rings during a workout, everyone in the session will be notified.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fitness+ will be available in 15 new countries on November 3, including Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. Fitness+ will be available in English, with subtitles in Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish.</p>
<p>The service is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the U.K. With this upcoming expansion, Fitness+ will be available in 21 countries in total.</p>
<p>Apple also says that ​​beginning November 1, 2021, around 3 million fully insured UnitedHealthcare members in the U.S. will be able to enroll with Apple Fitness+ for a year-long subscription, at no additional cost as part of their plan benefits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitness+ is also introducing a new episode of its Time to Walk series, which is an immersive audio walking experience, with actor and disability advocate Marilee Talkington. In this episode, she talks about defying expectations and how she helps empower others to do the same.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-fitness-launches-on-december-14/">launched</a> Fitness+ on December 14, 2021, and has since worked to compete with other subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Fitness+ is available as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standalone subscription</a> for $9.99 per month, or as a part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple One Premier</a> plan for $29.95 per month, which gives users access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud+ with 2TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://crossbeam.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crossbeam</a> founder and CEO Bob Moore founded his startup to help companies building sales partnerships understand their overlapping accounts, using a process called account mapping. He knew that eventually the company would benefit from a network effect as customers attracted other partners to the network. As that vision has come to fruition, it has caught the attention of investors and today the company announced a $76 million Series C.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz led the round, with participation from prior round lead investors Redpoint Ventures, FirstMark Capital, First Round Capital and Uncork Capital, along with Salesforce Ventures, HubSpot Ventures and Okta Ventures. The company has now raised almost $117 million with today&#8217;s investment, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crossbeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>.</p>
<p>Moore says that the network effect was what is attracting investors and it provides an easy way for the company and its investors to measure success by looking at the network graph. &#8220;So all the ways that we think about if the business is working and how we measure success tends to revolve around the growth in this network graph and how many new companies are coming on board,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224064" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because many of these companies joined because they were recruited by other companies. They also can look at how deeply engaged they are in terms of using the platform and how they are collaborating across company lines, he explained. When you look at the growth from inception today, you can see that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224065" style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224065" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2224065" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CrossbeamGrowth-Small.gif?w=479" alt="Crossbeam network growth since inception." width="479" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224065" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Crossbeam</p></div></p>
<p>Further, over the last year, they have been attracting much larger companies, which has grown the network even faster. &#8220;One of the biggest changes in the last year is that we started landing very large enterprise accounts that have these really amazing ecosystems that almost serve as their own centers of gravity [in the partnership graph],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that early on they were selling to partner teams, but now they are also moving into sales and marketing and that&#8217;s helping feed valuable data into systems like Salesforce and HubSpot (which not coincidentally are also investors). &#8220;That wider interest is driven by these integrations into products like Salesforce and HubSpot and Slack where the data can flow into where people are doing their work and actually allow them to get the answers to these questions and measure where the impact is coming from in their partner ecosystems.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s only when companies start putting Crossbeam data to work that they start paying. &#8220;We have a freemium model, so you can join for free, you can have unlimited partners for free and you can connect all your data for free. The point at which you start paying is when you want to take the data that you&#8217;ve been able to acquire through Crossbeam and have it exit the Crossbeam system and go out into another platform [like Salesforce],&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>So far that network has grown to 5,000 companies. He says that about 20% of participants have become paying customers, which is a pretty standard ratio. Today, the company has around 65 employees, with plans to get to 80 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>When we spoke to Moore at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/crossbeam-announces-25m-series-b-to-keep-growing-partnerships-platform/">the company&#8217;s $25 million Series B</a> in August 2020, he talked about diversity and inclusion as part of the entire recruiting process and the culture he and the executive team are trying to create at the company &#8212; and he says that has continued as the company has grown.</p>
<p>&#8220;We talk about it openly and regularly in our executive team meetings. We have a diversity, equity and inclusion committee internally that is responsible for internal cultural efforts and checks and balances on all of our own processes, which is made up of a diverse array of employees. I think the bottom line is that our diversity numbers and representation among all ranks of the company has held up or gotten even better since the time of the Series B,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He adds that even in a tight employment market, they have been able to attract talent because people want to work at a company that is growing quickly and attracting investors as Crossbeam is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a B2B company that feels almost like a consumer business in some ways because of all these network effects…and we have a great story to tell and the company is growing very rapidly. We have amazing investors and it shows in the data and we&#8217;re very transparent culturally about how things are going,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The labor market is changing. More workers expect to keep working in a remote manner, even if many large employers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578804/apple-employees-work-from-home-request-denied-hybrid-model">reticent to support the movement</a>. The longer the pandemic drags on, the more it appears that work will look quite different in the future. As TechCrunch has reported, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/the-remote-work-argument-has-already-been-won-by-startups/">startups have already cast their lots in with a remote future</a>, often building their early teams across time zones and geographies.</p>
<p>The trend is pronounced enough that we&#8217;re seeing private tech companies get acquisitive to better support it. This morning, for example, payroll and HR provider <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a> announced that it is buying <a href="https://www.remoteteam.com/">Remote Team</a>, a startup that focuses on supporting far-flung staff.</p>
<p>As part of its news item, Gusto also announced that it now supports paying contractors in 80 countries and quick tax registration in all 50 American states.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223817" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Remote Team, unlike Gusto, is an early-stage startup. Crunchbase has but a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/remoteteam/company_financials">dusting of data</a> regarding its history and capital raises, for example. In the view of <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuareeves">Gusto CEO Josh Reeves</a>, Remote Team was at around the Series A stage of startup life. Putting current fundraising trends aside, that means that the smaller firm likely had customers and a go-to-market motion that was just hitting its stride.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gusto has raised nearly $700 million in capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gusto/company_financials">again according to Crunchbase data</a>, most recently <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hr-software-company-gusto-raises-144746285.html">adding $175 million to its accounts at a valuation of just under $9.5 billion</a>. Gusto is, therefore, in the current parlance, essentially a decacorn.</p>
<p>Or, as we like to think of it at TechCrunch, a company that should go public.</p>
<p>Regardless of our views of the current late-stage unicorn market, Gusto could offer Remote Team something that simply raising more capital could not, namely scale. Per Remote Team <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahinboydas/">CEO and founder Sahin Boydas</a>, selling his company to Gusto made sense because it could offer more reach into the global corporate footprint than raising oodles more private funds would allow the startup on its own.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boydas indicated that support for more countries is coming, implying that Gusto&#8217;s ability to support international hires will only grow in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>Terms of the transactions were not disclosed, but Gusto&#8217;s CEO did indicate that equity was a component of the transaction. Translating that a little, the deal was executed in both stock and cash. Regarding the latter element, Reeves told TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s Series E earlier this year was not put together to fund the company&#8217;s day-to-day operations; Gusto still had most of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">its preceding round in the bank</a>. You raise extra capital when you can, and, we&#8217;d add, when you want to buy some smaller companies that have tech or staff that you want to tack on to your current business.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d not be utterly shocked if Gusto bought another company or two before it goes public. (The company has now purchased three smaller firms, counting Remote Team. The previous two were Ardius and Symmetry, for those curious.)</p>
<p>On that front, Gusto said that it is growing at around 50% per year, but didn&#8217;t share more than that. TechCrunch pressed Reeves on the lack of details regarding its financial performance, essentially curious why he won&#8217;t share more at this juncture given that we expect to be able to look back at this period when his company goes public. As with every CEO we put that question to, the answer was polite.</p>
<p>Summing: Gusto&#8217;s small and midsized business focus doesn&#8217;t preclude it from seeing demand for more international and interstate hiring, so it&#8217;s tooling its service to meet the need. It will prove interesting to see how the larger Gusto-versus-Rippling rivalry bears out. The two companies have a history of not getting along, and Rippling recently put together its own mega-round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/parker-conrads-rippling-is-now-valued-at-6-5-billion-more-than-zenefits-at-its-peak/">adding $250 million to its coffers at a $6.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;re curious if Gusto and related private technology companies get into the corporate spend game, another corner of the startup work that is awash in both venture capital and market demand. You can see the synergies somewhat easily; Gusto wants to help SMBs start and run their businesses regardless of where they or their workers are based. And if Gusto is going to help make payroll work for those firms, why not add in another category of spend to the mix?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“The Ruin stirs, and the Five Realms rumble,” a now-archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211020203838/https://www.realmsofruin.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web announcement</a> read on Thursday morning. “You are cordially invited to join New York Times bestselling and award-winning authors Marie Lu, Tahereh Mafi, Ransom Riggs, Adam Silvera, David Yoon, and Nicola Yoon in Realms of Ruin, a collaborative fantasy epic filled with dark magic, intrigue, and unique characters &#8212; launched online in a thrilling new way.”</p>
<p>These celebrated young adult authors shared the announcement across social media, opening a Twitter, Instagram and Discord server for fans to discuss the buzzy new project that would propel the traditional publishing industry into the new territory of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/what-is-web3-disrupt-ben-rubin/">Web3</a>, an evolution of the decentralized internet that emphasizes privacy, data ownership and compensation for work &#8212; maybe even fan-made creative works.</p>
<p>As the catalyst for this collaborative fantasy epic, these authors would post 12 initial origin stories about their fictional universe, to which they owned the copyright. Then fans would be tasked with writing their own stories, submitting them to the Realms of Ruin universe by minting them as NFTs on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana blockchain</a>. If the authors were to enjoy a fan’s story enough, they could declare it part of the project’s official canon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223512" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Within hours, fans confronted the authors in the Discord server with their concerns about the project. If the authors are inviting fans to write fan fiction about a universe they created, who owns the derivative works? Does minting those stories as NFTs affect the copyright of those stories? And how are these concerns exacerbated given that these authors’ target audience is too young to buy cryptocurrency on platforms like Coinbase and Gemini?</p>
<p>Rebecca Tushnet, the Frank Stanton Professor of First Amendment Law at Harvard Law School, aptly summed up the situation. “It’s a turducken of things people don’t understand,” she said. In other words, on top of the usual NFT concerns, the team would also be facing copyright questions and confronting the historical hesitancy from fan fiction writers over monetization of their works in a commercial environment.<em> </em></p>
<p>Along with a team of nine developers, the six young adult authors spent two months working nights and weekends to bring Realms of Ruin to life. Within hours of its announcement, the project garnered so much backlash that they pulled the plug.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to a source with intimate knowledge of the Realms of Ruin project who requested anonymity. They said that the authors, who also worked with a team of developers, ended the project because they felt that there was more to lose than there was to gain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish we could pretend this doesn&#39;t exist but everyone subtweeting and asking if it&#39;s true only adds to the hype, so&#8211;yes. It&#39;s real.

<p>&mdash; Amanda Woody <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f383.png" alt="🎃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@AmandaWoody_) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaWoody_/status/1450874823802982404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The project ultimately imploded due to a combination of factors. The targeted demographic had concerns over the environmental impacts related to minting NFTs, but they also didn&#8217;t fully understand how NFTs worked. Plus, various key elements of the project were poorly thought through in advance of the project&#8217;s announcement. And fans were worried about the legal ramifications of attempting to monetize their fan fiction.</p>
<h2>An emerging tech dystopia</h2>
<p>Young adult readers are often drawn to dystopian stories &#8212; like those from Realms of Ruin participants Marie Lu and Tahereh Mafi &#8212; which reflect their current anxieties about their existing reality, including climate change. Lu&#8217;s books, which are set in the future, foreshadow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/uns-ipcc-report-on-climate-change-sounds-code-red-for-planet/">impending climate catastrophe</a>, so her readers are clued into the discussions around the environmental cost of minting NFTs.</p>
<p>Blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin can be less efficient because both networks are validated using &#8220;proof of work,&#8221; an algorithm that verifies the legitimacy of a transaction by solving energy-intensive math puzzles.</p>
<p>So there’s cognitive dissonance to scrolling through Twitter, seeing posts about uptick in the frequency of natural disasters interspersed among news about how people are buying expensive JPGs through an energy-intensive crypto transaction that uses enough electricity to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power an American home</a> for almost a week. Yet Realms of Ruin downplayed those concerns by touting its use of the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>“Realms of Ruin is built on Solana to ensure low transaction costs and minimal environmental impact,” the project’s website read, before it was taken offline. “In fact, in the time you spent reading this, your body has burnt more calories in energy than it takes to mint a story on the Solana blockchain!”</p>
<p>Unlike NFTs minted on Ethereum today, transaction fees for minting an NFT on Solana can be <a href="https://solanabeach.io/transactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than a cent</a>. Austin Federa, the head of Communications at Solana Labs, a developer of the Solana blockchain, told TechCrunch that boiling an ounce of water from room temperature takes more energy than minting an NFT on Solana. This is partially because Solana relies on a &#8220;proof of stake&#8221; algorithm, which requires less energy to validate than proof of work. But it&#8217;s not clear the teenaged fans fully understood the difference between blockchains, based on a number of tweets we viewed about the project following its announcement, which compared minting NFTs to burning the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>This lack of understanding encapsulates a larger issue that crypto has to solve, which is how to make itself more comprehensible to the general public.</p>
<p class="p1">“NFTs have either been something that sells for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/"><span class="s1">$69 million at Christie&#8217;s</span></a>, or they’re a very crypto-native thing,” Federa told TechCrunch. “I was really excited about Realms of Ruin because they were trying to bridge that gap a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Lack of planning, explanations raised concerns</h2>
<p>Another issue that arose was a misunderstanding over NFT &#8220;gas fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s standard to pay a gas fee to mint an NFT. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-nft-on-ramp-is-still-too-steep/">higher costs</a> of minting on the Ethereum blockchain still pose a serious barrier to entry, minting on the Solana blockchain can cost just pennies. Federa added that the entire Solana network is designed to keep fees low in the long term. But since a gas fee transaction would be involved in adding an installment to the Realms of Ruin universe, a misconception circulated among fans that they would have to pay the authors to write fan fiction, when really the fees were a part of minting on the blockchain.</p>
<p>As vibrant fan communities thrive online for free &#8212; often with little intervention from the author of the source material &#8212; this implication was concerning.</p>
<p>“I think NFTs are just a very new misunderstood market, and I feel that it’s really hard to step back and explain it,” said Megan Manzano, a literary agent working with young adult authors who voiced<a href="https://twitter.com/Megan_Manzano/status/1450902663302950913" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> concerns about Realms of Ruin</a> on Twitter. “It just felt like it could’ve been more thought out, or even if they just had a prepared facts section somewhere&#8230; I felt like there were just a lot of questions that could have been pre-answered.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There was also confusion over Realms of Ruin&#8217;s plan to sell character NFTs as collectibles. The marketing of the project made it unclear how these digital goods intersected with the collaborative storytelling aspect.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s source said that the character NFTs were intended to be marketed toward people already onboarded into the crypto sphere, and the profits would go toward a “community treasury,” which would be used to benefit the community by subsidizing gas fees, offering crypto incentives for the best stories or anything else the community decided. But some fans believed that they would have to collect the character NFTs in order to be able to write about those characters, and the project’s developers didn’t do a good job at communicating that this wasn’t the case on the Realms of Ruin website.</p>
<p>The element of a community treasury was poorly explained too, the source admits.</p>
<p>“In time, the community will decide when and how to use the treasury. We will be sure to work out a structure on how we can make such decisions,” one developer said on Discord.</p>
<p>“This community is currently effectively just this discord, are you saying if we all decided that all proceeds of the treasury would be donated to UNICEF then that’s what you’d do?” a fan asked.</p>
<p>“Honestly (with a bit more complexity) yes,” the developer responded. “It’s clear we don’t have all the answers you’re looking for yet, so we will work to get these for you,” the developer said.</p>
<p>Fans pointed out that it seemed irresponsible not to have these answers at the time of the announcement. Our source, however, pointed out that the project was set to launch on November 8, and that this announcement was supposed to be a teaser, rather than a complete rollout.</p>
<h2>Fan fiction, ownership and NFTs</h2>
<p>Fan fiction is a tricky, yet fertile ground for legal questions about copyright and ownership.</p>
<p>Sometimes, top fan fiction writers can even parlay their online success into real publishing careers. If a writer can capture the interest of tens of thousands of readers online, it’s not unreasonable to believe that, with original characters and an original story, they could do the same on The New York Times bestsellers list.</p>
<p>One recent example of this phenomenon is Tamsyn Muir’s “Gideon the Ninth,” published in 2019, which The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/books/review/otherworldly-science-fiction-fantasy-amal-el-mohtar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> &#8220;a devastating debut that deserves every ounce of hype it’s received.” But Muir <a href="https://tazmuir.tumblr.com/post/188513057993/hi-youve-mentioned-several-times-in-interviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t secretive</a> that she got her start writing fan fiction. Another unabashed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/10/how-fanfiction-improves-writing/599197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proponent of fan fiction</a> is N.K. Jemisin, a MacArthur Foundation “Genius Grant” awardee who is also the only writer to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Novel three years in a row. From a revenue standpoint, E.L. James&#8217; &#8220;Fifty Shades of Grey&#8221; series might be the best example of how a writer can start their career by posting derivative stories online &#8212; before the series was an international hit, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fifty-shades-of-grey-started-out-as-twilight-fan-fiction-2015-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was Twilight fan fiction</a>.</p>
<p>But monetizing fan fiction through online platforms is a trickier matter. For example, when Tumblr announced it would roll out Post+, a paid subscription product, the company <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/post/657323537298833408/hi-there-as-you-might-have-noticed-were#notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used fan fiction writers </a>as an example of a content creator who could profit from the product. This caused concern among writers who worried that putting a derivative work behind a paywall could land them in legal trouble.</p>
<p>“My main concern was that [the Realms of Ruin project&#8217;s creators] were asking their audience to come in and write a bunch of stuff, and they would then select things to be canon in their world. And the tricky part of this is that they already made this world and copyrighted it,” said Manzano. She said it wasn&#8217;t clear if the fan fiction writers would be able to do anything more with their work or if they would be acknowledged or compensated for creating it.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s source close to the project feels differently. Although the six established authors own the Realms of Ruin copyright (at least according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211020203838/https://www.realmsofruin.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the archived version of the website</a>), writers can be paid to participate in larger publishing projects where they don’t have ownership in the franchise. Over 850 “Star Trek” novels have been published, for example, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that those authors own the rights to &#8220;Star Trek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harvard Law professor Rebecca Tushnet &#8212; who is a member of the legal team at the Organization for Transformative Works, which runs major fan fiction site <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive of Our Own</a> &#8212; said that these questions would depend on what the actual contract is between Realms of Ruin and the writers.</p>
<p>“If they’re giving permission, there aren’t copyright infringement questions, there are ownership questions. And those would be navigated by contract. But the thing that you usually expect is that the people writing the fan works might have limited rights,” she told TechCrunch. Because the Realms of Ruin project was shut down before it officially launched, contract details weren&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>“The fan fiction part is probably the least interesting part about this,” added Tushnet. “It’s not unknown for authors to say, ‘I want to authorize you to play in my world, and you can even have some of the money.’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/22/amazon-debuts-kindle-worlds-where-your-gossip-girl-fan-fiction-can-earn-you-cash/">Kindle Worlds</a> was an attempt at this, but it ultimately did not seem to be profitable, and Amazon shut it down.”</p>
<p>Fan creators are generally skeptical of projects like Kindle Worlds since they can seem like thinly veiled ways for corporations to profit off of these communities. This mistrust goes back years to the founding of <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive of Our Own.</a></p>
<p>In 2006, a platform called FanLib raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fanlib/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million</a> in venture capital to launch a platform where copyright owners (like ViacomCBS, which owns &#8220;Star Trek&#8221;) could host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070819022752/http://startrek.fanlib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan fiction contests</a> to engage fans. But existing fan fiction writers criticized FanLib for requiring that all submitters, even ones who didn’t win the contest, <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/FanLib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forfeit the rights</a> to their work, allowing it to be used for commercial purposes. Even though these fan fiction writers obviously didn’t own the copyright to &#8220;Star Trek,&#8221; it’s still important to these creators to own the actual words that they put on the page, as well as the ability to decide if they want ViacomCBS to commercialize their work or not.</p>
<p>The controversy around FanLib sparked speculative fiction author Naomi Novik &#8212; who also openly writes fan fiction &#8212; to pen <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/An_Archive_Of_One%27s_Own_(post_by_astolat)">a landmark blog post</a> in 2007 under her internet pseudonym, proposing the project that would become Archive of Our Own, an ad-free, donation-supported platform run by and for fan fiction writers that states fan fiction’s case for legality up front. By 2008, FanLib was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/disney-buying-storytelling-social-net-fanlib-digisynd-in-process/">sold to Disney</a>, which shut the site down soon after.</p>
<p>Today, Archive of Our Own<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072622/fanfic-ao3-free-speech-censorship-fandom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> prohibits its users</a> from linking to sites like Patreon or Ko-Fi to solicit tips to keep writers protected from copyright complaints that could arise from monetization efforts.</p>
<p>“The attempt to monetize fan fiction often creates a lot of controversy,” Tushnet noted. “To the extent that they want to encourage vibrant fan communities, it turns out that one of the most successful solutions over time is to let the fan community do its thing and actually limit the interactions that you have. That seems to create the healthiest situations for fandoms, and for the authors that create the works that generate the fandom.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s source with knowledge of the project explained that the decision to build Realms of Ruin on a blockchain was because the technology would have enabled a new way for fan fiction writers to get paid for their work while still being able to retain credit for its creation, and do so in a legal manner.</p>
<p>On the blockchain, you could more easily track the lineage of how stories influenced one another other, allowing writers to credit one another for inspiring their work. So, if someone wrote a response to someone’s story, and the NFT representing their story was purchased for a high value, then the writer who inspired it would get a cut, too. Another appeal of NFTs for artists is that every time an NFT is sold, the original creator still gets a cut. This is different from how sales work in the existing art world. If an artist sells a painting for $100, and the buyer later resells it for $1,000, the artist won’t see any more royalties, unless they had a contract outlining their right to a percentage of the sale.</p>
<p>However, Tushnet argues that the use of the blockchain alone isn&#8217;t enough to solve the pressing legal questions over derivative works.</p>
<p>“The people who are into NFTs think they’ve solved some new problem, but they really haven’t. All of the interesting legal questions, their relationship to the NFT is accidental at most. Real-world law will decide what the copyright questions are,” Tushnet said. “There’s just nothing new about this. Authors used to send manuscripts on boats across the ocean, and we had to figure out which country’s laws applied.”</p>

<h2>The ruins</h2>
<p>In the end, Realms of Ruin was a project that only existed outside of the Wayback Machine for a few hours. But the catastrophe of it all shows what challenges will face Web3 evangelists when they try to sway communities that are rightfully skeptical about how the spirit of their existing internet communities will be protected.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the values of Web3 aren’t too different from a fan fiction mecca like Archive of Our Own &#8212; both seek to move beyond the existing model of an ad-supported internet, which offers free access in exchange for the monetization of our attention.</p>
<p>“We’re still in incredibly early days for this technology,” said Federa. He thinks that a lot of the blowback against Realms of Ruin was factually inaccurate due to consumers’ misunderstanding of blockchain-based projects. “But every project could do a better job explaining what crypto is, and why they choose to build on it.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s source with knowledge of Realms of Ruin said that it was probably too early to bring Web3 into the publishing world. Even as crypto thought-leaders wax poetic about the promise of an ad-free internet where creators are fairly compensated for their content, many people remain skeptical of the ecosystem. It’s hard to blame them for that when crypto communities can appear so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/">scammy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">male-dominated</a> and inaccessible from the outside.</p>
<p>“I think it’s way too early for this to be introduced,” said Manzano. “There would need to be a conversation about copyright, and what expectations, rights and merchandise would be linked with authors. I just worried that this would be an angle that could sort of get wishy-washy if certain rules and expectations weren’t laid out. It’s just way too new for publishing to have a certain grasp on it and how to properly integrate it into deals, merchandise and fan exposure.”</p>
<p>The source admitted that the developers and writers collaborating on the project hadn’t thought too far down that road yet &#8212; they hadn’t yet decided what would happen, for example, if a fan adapted their Realms of Ruin story into an original novel and sold it. The opaque nature of the Realms of Ruin rollout was perhaps a bigger kiss of death than aligning itself with crypto.</p>
<p>“I thought of myself as a teenager &#8212; if I saw some of my favorite authors creating something that I can be a part of, I would have jumped all over that,” said Manzano. “It just seemed like there were other ways to include fans and rally excitement that felt less sketchy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said it will install up to 40,000 electric vehicle chargers across North America as part of an ambitious plan to pour nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-is-upping-its-investment-in-charging-infrastructure-to-increase-confidence-in-evs/">$750 million into charging infrastructure</a> that will help attract drivers to its electrified models.</p>
<p>Under the program, GM will supply the charging equipment to auto dealers across the U.S. and Canada. Those dealers won’t deploy the chargers on their property &#8212; instead, they’ll work to identify suitable sites and get the infrastructure installed. GM will give each dealer up to 10 Ultium charging stations to deploy in their community. The automaker said it will also help dealers apply for incentives and other funding programs to install the chargers.</p>
<p>GM chose to partner with dealers under the plan — dubbed the Dealer Community Charging Program — because they’re often already engaged in their local area, Alex Keros, GM’s lead architect of EV infrastructure, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “Dealers are already pretty active in their communities, have great relationships, they know them well and so why not leverage them?”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new infrastructure will be called Ultium Chargers, so they&#8217;ll have clear GM branding, but unlike Tesla’s Supercharging network, GM&#8217;s 40,000 new Level 2 chargers will not be a proprietary network. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Keros indicated that the automaker has no interest in taking an exclusive network path to boosting sales of electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p>“Our view of the world is, ‘everybody in,’” he said. “We want to make sure that we’re growing the ocean.”</p>
<p>The automaker will also be rolling out three Ultium Level 2 smart chargers, for both home and commercial uses, that were developed and manufactured in partnership with EV charging company CTEK. Two of the units will be 11.5-kilowatt capacity, and the third will be a 19.2 kW unit best suited to deliver power to the forthcoming electric GMC Hummer or Cadillac Lyriq. These chargers will be used in the Dealer Community Charging Program, but they’ll also be suitable for residential use cases, Keros said.</p>
<p>The chargers will have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities; the more powerful unit will be outfitted with a customizable screen. The stations will also be able to load balance, meaning each unit can safely coordinate the flow of energy to the vehicle. For instance, when installed at a residence that might mean balancing the flow of electricity between the vehicle and other electrical home appliances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through GM’s Ultium Charge 360 app, customers will be able to get data on the charger status, set a charging schedule and view other statistics on charging habits and history. The app already lets drivers search for chargers across seven networks in North America, including Greenlots, Blink, FLO, ChargePoint, EVgo, EV Connect, Greenlots and SemaConnect. The automaker declined to provide further details on how the charging experience might differ between GM and non-GM cars, only that every EV would be compatible.</p>
<p>GM plans to make the charging units available next year, alongside the launch of the community charging program. Customers will be able to roll in the cost of a charger to their GM Financial lease or contract.</p>
<p>The automaker is moving swiftly as it zeroes in on its target of launching 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025, with plans to invest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion on EVs and automated technology</a> through that same year.</p>
<p>“When you look at the strong portfolio, the fact that we’re going to have affordable EVs, really affordable EVs for people and we’re also working on the ecosystem they need because for a lot of people it’s going to be their only vehicle — they need to have a reliable charging infrastructure,” chair and CEO Mary Barra said during a media briefing last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might have heard of &#8220;headless&#8221; content management systems, whereby you can run a CMS without being locked into a front-end platform. Well, a similar movement is coming to e-commerce.</p>
<p>The latest incarnation of this movement is the news that &#8220;headless checkout&#8221; startup <a href="http://rallyon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rally Commerce Inc.</a> has secured $6 million in seed funding. The wider idea here is to &#8220;decentralize&#8221; e-commerce ecosystems by allowing merchants to decouple themselves from the likes of Shopify, et al. There’s also a twist. Rally combines headless commerce with a Web3 token approach, which &#8212; they claim &#8212; will allow a merchant to &#8220;own&#8221; a piece of the network.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Felix Capital, alongside Rainfall Ventures, Long Journey Ventures, Afore Ventures and Commerce Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224076" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The team behind Rally previously built CartHook, a checkout solution.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HOXQlQ7XVG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/">Commercetools raises $140M at a $1.9B valuation as &#8216;headless&#8217; commerce continues to boom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commercetools raises $140M at a $1.9B valuation as &#8216;headless&#8217; commerce continues to boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/embed/#?secret=HOXQlQ7XVG" data-secret="HOXQlQ7XVG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rally says its checkout is platform-agnostic, allowing Merchants to replace their existing traditional checkouts with Rally’s, or build a headless experience, with Rally as the checkout and orchestration layer.</p>
<p>Jordan Gal, co-founder and CEO of Rally said: “Merchants are too often forced to accept the mediocre checkouts provided to them by underlying platforms, and app developers are subservient to the platforms they build for. We’re offering merchants a better conversion rate with higher average order value (AOV) and the freedom to build their businesses according to their needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>E-commerce is exploding post-pandemic after whole populations were forced onto online platforms, so anything e-commerce is obviously benefitting.</p>
<p>Joseph Pizzolato, investor, Felix Capital said: “The headless commerce space is booming as merchants and investors recognize the potential to create seamless and unique customer experiences across all touchpoints. Companies like CommerceTools, Nacelle, Fabric and Bolt are revolutionizing the old e-commerce stack, driving record funding inflows and sky-high valuations. We see Rally in the same category.”</p>
<p>For context, Commercetools — a provider of e-commerce APIs that larger retailers can use to build customized payment, check-out, social commerce, marketplace and other services — recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/">closed</a> $140 million in funding.</p>
<p>But Commercetools and Rally are not alone. Others include Spryker, Swell, Fabric, Chord and Shogun.</p>

<p>Amazon and Verizon later hope to offer unified internet access for industries worldwide, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-mineral-223517153.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">smart farms</a> and transportation. For now, they&#8217;re establishing technical requirements for rural broadband using Project Kuiper antenna tech already in development.</p>
<p>The two didn&#8217;t provide a timeline for this satellite-augmented service. Amazon recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-atlas-v-173405832.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">lined up rocket launches</a> for Project Kuiper, but it doesn&#8217;t expect to have half its satellites in low Earth orbit until 2026. The full constellation is expected no later than July 2029.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224077" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s an enemy-of-my-enemy aspect to this deal. Amazon and Verizon are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-amazon-fcc-delay-195245682.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">racing to compete</a> with SpaceX&#8217;s rapidly developing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-beta-end-date-181729796.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Starlink service</a> — they both risk losing customers if Starlink claims too strong a foothold, including corporate clients <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-cloud-spacex-starlink-deal-114507294.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">like Google</a>. All the same, Americans might not mind if this brings fast internet access to more parts of the country. Rural internet coverage is still far from complete, even with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/5g-fund-rural-america-fcc-181512779.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">FCC investing billions in 5G</a> — this could fill in the gaps without having to wire as much of the countryside as before.</p>
