										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MrBeast&#8217;s management company is getting into the venture business.</p>
<p><a href="https://nightmedia.co/">Night Media</a>, the six-year-old, Dallas-based multimedia talent management company, is closing a debut fund with $20 million in capital commitments from the same, powerful, family-friendly online influencers who it manages, along with other social media stars.</p>
<p>The idea, says Night Media CEO Reed Duchscher, is to write initial checks of up to $300,000 into three categories: consumer-facing startups; gaming startups, especially those centered around user-generated content; and the creator economy, including startups supporting the creator economy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The last is a world that Duchscher knows particularly well.</p>
<p>A native South Dakotan who was a wide receiver for North Dakota State University, Duchscher was working for a sports agency after graduating when he stumbled across a comedy group online called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/DudePerfect">Dude Perfect</a>. He so loved their work that he reached out to better understand who its members are and how they made money; within months, Duchscher struck on his own to work full-time with the group and seize on what appeared to be a big opportunity.</p>
<p>It was a savvy move. While Night Media no longer works with Dude Perfect, it now manages 16 other top influencer groups, with YouTube stars that include ZHC (19.7 million subscribers), Preston (15.6 million), Matt Stonie (13.7 million), Unspeakable (10.8 million), Azzyland (13.3 million), Typical Gamer (11.4 million) and Carter Sharer (7.6 million). Duchscher also notably represents MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, and who has amassed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBeast6000">55 million</a> subscribers on YouTube and whose videos routinely rack up at least 30 million views. (He posts two to three each month.)</p>
<p>In a Bloomberg piece in December about Donaldson, who now oversees a team of 50, famed filmmaker Casey Neistat said of him: &#8220;He<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/who-is-mrbeast-meet-youtube-s-top-creator-of-2020"> lives on a different planet</a> than the rest of the YouTube world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some might settle for that level of success. But Duchscher &#8212; who met Donaldson after sending him a direct message on Twitter &#8212;  has instead been helping Donaldson and his other clients think about next steps and where to invest the money they make from their social media endeavors.</p>
<p>Last year, toward that end, Night Media created a venture studio to incubate companies that its stars can help shape and grow. As part of one of those efforts, Donaldson has partnered with 300 ghost kitchens around the country to make and sell so-called Beast Burgers, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken tenders, and chocolate chip cookies &#8212; all of which can be order through a <a href="https://mrbeastburger.com/">dedicated app</a>. He has also put his stamp on the second iteration of a game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312701/mrbeast-finger-app-competition-stream-winner-final-four-prize-youtube-mschf">Finger on the App</a>.</p>
<p>Asked if MrBeastBurger or the app might be open to follow-on funding, Dunchscher suggests that&#8217;s not necessarily the plan for the startups in the venture studio, though they are open to outside funding &#8220;depending on what we&#8217;d do with all that capital.&#8221; Venture-type investment, he adds, could create unnecessary &#8220;complexity&#8221; in some cases.</p>
<p>Still, Night Media&#8217;s talent is interested in learning, shaping and capitalizing off the trends impacting their industry. Enter the new venture fund, which seems very much like a proof-of-concept vehicle.</p>
<p>Indeed, though Dunchscher says someone from the investing world is joining the outfit to spearhead the fund this spring, he has himself been running the show and spending time with &#8220;people in the Valley and L.A. who have been in industry for 20 years and been through multiple funds and financial crises&#8221; in order to learn more about institutional investing. He cites Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, for example.</p>
<p>Asked if he&#8217;s also talking with the growing number of celebrity investors on the startup scene, Dunchscher says there&#8217;s much less of that, though he says he has talked quite a bit with Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s Sound Ventures and even pulled them into a few deals, including <a href="https://playbackbone.com/">Backbone</a>, a company that makes a sleek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/">game controller for iPhones</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, Night Media Ventures has already invested in a dozen companies. Among these is a rewards app that pays users in bitcoin called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/lolli-launches-to-give-you-free-bitcoin-while-you-shop/">Lolli</a> and which is also backed by Craft Ventures and famed talent agent Guy Oseary. Another investment is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/">Pearpop</a>, an startup that invites fans to bid for shared screen time with their favorite TikTok. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/italic-launches-its-marketplace-where-you-can-buy-affordable-luxury-goods-from-top-manufacturers/">Italic</a>, a marketplace that invites shoppers to buy luxury products directly from the manufacturers behind top brands, is yet another portfolio company.</p>
<p>All have agreed to work with Night Media in exchange for access to its creators and their know-how &#8212; assets that Dunchscher believes gives the outfit an edge that most VCs can&#8217;t offer.</p>
<p>Whether it all leads to a bigger fund down the road is a question, not that Dunchscher is spending much energy on it right now. &#8220;It would depend on fund one and how quickly it gets deployed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to raise because we can. That&#8217;s never been the way we think or operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has more pressing concerns, in any case. A big part of his job is figuring out what to do with inbound interest in his clients, and there&#8217;s far more demand right now than there is inventory. &#8220;Usually, people want to work with a specific creator&#8221; and there are only so many hours in the day, for them, and for Dunchscher, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.substack.com">Substack</a> has attracted a number of high-profile writers to its newsletter platform — and it&#8217;s not a secret that the venture-backed startup has lured some of them with sizable payments.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/is-substack-the-media-future-we-want">a New Yorker article</a> late last year identified several writers (Anne Helen Petersen, Matthew Yglesias) who’d accepted “substantial” advances, and others (Robert Christgau, Alison Roman) who’d started Substack newsletters without striking deals with the company.</p>
<p>However, a number of writers publishing via Substack have begun arguing that this strategy makes the company seem less like a technology platform and more like a media company (a familiar debate around Facebook and other online giants) — or at the very least, like a technology platform that also makes editorial decisions subject to scrutiny and criticism.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, the writer Jude Ellison Sady Doyle <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">pointed to writers</a> like Yglesias, Glenn Greenwald and Freddie deBoer (several of whom departed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/substack-and-medias-groupthink-problem/617102/">larger</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/business/media/glenn-greenwald-leaving-intercept.html">publications</a>, supposedly turning to Substack for greater editorial independence) and suggested that the platform has become “famous for giving massive advances [ … ] to people who actively hate trans people and women, argue ceaselessly against our civil rights, and in many cases, have a public history of directly, viciously abusing trans people and/or cis women in their industry.”</p>
<p>Doyle initially said that they would continue publishing via Substack but would not charge a subscription fee to any readers who (like Doyle) identify as trans. Later, they added an update saying they&#8217;d be moving to a different platform called <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup cynicism and Substack, or Clubhouse, or Miami or …&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/startup-cynicism/embed/#?secret=nlv2Lu3lEa" data-secret="nlv2Lu3lEa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Science journalist and science fiction writer <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">Annalee Newitz wrote yesterday</a> that they would be leaving the platform as well. As part of their farewell, they described Substack as a “scam”: “For all we know, every single one of Substack’s top newsletters is supported by money from Substack. Until Substack reveals who exactly is on its payroll, its promises that anyone can make money on a newsletter are tainted.”</p>
<p>Substack has responded with two posts of its own. In the first,<a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"> published last week</a>, co-founder Hamish McKenzie outlined the details of what the company calls its Substack Pro program — it offers select writers an advance payment for their first year on the platform, then keeps 85% of the writers&#8217; subscription revenue. After that year, there’s no guaranteed payment, but writers get to keep 90% of their revenue. (The company also offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/substack-launches-defender-a-program-offering-legal-support-to-independent-writers/">legal support</a> and healthcare stipends.)</p>
<p>“We see these deals as business decisions, not editorial ones,” McKenzie wrote. &#8220;We don’t commission or edit stories. We don’t hire writers, or manage them. The writers, not Substack, are the owners. No one writes <em>for</em> Substack — they write for their own publications.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substack-is-for-independent-writers">The second post</a> (bylined by McKenzie and his co-founders Chris Best and Jairaj Sethi) provides additional details about who’s in the program — more than half women, more than one-third people of color, diverse viewpoints but “none that can be reasonably construed as anti-trans” — without actually naming names.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FX0vbs8IPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/">The Dispatch, a news organization built on Substack, passes $1M in annual revenue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Dispatch, a news organization built on Substack, passes $1M in annual revenue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/embed/#?secret=FX0vbs8IPb" data-secret="FX0vbs8IPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“So far, the small number of writers who have chosen to share their deals — coupled with some wrong assumptions about who might be part of the program — has created a distorted perception of the overall makeup of the group, leading to incorrect inferences about Substack’s business strategy,” the Substack founders wrote.</p>
<p>As for whether those writers are being held to any standards, the founders said, “We will continue to require all writers to abide by <a href="https://substack.com/content">Substack&#8217;s content guidelines</a>, which guard against harassment and threats. But we will also stick to a hands-off approach to censorship, as laid out in <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">our statement about our content moderation philosophy</a>.”</p>
<p>Greenwald, for his part, <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1372577432310583299">dismissed</a> the criticism as &#8220;petty Substack censors&#8221; whose position boils down to, &#8220;because you refuse to remove from your platform the writers I hate who have built a very large readership of their own, I&#8217;m taking myself and my couple of dozen readers elsewhere in protest.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when I reached out to Newitz (a friend of mine) via email, they told me that the key issue is transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Substack won&#8217;t tell us who they are paying, we can&#8217;t figure out who on the site has grown their audience organically, and who is getting juiced,&#8221; Newitz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s blatantly misleading for people who are trying to figure out whether they can make money on the platform. Plus, keeping their Pro list secret means we can&#8217;t verify Substack&#8217;s claims about how its staff writers are on ‘all sides’ of the political spectrum.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why would Snowflake give up such a powerful tool a mere six months after it went public? We decided to look at the notion of dual-class shares and why Snowflake may have been willing to let them go.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snowflake <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014721000021/snow-20210301.htm">announced</a> earlier this month that it would give up its dual-class shareholder structure, a corporate governance setup that often gives founders and executives superior voting rights, typically involving 10 times as many votes for their own shares as others receive. The mechanism can enable founders to maintain control despite later dilution and may sometimes even grant ironclad control to an individual in perpetuity.</p>
<p>For many companies, these supervoting shares represent a highly powerful tool, allowing founders to have their <a href="https://chairmanofboard.com/dual-class-shares/">cake and eat it, too</a> — to go public and receive the advantages of being a public company while limiting the power of external shareholders to influence how they run the company once it floats.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Some founders and their investors argue that these preferred shares protect them from the short-term whims of the market, but the perspective isn&#8217;t universally accepted.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Some founders and their investors argue that <a href="https://foundercentric.org/research/2019/4/28/andreessen-horowitz-limit-dont-ban-dual-class-share-structures">these preferred shares protect them</a> from the short-term whims of the market, but the perspective isn&#8217;t universally accepted. Dual-class shares <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/06/28/dual-class-shares-governance-risks-and-company-performance/">are a controversial governance structure</a>, and some wonder if they are setting up an unfair playing field by allowing a cabal to wield outsized power.</p>
<p>Why would Snowflake give up such a powerful tool a mere six months after it went public? We decided to look at the notion of dual-class shares and why Snowflake may have been willing to let them go.</p>
<h2>Snowflake&#8217;s decision</h2>
<p>If one of the primary purposes of dual-class shares is to consolidate CEO power, then perhaps Snowflake felt they weren&#8217;t necessary, given the history of CEO-shuffling at the company. While Snowflake&#8217;s founders are still part of the organization, they hired Sutter Hill investor Mike Speiser to be their first CEO, followed by former Microsoft exec Bob Muglia before finally bringing in veteran CEO Frank Slootman to take their company public.</p>
<p>Without an all-powerful CEO founder in place, perhaps the company felt that supervoting shares weren&#8217;t necessary. Regardless, Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli framed the move as a decision that works for all parties when he announced that his company would abandon the special shares during its earnings call earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we announced that on March 1st, 2021, our Class B shareholders in accordance with our governing documents converted all of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, eliminating the dual-class structure of our common stock and ensuring that each share has an equal vote. We view this as operationally beneficial to the company and our shareholders,&#8221; Scarpelli said <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/04/snowflake-inc-snow-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcrip/">during the call</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA doesn&#8217;t just let anyone launch whatever they want to space without checking in with the agency about potential impacts to its own assets on orbit, including the International Space Station (ISS). The agency has a standard set of guidelines around so-called &#8220;Conjunction Assessment,&#8221; which is basically determine the risk that a close approach between in-space objects might occur, which in turn could potentially result in a collision. This assessment determines when and where something flies, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Today, NASA published a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa-spacex_starlink_agreement_final.pdf">new agreement</a> between itself and SpaceX that goes above and beyond its standard Conjunction Assessment practices. The special agreement, which exists under the mandate of the Space Act that allows NASA to work with any company in order to fulfill its mandate, is defined as a &#8216;nonreimbursable&#8217; one, or just one in which no money changes hands, which is designed to benefit both parties involved.</p>
<p>It effectively lays out that because SpaceX operates Starlink, which is the largest existing on-orbit constellation of spacecraft, and which is growing at a rapid pace, and because each of these is equipped with the ability to maneuver itself autonomously in response to mission parameters, there needs to exist a deeper ongoing partnership between NASA and SpaceX for conjunction avoidance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Accordingly, the agreement outlines the ways in which communication and information sharing between NASA and SpaceX will exceed what has been typically been expected. For NASA&#8217;s part, it&#8217;ll be providing detailed and accurate info about its planned missions in advance to SpaceX so that they can use that to properly program Starlink&#8217;s automated avoidance measures whenever a mission is happening where NASA assets might cross paths with the constellation. It&#8217;ll also be working directly with SpaceX on improving its its ability to assess and avoid any incidents, and will be providing technical support on how SpaceX might better mitigate &#8220;photometric brightness,&#8221; or the reflectivity of its Starlink spacecraft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B5lmh7m7Tz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/in-space-manufacturing-could-prompt-more-startups-to-reach-for-the-stars/">In-space manufacturing could prompt more startups to reach for the stars</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In-space manufacturing could prompt more startups to reach for the stars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/in-space-manufacturing-could-prompt-more-startups-to-reach-for-the-stars/embed/#?secret=B5lmh7m7Tz" data-secret="B5lmh7m7Tz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, SpaceX will be responsible for ensuring its Starlink satellites take &#8216;evasive action&#8217; to &#8216;mitigate close approaches and avoid collisions with all NASA assets.&#8221; It&#8217;ll also be required to provide time frame &#8216;cut-outs&#8217; for periods when Starlink satellites aren&#8217;t able to employ their collision avoidance, which mostly occurs during the phase right after they&#8217;re launch when they&#8217;re still being activated and put into their target orbits.</p>
<p>Another key point in the agreement is that SpaceX plan Starlink launches so the they&#8217;re at minimum either 5km above or below the highest and lowest points of the International Space Station&#8217;s orbit as it makes its way around the Earth. Finally, SpaceX is also expected to share its own analysis of the effectiveness of its satellite dimming techniques, so the agency can adjust its own guidance on the subject accordingly.</p>
<p>The full agreement is embedded below, but the main takeaway is that NASA clearly wants SpaceX to be a better low-Earth partner and citizen as the size of its constellation pushes past the 1,200 mark, on track to grow to around 1,500 or more by year&#8217;s end. Also, NASA&#8217;s putting a lot of trust and responsibility in SpaceX&#8217;s hands – basically it&#8217;s laying out that Starlink&#8217;s built-in autonomous capabilities can avoid any really danger that might arise. The way NASA has structured this document also leaves open the possibility that it could repurpose it for other constellation operators – a growing need given the number of companies working on networks of low-Earth orbit spacecraft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a> has been one of a handful of NFT marketplaces to explode in popularity in recent weeks as collectors wade into the trading of nonfungible tokens on the blockchain. While new startups have been popping up everyday, platforms that launched in crypto&#8217;s earlier times are receiving rampant attention from investors who see this wave of excitement for cryptocurrencies and tokens as much different than the ones that preceded it.</p>
<p>Today, the startup announced that it&#8217;s closed a $23 million round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from a laundry list of angels and firms including Naval Ravikant, Mark Cuban, Alexis Ohanian, Dylan Field and Linda Xie.</p>
<p>OpenSea launched back in 2017, announcing a $2 million round a few months later from Founders Fund and a few crypto centric firms. At the time CryptoKitties mania was most of what Ethereum had to offer and early NFT projects were being slowly embraced by a community that was enthusiastic but more curious than anything.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast forward to 2021 and NFTs are certainly having a moment, and while the specific shades of that moment may be heavily focused on high-dollar artwork sales from traditional auction houses or NFT memes being tweeted out by Elon Musk, proponents see a future for the tokens that upends the economics of content creation and influence on the internet. The enthusiasm accompanies a months-long rally in the value of cryptocurrencies themselves that have taken Ethereum and Bitcoin to multiples of previous all-time highs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k1oQDGJLp3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=k1oQDGJLp3" data-secret="k1oQDGJLp3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The market for digital goods expanding widely may depend heavily on further adoption among gaming giants and larger media organizations, but early on there&#8217;s hope that digital-first creators can use these marketplaces to connect more directly with fans and begin to bypass the massive platforms they depend on now.</p>
<p>There are still some early hiccups as the tech develops. While Ethereum has committed to moving from its energy-intensive proof-of-work standard to a more efficient proof-of-stake one eventually, the existing structure has been far from efficient, which has opened many of the early NFT artists to criticism surrounding climate change concerns and whether the stakeholders in crypto tokens should be prioritizing environmental worries over the specific challenges of certain proofs. In February, OpenSea <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/tezos-nfts-are-coming-to-opensea/">announced</a> support for more efficient Tezos-based NFTs.</p>
<p>A more nebulous challenge for marketplaces like OpenSea may be cutting through the noise of speculation and providing a marketplace for more users that are actually buying to own, an especially difficult proposition given the breakneck pace of growth for the digital currencies being used to purchase the digital goods themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the EV startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">backed by Amazon</a>, Cox Automotive and T. Rowe Price, plans to install more than 10,000 chargers by the end of 2023. The network will have a dual purpose: quickly power its electric vehicle models with fast chargers installed along highways and provide Level 2 chargers at further afield locations next to parks, trailheads and other adventurous destinations.</p>
<p>The company said Thursday that its so-called Rivian Adventure Network will include more than 3,500 DC fast chargers at over 600 sites, which will only be accessible to owners of its electric vehicles. Each site will have multiple chargers and located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops, the company said in a blog post Thursday.</p>
<p>Rivian is also installing thousands of &#8220;waypoint&#8221; Level 2 AC chargers throughout the United States and Canada. These waypoint chargers will have a 11.5 kW charging speed, which should be able add up to 25 miles of range every hour for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The waypoint chargers will be strategically located along and near routes that Rivian customers are likely to take. They will be found at shopping centers restaurants, hotels, campsites and parks. The first of these waypoints, which will be open to the public and accessible to all electric vehicle brands with a J1772 plug, are being installed at all 42 Colorado State Parks. Each park will have two Rivian Waypoints each, with installation starting in July, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decision to add this second layer of electric vehicle chargers is a direct appeal to Rivian’s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">told TechCrunch</a> late last year during a wide-ranging interview about charging, batteries and automated driving.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s approach is similar to Tesla with a few distinct differences. Tesla has built a proprietary network of more than 20,000 Superchargers, which are typically located next to highways and busy commuter corridors, and destination chargers installed at high-end hotels, restaurants and other spots an owner of a Model 3, Model S, Model Y or Model X might visit.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s waypoint chargers serve the same purpose — albeit different kinds of locations — to the Tesla destination chargers. However, unlike Tesla&#8217;s chargers, Rivian&#8217;s waypoint site are open to the public and use the J1772 plug, a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>As part of its announcement, Rivian shared an image of a map of its fast chargers, indicating where they will be located. The map is not yet interactive, making it difficult to provide exact locations, but it appears that there are fast chargers located near Grand Canyon National Park as well as Zion National Park in Utah.</p>

<p>Rivian owners will be able to locate the waypoints as well as its branded fast chargers through the vehicle&#8217;s navigation and the accompanying app. Drivers will also be able to use the app or in-car system to and monitor charge status.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s vehicles are equipped with a direct current connector used for rapid charging called Combined Charging System (CCS). CCS is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America. This means that Rivian trucks and SUVs can also use any third-party CCS charging station without having to use an adapter.</p>
<p>The company indicated that the entire charging network will be powered by 100% renewable energy. That doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a solar panel and energy storage system. Rivian clarified to TechCrunch at there will not be solar or wind on site. Instead, the 100% renewable energy goal will be achieved through partnerships with electricity providers. Rivian said it will use wind and solar wherever possible along with Renewable Energy Certificates to offset other power sources.</p>
<p>Building out such a large network will require capital, which Rivian hasn&#8217;t had trouble accessing. Rivian announced in January that it had raised $2.65 billion in a round led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners as well as several other existing and new investors also participated, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, according to a person familiar with the investment round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An artificial retina would be an enormous boon to the many people with visual impairments, and the possibility is creeping closer to reality year by year. One of the latest advancements takes a different and very promising approach, using tiny dots that convert light to electricity, and virtual reality has helped show that it could be a viable path forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/retinal-implants-can-give-artificial-vision-to-the/">These photovoltaic retinal prostheses</a> come from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, where Diego Ghezzi has been working on the idea for several years now.</p>
<p>Early retinal prosthetics were created decades ago, and the basic idea is as follows: A camera outside the body (on a pair of glasses, for instance) sends a signal over a wire to a tiny microelectrode array, which consists of many tiny electrodes that pierce the nonfunctioning retinal surface and stimulate the working cells directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problems with this are mainly that powering and sending data to the array requires a wire running from outside the eye in — generally speaking a &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221; when it comes to prosthetics and the body in general. The array itself is also limited in the number of electrodes it can have by the size of each, meaning for many years the effective resolution in the best case scenario was on the order of a few dozen or hundred &#8220;pixels.&#8221; (The concept doesn&#8217;t translate directly because of the way the visual system works.)</p>
<p>Ghezzi&#8217;s approach obviates both these problems with the use of photovoltaic materials, which turn light into an electric current. It&#8217;s not so different from what happens in a digital camera, except instead of recording the charge as in image, it sends the current into the retina like the powered electrodes did. There&#8217;s no need for a wire to relay power or data to the implant, because both are provided by the light shining on it.</p>

<p>In the case of the EPFL prosthesis, there are thousands of tiny photovoltaic dots, which would in theory be illuminated by a device outside the eye sending light in according to what it detects from a camera. Of course, it&#8217;s still an incredibly difficult thing to engineer. The other part of the setup would be a pair of glasses or goggles that both capture an image and project it through the eye onto the implant.</p>
<p>We first heard of this approach back in 2018, and things have changed somewhat since then, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-021-00133-2">as a new paper documents</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We increased the number of pixels from about 2,300 to 10,500,&#8221; explained Ghezzi in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;So now it is difficult to see them individually and they look like a continuous film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course when those dots are pressed right up against the retina it&#8217;s a different story. After all, that&#8217;s only 100&#215;100 pixels or so if it were a square — not exactly high definition. But the idea isn&#8217;t to replicate human vision, which may be an impossible task to begin with, let alone realistic for anyone&#8217;s first shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically it is possible to make pixel smaller and denser,&#8221; Ghezzi explained. &#8220;The problem is that the current generated decreases with the pixel area.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127161" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127161" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127161 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg" alt="Image showing a close-up of the photovoltaic dots on the retinal implant, labeled as being about 80 microns across each." width="1024" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg 1404w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=300,96 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=768,246 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=680,217 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127161" class="wp-caption-text">Current decreases with pixel size, and pixel size isn&#8217;t exactly large to begin with. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ghezzi et al</p></div></p>
<p>So the more you add, the tougher it is to make it work, and there&#8217;s also the risk (which they tested) that two adjacent dots will stimulate the same network in the retina. But too few and the image created may not be intelligible to the user. 10,500 <em>sounds</em> like a lot, and it <em>may</em> be enough — but the simple fact is that there&#8217;s no data to support that. To start on that the team turned to what may seem like an unlikely medium: VR.</p>
<p>Because the team can&#8217;t exactly do a &#8220;test&#8221; installation of an experimental retinal implant on people to see if it works, they needed another way to tell whether the dimensions and resolution of the device would be sufficient for certain everyday tasks like recognizing objects and letters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg" alt="A digitally rendered street scene and distorted monochrome versions below showing various ways of representing it via virtual phosphors." width="1024" height="747" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg 1725w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jacob Thomas Thorn et al</p></div></p>
<p>To do this, they put people in VR environments that were dark except for little simulated &#8220;phosphors,&#8221; the pinpricks of light they expect to create by stimulating the retina via the implant; Ghezzi likened what people would see to a constellation of bright, shifting stars. They varied the number of phosphors, the area they appear over, and the length of their illumination or &#8220;tail&#8221; when the image shifted, asking participants how well they could perceive things like a word or scene.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127142" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg" alt="The word &quot;AGREE&quot; rendered in various ways with virtual phosphors." width="1024" height="730" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg 1725w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=1536,1095 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jacob Thomas Thorn et al</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abb5bc">Their primary finding</a> was that the most important factor was visual angle — the overall size of the area where the image appears. Even a clear image is difficult to understand if it only takes up the very center of your vision, so even if overall clarity suffers it&#8217;s better to have a wide field of vision. The robust analysis of the visual system in the brain intuits things like edges and motion even from sparse inputs.</p>
<p>This demonstration showed that the implant&#8217;s parameters are theoretically sound and the team can start working toward human trials. That&#8217;s not something that can happen in a hurry, and while this approach is very promising compared with earlier, wired ones, it will still be several years even in the best case scenario before it&#8217;s possible it could be made widely available. Still, the very prospect of a working retinal implant of this type is an exciting one and we&#8217;ll be following it closely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this week announced its was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">cutting the commissions</a> it charges Android app developers who publish on its Google Play marketplace, following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/developers-can-now-enroll-in-apples-small-business-program-for-reduced-app-store-fees/">similar move by Apple last year</a> aimed at fending off antitrust claims. According to Google&#8217;s own estimates, 99% of its developers who sell goods and services would see their fees cut in half, as a result of the move that reduces the 30% commission to 15% on the first million dollars a developer earns. Now, data shared by App Annie helps to further illustrate the distribution of earnings on the Google Play Store, as well as how that compares with Apple&#8217;s counterpart.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to App Annie, the vast majority (97.9%) of Google Play publishers made less than $1 million in annual consumer spend in 2020, which allows them to qualify for this reduced commission. But it&#8217;s worth noting that</span> the way Google has implemented its new policy is different from Apple, as it will reduce the commission on the &#8220;first&#8221; $1 million in revenue made during the year &#8212; not make $1 million the threshold that triggers a commission increase, like Apple is doing. That means more developers could benefit from Google&#8217;s policy change.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how few developers across Google Play will ever have to worry about the higher commission bracket. The majority are seeing very small returns from their paid downloads, in-app purchases or subscription offering, the data indicates. This has been an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">ongoing trend for Android apps</a>, in fact, reflecting Android&#8217;s traction in emerging markets where consumers don&#8217;t often spend on apps, which has forced many developers to lean on ads in addition to in-app purchases to generate revenues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>According to App Annie, 85,381 Google Play developers in 2020 generated less than $100,000 in consumer spend. 3,404 generated $100,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>Only 568 developers began to even near the $1 million figure, with consumer spend of $500,000 to $750,000 in 2020. Then there were just 359 developers making $750,000 up to that first million.</p>
<p>The groups that would actually see the 30% commission apply to some of their sales were very small.</p>
<p>Just 215 developers saw consumer spend of $1 million to $1.25 million. Only 512 developers made between $1.25 million and $2 million. And then there&#8217;s the most profitable group, where 1,308 developers made over $2 million in revenue in 2020.</p>
<p>This distribution pattern where the largest group of developers is making under $100,000 and a sliver of the market was pulling in larger figures, including the over $2 million bracket, was similar to Apple&#8217;s App Store in 2020. But in Apple&#8217;s case, it sees more developers earning a decent income in the other sub-$1-million brackets than Google Play does.</p>
<p>The reason why Apple may have decided to charge a higher commission for developers making over $1 million is also reflected in these charts. Apple simply has more developers who qualify by making over $1 million per year. (On iOS, 3,611 developers make $1 million or more on the App Store versus 2,035 developers on Google Play).</p>

<p>In other words, these policy changes help a large majority of mobile app developers by allowing them to take home more money, and they give Apple and Google a good way to demonstrate to regulators that they&#8217;re not wielding their market power against the &#8220;little guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, App Annie says that publishers making up to $1 million in consumer spend only comprised 5% of total Google Play consumer spend in 2020, even though 94% of Google Play apps offer some sort of in-app purchase mechanism.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the new policies have far less impact on the revenue the platforms themselves are pulling in via commissions. However, Google&#8217;s rule makes it simpler and more fair for developers who are still trying to grow their businesses despite crossing the $1 million threshold.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether it's bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are offering new mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) products intended to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, St. Louis Metro Transit was struggling to keep customers. Uber and Lyft, along with dockless shared bikes and scooters, had flooded streets, causing ridership to fall more than 7% in a single year.</p>
<p>The agency didn&#8217;t try to fight for attention. Instead, it embraced its competitors.</p>
<p>Metro Transit dropped its internal trip-planning app, which had been developed with the Trapeze Group and directed riders to Transit, a private third-party app that offers mapping and real-time transit data in more than 200 cities. That app also included micromobility and ride-hailing information, allowing customers to not just look up bus schedules, but see how they might get to and from stops &#8212; or ignore the bus altogether.</p>
<p>The following year, Metro Transit partnered with mobile ticketing company Masabi and added a payment option on some bus routes. Now, the agency is planning an all-in-one app — via third-party providers Transit and Masabi — where customers could plan and book end-to-end trips across trains, buses, bikes, scooters and taxis.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do best is transporting large volumes of people on vehicles and managing mass transit,&#8221; said Metro Transit executive director Jessica Mefford-Miller. &#8220;On the software side, there are a lot of players out there doing great stuff that can help us meet our customers where they are and make trip planning as easy as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Louis Metro Transit isn&#8217;t an outlier. As transit agencies seek to win back riders, a flurry of platforms &#8212; some backed by giants like Uber, Intel and BMW &#8212; are offering new technology partnerships. Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling these mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.</p>

			Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Third-party platforms have become more appealing to transit agencies as they scramble to keep buses, trains and rail full of customers. According to the <a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/APTA-2020-Fact-Book.pdf">American Public Transportation Association</a> (APTA), ridership and total miles traveled has declined since 2014, including a 2.5% drop from 2017 to 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic could accelerate this trend as more people continue working from home or shy away from crowding into buses and trains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like Expedia, the idea of seeing multiple airlines in one place to comparison shop,&#8221; said Regina Clewlow, CEO of transportation management firm Populus. &#8220;A lot of operators are looking at the question of whether that would give them more rides.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that the private growth could come at a cost, potentially injecting private concerns into what should be a public good, Metro Transit&#8217;s Mefford-Miller cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we let the market handle this planning on its own, a company might only do it for someone with a digital device or a bank account or only help people who don&#8217;t need special accommodation,&#8221; Mefford-Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we have as an underpinning an equitable and accessible system. It&#8217;s the underpinning before we choose any tools we use.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>Amid the swarm of new startups there are a few giants. One of the biggest established players is <a href="https://www.cubic.com/">Cubic Corp.</a>, a San Diego-based defense and public transportation company. The firm already controls payments and back-end software for hundreds of transit agencies, including in Chicago, New York and San Francisco, and in January launched a <a href="https://www.cubic.com/news-events/news/cubic-announces-global-launch-umo-platforms-enhance-urban-mobility">suite of new products</a> under the brand name Umo to expand their offerings.</p>
<p>The package includes a customer-facing multimodal app, a fare collection platform, a contactless payment system, a rewards program, a behind-the-scenes management platform and a MaaS marketplace for public and private offerings. Mick Spiers, general manager of Umo, said the goal is to offer a &#8220;connected, integrated journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re uniquely placed as an independent, trusted third party that can be the data broker for a journey focused around the needs of the user,&#8221; Spiers added. &#8220;The journey we create has no commercial interest for us.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The explosion in productivity software amid a broader remote work boom has been one of the pandemic&#8217;s clearest tech impacts. But learning to use a dozen new programs while having to decipher which data is hosted where can sometimes seem to have an adverse effect on worker productivity. It&#8217;s all time that users can take for granted, even when carrying out common tasks like navigating to the calendar to view more info to click a link to open the browser to redirect to the native app to open a Zoom call.</p>
<p><a href="https://slapdash.com/">Slapdash</a> is aiming to carve a new niche out for itself among workplace software tools, pushing a desire for peak performance to the forefront with a product that shaves seconds off each instance where a user needs to find data hosted in a cloud app or carry out an action. While most of the integration-heavy software suites to emerge during the remote work boom have focused on promoting visibility or re-skinning workflows across the tangled weave of SaaS apps, Slapdash founder Ivan Kanevski hopes that the company&#8217;s efforts to engineer a quicker path to information will push tech workers to integrate another tool into their workflow.</p>

<p>The team tells TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve raised $3.7 million in seed funding from investors that include <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">S28 Capital, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Quiet Capital, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Quarry Ventures, UP2398 and </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twenty Two Ventures. Angels participating in the round include co-founders at companies like Patreon, Docker and Zynga.</span></p>

<p>Kanevski says the team sought to emulate the success of popular apps like Superhuman, which have pushed low-latency command line interface navigation while emulating some of the sleek internal tools used at companies like Facebook, where he spent nearly six years as a software engineer.</p>
<p>Slapdash&#8217;s command line widget can be pulled up anywhere, once installed, with a quick keyboard shortcut. From there, users can search through a laundry list of indexable apps including Slack, Zoom, Jira and about 20 others. Beyond command line access, users can create folders of files and actions inside the full desktop app or create their own keyboard shortcuts to quickly hammer out a task. The app is available on Mac, Windows, Linux and the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to displace the applications that you connect to Slapdash,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You won&#8217;t see us, for example, building document editing, you won&#8217;t see us building project management, just because our sort of philosophy is that we&#8217;re a neutral platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company offers a free tier for users indexing up to five apps and creating 10 commands and spaces; any more than that and you level up into a $12 per month paid plan. Things look more customized for enterprise-wide pricing. As the team hopes to make the tool essential to startups, Kanevski sees the app&#8217;s hefty utility for individual users as a clear asset in scaling up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you anticipate rolling this out to larger organizations, you would want the people that are using the software to have a blast with it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We have quite a lot of confidence that even at this sort of individual atomic level, we built something pretty joyful and helpful.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">announced</a> it would begin testing a better way to display images on its app, it&#8217;s now doing the same for YouTube videos. According to a new <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?s=20">post</a> on Twitter&#8217;s Support account, the company will today start testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly from your home timeline within the Twitter iOS app. That means you&#8217;ll be able to click and play a video without having to leave the conversation you&#8217;re currently viewing.</p>
<p>Before this change, YouTube videos wouldn&#8217;t show a preview on iOS, so you&#8217;d have to click the link to start watching. This would take you out of the conversation to another screen where you could play the video or tap again to open the YouTube iOS app, if you preferred.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ll be able to scroll and watch videos without losing your place on the Twitter timeline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s using the YouTube iFrame Player API for this test, which will initially be live on iOS in the U.S., Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia before rolling it out globally. It didn&#8217;t offer a time frame for when this would be available to all Twitter users.</p>
<p>The company had announced earlier this month it would be working toward a better media-viewing experience on its app, including for both sharing and viewing media, like photos and videos. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">the photo preview test</a> launched to iOS and Android last week, Twitter is now giving users a more accurate preview of what images look like, for example. Before, it would crop images automatically &#8212; often hiding key portions of a photo.</p>

<p>Twitter also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940">announced</a> the ability for users to upload 4K images on both Android and iOS, accessible through a new feature in your &#8220;Data Usage&#8221; settings in the Twitter app.</p>
<p>These changes are not only welcome from a user annoyance perspective, they&#8217;re also tied into Twitter&#8217;s newly announced ambitions to become a platform that serves creators. The company said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new subscription-based service<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/"> called &#8220;Super Follow&#8221;</a> that will allow creators to publish subscriber-only content on Twitter, like newsletters, deals and other exclusive content, which likely includes exclusive media. But in order to support creators, who often have their content spread across social platforms around the web, Twitter has to make the process of sharing that content &#8212; whether photos, videos or anything else &#8212; feel seamless and native to the app.</p>
<p>Twitter will likely have a few more updates on this front in the days and weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to make significant advances in attracting customers away from the big incumbents by providing more modern, user-friendly tools to manage their money. Today, one of the trailblazers in this area, <a href="http://kuda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda Technologies</a>, is announcing funding to continue building out its specific ambition: to provide a modern banking service for Africans and the African diaspora, or as co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi describes them, &#8220;every African on the planet, wherever you are in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which currently offers mobile-first banking services in Nigeria, has picked up $25 million in a Series A being led by Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by Peter Thiel, with Target Global and other unnamed investors participating. This is the first time that Valar &#8212; which has <a href="https://valar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> in a number of fintech startups, including N26, TransferWise, Stash and, just in the last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-closes-52m-series-a-from-valar-ventures-backed-by-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitPanda</a> &#8212; has backed an African startup.</p>
<p>Kuda currently provides services for consumers to save and spend money, and it has recently introduced overdrafts (essentially revolving credit for individuals). Ogundeyi said in an interview that the plan is to use these new funds to continue expanding its credit offerings, to build out services for businesses, to add in more integrations and to move into more markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for Kuda, which is co-headquartered in London and Lagos.</p>
<p>When we last wrote about the startup, four months ago, it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just closed a seed round of $10 million</a> led by Target Global. That was, at the time &#8212; and I think still is &#8212; the largest-ever seed round raised by a startup out of Africa, and thus as much of a milestone for the tech industry there as it was for Kuda itself.</p>
<p>At the time of the seed round, Kuda had registered 300,000 customers: now, that figure has more than doubled to 650,000, and tellingly, that base is spending more money through the Kuda app.</p>

<p>&#8220;In November we were doing about $500 million in transactions per month,&#8221; Ogundeyi said, for services like bill payments, card transactions and phone top-ups. &#8220;We closed February at $2.2 billion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuda, as we described in our profile of the company when covering its seed round, is following in the footsteps of a number of other so-called &#8220;neobanks&#8221;, building a suite of banking services with a more accessible user interface and a more modern approach: you interact with the bank using a mobile app, and in addition to basic banking services, it provides tools to help people manage their money more intelligently.</p>
<p>But Kuda is also different from many of these, specifically because it taps into some financial practices that are unique to its market.</p>
<p>As Ogundeyi describes it, most people who are employed by companies will have &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; at banks, where companies pay in a person&#8217;s wages on a regular basis. These will typically be at incumbent banks, but they do not offer the same ranges of services to customers. No mobile apps, no facilities to buy mobile top-ups or make other kinds of bill payments, no AI-based calculators to figure out your monthly spend and provide suggestions on how to manage your budget, and so on.</p>
<p>That has opened a gap in the market for others to provide those services in their place. Kuda&#8217;s deposits, Ogundeyi said, typically start as basic transfers that people make from those &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; elsewhere. These start out small, maybe 20% of a person&#8217;s wages, but as those users find themselves using Kuda&#8217;s payment and other tools more, they are increasing how much they transfer in each payment period.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the trust increases you’re naturally more comfortable having money with Kuda,&#8221; he said. The next stage from that will be people depositing money directly with Kuda. A small minority already do this, he added, although the startup &#8220;has a bit more work to do&#8221; to get more companies integrated into its platform. (This is one of the areas that will be developed with this latest round of funding.)</p>
<p>In turn, having more money in Kuda accounts is likely to spur another wave of services being turned on at the startup, such as loans with more competitive interest rates, because they will not just be based on how much money people have but also their spending histories on the platform. &#8220;We can offer loans to salaried customers instantly as long as their salary is with Kuda,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Much of this is being enabled because of how Kuda is built. A lot of challenger banks have tapped into a world of finance and banking APIs built by another wave of fintech startups, partnering with other banks to provide backend deposit and other services: their value-add is in building efficient customer service and tools to help people manage and borrow money in smarter ways.</p>
<p>Kuda, on the other hand, has its own microfinance banking license from the central bank of Nigeria. This means that on top of building those same money management services, Kuda can also issue<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> debit cards (in partnership with Visa and Mastercard), manage </span>p<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ayments and transfers, and build all of the services in the stack itself, including those salary account services and loans. (Kuda does have partnerships with incumbent banks, specifically Zenith Bank, Guaranteed Trust and Access Bank, for people to come in for physical deposits and withdrawals when needed.)</span></p>
<p>While the service is still only live in Nigeria, the &#8220;vision is still to serve all Africans in Africa as well as outside of it,&#8221; Ogundeyi said.</p>
<p>The first step of that will likely be Nigerians outside of Nigeria &#8212; most likely in the U.K., where Kuda already has a headquarters, and where it has a ready market: London alone has been estimated to be home to upwards of 1 million Nigerian immigrants and people of Nigerian descent (the number of U.K. residents actually born in Nigeria is considerably smaller, more like <a href="https://www.worldremit.com/en/stories/story/2019/10/29/nigerians-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200,000</a>: that is the diaspora at work).</p>
<p>He added that the startup is also at work on preparing for the next countries on the continent to expand its service, another area where this funding will go: &#8220;It will let us fast-track teams, on-the-ground operational teams,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The bigger picture is that the market for financial services targeting Africans has been on a significant upswing and so we will be seeing a lot more activity coming out of the region, not just from home-grown startups, but also out of other tech companies increasingly doing more business in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Cases in point: In addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe acquiring Nigerian payments company Paystack last year</a>, just earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal announced a deal with Flutterwave</a> to bring PayPal services to more merchants in the region &#8212; specifically so that PayPal customers can pay merchants in the region using PayPal rails. Square&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/into-africa-tech-leaders-weigh-in-on-jack-dorseys-planned-move-to-the-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey, meanwhile, never did make his intended move to the continent</a> &#8212; COVID-19 has derailed many plans, as we all know &#8212; but it shows that the company is trying not to overlook opportunities there, either.</p>
<p>PayPal, to be clear, has been active in Nigeria <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/17/paypal-extends-payment-services-to-nigeria-9-other-countries/?sh=2c7a198f649b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>, but partnering with a significant player in the region represents an important step for it: Flutterwave itself earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $170 million</a> and became Africa&#8217;s latest unicorn, in what is still a pretty small list.</p>
<p>The fact that there is so much more to be done with payments and more financial services leaves the door open wide for Kuda to move in a number of different directions if it chooses. Having customers in two countries, especially with one foot in the developed market and another in an emerging market, for example, gives the company an interesting window into the world of remittances.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fzvf7uTYIK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=Fzvf7uTYIK" data-secret="Fzvf7uTYIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Money transfer has been one of the very biggest, and most important financial services for African diasporas &#8212; alongside those from many other emerging markets.</p>
<p>Even in cases where people are &#8220;unbanked&#8221; and have no other financial footprints, they have been turning to remittance services to send money home to their families from abroad. Kuda, with its integrations into people&#8217;s salaries, could easily become an efficient, one-stop-shop conduit for that activity too. (That&#8217;s one reason, likely, that remittance startup, Remitly, has also moved into starting to offer accounts to its users in originating countries.)</p>
<p>All of this to say that Valar&#8217;s making a new kind of bet here, but one laden with possibilities and a differentiated approach compared to the rest of its investment activities.</p>
<p>“Nigeria is at a tipping point in the adoption of digital banking,&#8221; noted Andrew McCormack, a general partner and co-founder at Valar, who led its investment here. &#8220;With the rapidly growing, youthful population who are open to new financial alternatives, Kuda is well-positioned to benefit and will transform the landscape of African banking. We are excited to lead their Series A and continue on the journey alongside Kuda.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Laura Crabtree spent a good chunk of her childhood watching rocket launches on television, and her entire professional career launching rockets, first at Northrup Grumman and then at SpaceX.</p>
<p>Now, the former senior missions operations engineer at SpaceX is the co-founder and chief executive of a new LA-based space startup called <a href="https://www.epsilon3.io/">Epsilon3</a>, which says it has developed the operating system for launch operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tools I had wanted did not exist,&#8221; said Crabtree. So when she left SpaceX to pursue her next opportunity, it was a no-brainer to try to develop the toolkit she never had, the first-time entrepreneur said. &#8220;I started looking at ways in which I could help the space industry become more efficient and reduce errors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining Crabtree in the new business is Max Mednik, a serial entrepreneur whose last company, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Epirus</a>, raised at least $144.7 million from investors including 8VC, Bedrock Capital and L3 Harris Technologies, and Aaron Sullivan, a former Googler who serves as the chief software engineer. Mednik worked at Google too before turning his attention to entrepreneurship. His previous businesses ranged from financial services software to legal services software, but Mednik also had an interest in aerospace. His first job offers out of school were with SpaceX, JPL and Google.</p>
<p>Part of a growing network of SpaceX alumni launching businesses, Epsilon3, like its fellow travelers First Resonance and Prewitt Ridge, is creating a product around an aspect of the design, manufacturing mission management and operations of rockets that had previously been handled manually or with bespoke tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They make mission management software for the launchers and for the satellite companies that are going to be the payload of the rocket companies,&#8221; said Alex Rubalcava, the founder and managing partner of Stage Venture Partners, an investor in the company&#8217;s recent seed round. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just the design and spec but for when they’re actually working what are they doing; when you’re uplinking and downlinking data and changing software.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As launch market matures, space opportunities on the ground take off&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/as-launch-market-matures-space-opportunities-on-the-ground-take-off/embed/#?secret=gdH8NFAckX" data-secret="gdH8NFAckX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rubalcava acknowledged that the market for Epsilon3 is entirely new, but it&#8217;s growing rapidly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was an analysis based on the fact that access to space used to be really expensive and used to be the provenance of governments and 10 or 20 commercial satellite operators in the world. And it was limited by the fact that there were only a handful of companies that could launch,&#8221; Rubalcava said. &#8220;Now all of a sudden there’s going to be 30 different space flights. Thirty different companies that have rockets… access to space used to scarce, expensive, and highly restricted and it’s no longer any of those things now.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>The demand for space services is exploding, with <a href="https://www.360researchreports.com/global-space-launch-services-market-17251139">some analysts estimating</a> that the launch services industry could reach over $18 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very similar story and we all come from different places within SpaceX,&#8221; said Crabtree. <a href="https://www.firstresonance.io/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9MuCBhBUEiwAbDZ-7qD6ykEgr1hEG3Pgt9b186qxq1NYZgKEErKtXf3Dgm0-XJKXWHhrExoC1sMQAvD_BwE">First Resonance</a> provides software that moves from prototyping to production; <a href="https://www.prewittridge.com/">Prewitt Ridge</a> provides engineering and management tools; and Epsilon3 has developed an operating system for launch operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;You’ve got design development, manufacturing, integration tests and operations. We’re trying to support that integration of tests and operations,&#8221; said Crabtree. </span></p>
<p>While First Resonance and Prewitt Ridge have applications in aerospace and manufacturing broadly, Crabtree&#8217;s eyes, and her company&#8217;s mission, remain fixed on the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re laser focused on space and proving out that the software works in the highest stakes and most complex environments,&#8221; said Mednik. There are applications in other areas that require complex workflows for industries as diverse as nuclear plant construction and operations, energy, mining and aviation broadly, but for now and the foreseeable future, it&#8217;s all about the space business.</p>
<p>Mednik described the software as an electronic toolkit for controlling and editing workflows and procedures. &#8220;You can think of it as Asana project management meets GitHub version control,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be for integration of subsystems or systems and operations of the systems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Named for the planet in &#8220;Babylon 5,&#8221; Epsilon3 could become an integral part of the rocket missions that eventually do explore other worlds. At least, that&#8217;s the bet that firms like Stage Venture Partners and MaC Ventures are making with their early $1.8 million investment into the business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Epislon3&#8217;s early customers are coming from early-stage space companies that are using the platform for live launches. These would be companies like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/stoke-space-wants-to-take-reusable-rockets-to-new-heights-with-9m-seed/"> Stoke Space</a> and other new rocket entrants. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;For us, space and deep tech is hot,&#8221; said MaC Ventures co-founder and managing partner, Adrian Fenty. The former mayor of Washington noted the combination of Mednik&#8217;s serial entrepreneur status and Crabtree&#8217;s deep, deep expertise in the field.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We had been looking at operating systems in general and thinking that there would be some good ones coming along,&#8221; Fenty said. In Epsilon3 the company found the combination of deep space, deep tech and a thesis around developing verticalized operating systems that ticked all the boxes. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;In doing diligence for the company&#8230; you just see how big space is and will become as a business,&#8221; said Michael Palank, a co-founder and managing partner at MaC Ventures predecessor, M Ventures alongside Fenty. &#8220;A lot of the challenges here on Earth will and only can be solved in space. And you need better operating systems to manage getting to and from space.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In New York City, if you order a toasted bagel with cream cheese at a deli, you have to pay sales tax. Ask for that same bagel unprepared? You won’t. In Illinois, candy is subject to sales tax, but candy with flour is considered a regular grocery item. Meaning: A Kit Kat is tax-free, but M&amp;Ms will cost you extra. And in Colorado, your daily coffee cup is considered essential packaging, while the lid is not, making it subject to a nonessential packaging tax.</p>
<p>These examples may seem trivial, but they illustrate the idiosyncrasies of sales tax — a fee consumers pay on their purchases that must ultimately be reconciled with the appropriate jurisdictions. Though sales tax is arguably the most complex type of indirect tax, businesses must also contend with other indirect taxes such as use tax, property tax and value-added tax (VAT).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Such taxes may be easy to understand conceptually, but their calculation is convoluted in practice — particularly for sales tax, which is governed by <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/state-sales-tax-jurisdictions-in-the-us-2020/">more than 11,000</a> unique jurisdictions in the U.S. alone. There is no reliable methodology businesses can use to calculate annual remittances based on previous years’ accounting formulas because local tax code changes as much as 25% every year.</p>
<p>For large corporations, sales tax compliance drives sky-high financial planning and analysis spending, and small businesses face an even worse predicament because they can neither afford outsourced tax preparation nor have the expertise to handle this filing. No matter a company’s size, failure to pay the correct amount of sales tax can result in severe penalties and even bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Now, a new legion of startups is emerging to help companies manage the intricacies of indirect taxes, including <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/">TaxJar</a>, <a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/">Taxdoo</a> and <a href="https://www.fonoatech.com/">Fonoa</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Why does this matter now?</strong></h2>
<p>Smaller businesses have, until fairly recently, managed to limp through tax season by selling goods and services locally, and thus operating within relatively consolidated tax jurisdictions. But e-commerce changed this in at least two profound ways.</p>
<p>The first is that even the smallest businesses have transformed from simple brick-and-mortar ventures to complex entities transacting in multiple places online, including via their own storefronts and websites, third-party vendors such as Amazon and Etsy, and wholesale channels. Previously, a small business may have calculated a single type of sales tax — traditionally for storefront enterprises. Now, they may have to calculate different taxes across an increasing number of channels and their resulting tax codes.</p>
<p>Second, e-commerce expanded companies’ geographic reach, allowing them to sell across state and country lines. Until recently, this was an unqualified advantage to small businesses, which benefited from outdated laws requiring most businesses to pay taxes only where they had established nexus, or physical presence. But the 2018 Supreme Court case of South Dakota v. Wayfair put an end to that, with the court ruling that businesses with digital revenue levels above a certain threshold must pay taxes in all states and municipalities in which they sell.</p>
<p>To a large extent, businesses have met the resulting increase in their tax obligations either sloppily or not at all. But the economic fallout from the pandemic is making such noncompliance far less tenable as state and local governments face fiscal shortfalls. With states traditionally relying on sales tax as a primary source of revenue (second only to federal receipts), local governments are beginning not only to enforce their tax codes more vigilantly but also to <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/covid-19-impacts-on-sales-tax-landscape">create new laws</a> that broaden the scope of taxable goods and services.</p>
<p>Given that the financial losses of the pandemic are projected to extend for years, it is unlikely states will revert to their previously relaxed standards of enforcement. Instead, it is far more plausible that COVID-19 will prove an opportunity for states to find new ways to capitalize on sales taxes related to e-commerce.</p>

Clearly, it’s the future, but what is it, and how can you turn your organization into a no-code company to get ahead of the trend?</p>
<p>No-code is changing how organizations build and maintain applications. It democratizes application development by creating “citizen developers” who can quickly build out applications that meet their business-facing needs in real time, realigning IT and business objectives by bringing them closer together than ever.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</p>
<p>Anyone can now create and modify their own tools without complex coding skills using no-code’s easy-to-use visual interfaces and drag-and-drop functionality. This creates organizational flexibility and agility, addresses growing IT backlogs and budgets, and helps fill the IT gap caused by a shortage of skilled developers.</p>
<p>Despite the many benefits, adopting a no-code platform won’t suddenly turn you into a no-code company. It’s a process. Here are three steps to help your transition:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Future-proof your tech strategy</strong></h2>
<p>For a long time, the threat of digital disruption and the subsequent need for digital transformation has been driving IT strategy. The pandemic made this threat all the more acute. Most organizations were forced to rapidly rethink their tech strategy in the new digital normal.</p>
<p>This strategy has been effective for many organizations, but it’s also been largely reactive. Organizations have been fighting to keep up with the acceleration of digital trends. The opportunity with no-code, which is still in its early days, is to make that tech strategy more proactive.</p>
<p>We find that many organizations still think about tech strategy from a predominantly IT lens without considering organizational structural changes that could be around the corner. Think about it: Having a critical mass of citizen developers in five years could dramatically change how your organization allocates resources, organizes departments and even hires talent.</p>
<p>Don’t future-proof your tech strategy for a slightly evolved version of your current organization, future-proof it for a fundamentally more democratized environment where everyone can build their own applications for their own needs. That’s a profound change. Here are three things to consider:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>, Atlassian&#8217;s wiki-like collaborative workspace, has been around for more than 15 years, and is often a core knowledge-sharing tool for the companies that implement it. But for the most part, Confluence is a business tool and looks like it, with walls of text and the occasional graph, table or image. But user expectations have changed, and so it&#8217;s maybe no major surprise that Atlassian is now bringing a stronger emphasis on design to the service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/confluence/supercharge-content-in-confluence">update</a>, for example, brings to the service features like cover images, title emojis and customizable space avatars (that is, &#8220;icons that <span style="font-weight: 400;">denote a &#8216;space&#8217; or section of Confluence&#8221;)</span>. The team also recently introduced smart links, which allow you to paste links from services like YouTube and Trello and have the service immediately recognize them and display them in their native format. Other new features include the ability to schedule when a new page is published and the ability to convert pages to blog posts (because, as it turns out, Atlassian has seen a bit of a resurgence in corporate blogging &#8212; mostly for internal audiences &#8212; during the pandemic).</p>

<p>&#8220;We ended up doing something that we called &#8216;love sprint,&#8217; where we prioritize about 30 features for the enhancements, which are all &#8212; if you think about the themes &#8212; about how you design information in this world where you have to read more, where you have to write more,&#8221; Natalia Baryshnikova, the head Of Product Management for Atlassian&#8217;s Confluence Experience Group, told me. &#8220;And there&#8217;s the attention span that&#8217;s kind of pushing its limits. So how do you design for that situation? How do you discover our content?&#8221;</p>
<p>Baryshnikova tells me that the team took a close look at how content production, management and delivery works in the social media world. But some of the new features are also purely a reaction to a changing work environment. Take the ability to schedule when pages are published, for example. Employees who work from home may work especially late or early right now, for example, in order to prioritize childcare. But they still want the content they produce to be seen inside the company, and that can be hard when you would otherwise publish it at 11 p.m., for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png" alt="" width="1024" height="592" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>And having your content get noticed is getting harder because Confluence usage has dramatically increased in the last 12 months. As Atlassian noted today, more than 60,000 companies are now using the service. And inside those companies, those users are also far more active than ever before. The number of Confluence pages created from March 2020 to March 2021 increased by more than 33%. The average user now creates 11% more pages, but the product&#8217;s superusers have often doubled or tripled their output.</p>
<p>The use of Confluence has also helped many companies reduce their number of meetings, but as Baryshnikova noted, &#8220;not only are pages competing with meetings &#8212; but pages are competing with pages.&#8221; So using good graphics, for example, is a way for a user&#8217;s content to stand out in the noise of corporate content production. Which, I have to admit, strikes me as a somewhat strange dynamic. But I guess that just like on the web, in order to stand out in a corporate environment, you have to make the documents you produce stand out in order to get noticed. Maybe that &#8212; as well as the lack of watercooler conversations &#8212; is also the reason corporate blogging is seeing an uptick right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad is the latest proptech company to go public via a SPAC merger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix, Ariz.-based company announced Thursday its plans to go public by merging with Supernova Partners Acquisition Company in a deal valued at $3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction is expected to close in the second, or early third, quarter of 2021. The combined company will be named Offerpad Solutions and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “OPAD.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, Offerpad started out as primarily an iBuyer (meaning it bought homes from sellers who signed up online) and has since evolved its platform in an effort to be a one-stop shop for people looking to buy or sell a home. For example, it now also offers home improvement advances, as well as title and mortgage services. The company has raised $155 million in equity funding from investors such as LL Funds, in addition to hundreds of millions more in debt over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Offerpad says it has completed 30,000 transactions and achieved nearly $7 billion in gross transaction volume. The company projects it will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generate revenue of $1.4 billion this year, up from an estimated $1.1 billion in 2020. That compares to revenue of  $100 million in 2016. Offerpad also says it has had &#8220;positive per-home contribution margins&#8221; since 2016. </span></p>
<p>The company has ambitious goals, projecting revenue of $2.4 billion in 2022 and $3.9 billion in 2023. It is currently active in 16 markets, recently adding <a href="https://blog.offerpad.com/welcome-denver-and-nashville-to-the-offerpad-family/">Denver and Nashville</a> to the list.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supernova Partners, which spun up the SPAC for this deal, is led by Spencer Rascoff &#8212; a serial entrepreneur with plenty of prop tech experience who co-founded Hotwire, Zillow, dot.LA and Pacaso, and who led Zillow as CEO for nearly a decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIPE investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Zimmer Partners, as well as national homebuilder Taylor Morrison Home Corp.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="41NRwgVgUH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">This is a good time to start a proptech company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This is a good time to start a proptech company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/embed/#?secret=41NRwgVgUH" data-secret="41NRwgVgUH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad says that by partnering with Supernova to become a public company, it expects it will be able “to accelerate its growth to capture more” of the market. The company currently operates in over 900 cities and towns across the country and plans to expand nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rascoff believes Offerpad “is incredibly well-positioned to grab a huge piece” of the online real estate market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“iBuying has barely scratched the surface of real estate, one of the biggest addressable markets in the world,” he said in a written statement. “In general, real estate continues to be mostly analog, in contrast to other industries like grocery, autos and pharmaceuticals, but consumers demand online solutions. As they bring more transactions online, we believe online real estate as a whole is poised to grow rapidly in the coming years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad competes with companies such as Opendoor, Redfin and Zillow, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the transaction, existing Offerpad shareholders will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company and are expected to own approximately 75% of the combined entity at closing. Offerpad’s founder and CEO Brian Bair will receive high-vote stock that is expected to represent approximately 35% of the voting power of the combined company.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this month, real estate tech startup Doma, formerly known as <a href="https://www.statestitle.com/">States Title</a>, announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/proptech-startup-states-title-now-doma-going-public-via-spac-in-3b-deal/">go public</a> through a merger with SPAC Capitol Investment Corp. V in a deal valued at $3 billion, including debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vega.xyz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a decentralized protocol for creating and trading on derivatives markets, has raised $5 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrington Capital and Cumberland DRW co-led the round, which also included participation from Coinbase Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Signum Capital, CMT Digital, CMS Holdings, Three Commas and a slew of others. The new investment brings Vega’s total funding raised to more than $10 million, according to Crunchbase </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vega-protocol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega founder Barney Mannerings launched the Vega project in 2018 with the mission of giving anyone the ability to create and launch a derivatives market. The company claims that by eliminating centralized gatekeepers and decentralizing governance, it can allow for instant settlement, remove conflict of interest from markets, reduce fees and enable the throughput necessary for high-volume derivatives trading. In short, it claims to be realizing the promise of blockchain technology applied to financial business models, which is mostly around eliminating operators sitting in the middle that essentially profit mainly by passing money from one party to another.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By allowing anyone to create and launch a derivatives market, we aim to give people the tools they need to hedge risks unique to their region, profession or situation,&#8221; Mannerings said. &#8220;Derivatives trading has been a pillar of traditional finance for a long time, but DeFi has not been able to achieve the capital efficiency and throughput required to make decentralized derivatives trading viable, until now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Vega is still under development. The startup launched its &#8220;t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estnet&#8221; (a testing version of its network, as the name implies) in the second quarter of 2020 and has had a number of iterations since.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZWRM9V7iZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/embed/#?secret=AZWRM9V7iZ" data-secret="AZWRM9V7iZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital on resources “to ship and test high-quality code,” among other things. This summer, Vega is gearing up to launch a “mainnet-ready” release of its protocol code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Mannerings said the company expects to see the first validators launch a Vega network that plugs into the Ethereum mainnet for the first time, allowing trading of real crypto assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company’s wallet software that is required to access the testnet is free and open-sourced, meaning that anyone can download to create a wallet and use the testnet. Vega has so far given out around 500 IDs for its hosted wallet, which allows people to use testnet without running the wallet themselves. There have been other IDs created, but the company has not been able to track just how many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjan Vinod, investment analyst at investor ParaFi Capital, said his firm is both a DeFi investor and user and, as such, has been monitoring the evolution of new blockchain-based financial primitives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The multi-trillion dollar derivatives market has been a missing piece in the core DeFi stack,” he wrote via email. “Leveraging a proof of stake protocol, integrated liquidity incentives, and permissionless market creation, Vega is bringing a novel and first-principles approach to decentralized derivatives. Vega disrupts the intermediaries traditionally controlling market creation, settlement, collateral management, and pricing in the derivatives market.”</span></p>
