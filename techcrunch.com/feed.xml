										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced earnings today after the bell, it revealed that it&#8217;s buying cloud identity startup Auth0 for a hefty $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, Okta gets a cloud identity company that helps developers embed identity management into applications, adding an entirely new dimension to its identity platform. &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re taking a significant step forward — I&#8217;d go so far to call it a &#8220;leap&#8221; — to enhance the Okta Identity Cloud. We announced our agreement to join forces with Auth0, a leading identity platform for developers,&#8221; Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon wrote in <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2021/03/okta-auth0-powering-identity-for-the-internet/">a blog post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>Auth0 users can breathe a sigh of relief in that McKinnon writes that the company will operate as an independent unit inside of Okta as they look for paths to integration in the coming months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eugenio Pace, co-founder and CEO Auth0 sees his company together with Okta as powerful combination in the identity management space, and he&#8217;s not just hyping the deal when he says that. &#8220;Together, we can offer our customers workforce and customer identity solutions with exceptional speed, simplicity, security, reliability and scalability. By joining forces, we will accelerate our customers’ innovation and ability to meet the needs and demands of consumers, businesses and employees everywhere,&#8221; Pace said in a statement.</p>
<p><em>This is a breaking story. More to come.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toro this week announced its<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302005210/en/The-Toro-Company-Acquires-Left-Hand-Robotics-Inc."> intentions to acquire Left Hand Robotics</a>. The Colorado-based startup (not to be confused with Righthand Robotics) is a natural fit for the lawn mowing giant, as the producer of the RT-1000, an autonomous system capable of mowing large lawns and clearing snow from sidewalks.</p>
<p>Toro is best known for its personal and professional mowers and various other landscaping machines. The company also has some experience in the robotic category, beating various competitors to the punch by a decade or two with its iMow, but those efforts don’t appear to have made a major dent in its overall offerings.</p>
<p>Left Hand’s primary offering targets professionals. It’s already a category for its new parent company, though it’s easy to see how it might scale down as personal mowers gain in popularity. The RT-1000 is a fully autonomous system designed for a variety of weather conditions that could make a more compact version an appealing option for users &#8212; assuming the companies are able to shrink the cost accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition comes as companies like John Deere are strategizing their own approach toward robotics, while devoted companies like iRobot have begun to explore the space. Although iRobot’s own mower was delayed due to COVID-19, the Roomba maker believes it has cracked what’s proven to be a difficult market for many.</p>
<p>Left Hand has raised $8.9 million to date. Details of the transaction have not been disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is rolling out a new experience for its Fire TV platform that puts more focus on subscription-free streaming and other live content. The company today announced several new services are being integrated into its suite of Live features, including Xumo and its own IMDb TV and Amazon news app. The company also soon plans to add Plex, it notes.</p>
<p>All four of the services are available for free with ads and don&#8217;t require a subscription, Amazon says. These channels and their content will appear in Fire TV&#8217;s Live tab in the &#8220;On Now&#8221; rows, as well as in the Universal Channel Guide on the Fire TV app.</p>
<p>With the additions, Amazon says there are now over 400 live streaming channels from across 20 providers that can be accessed from Fire TV&#8217;s live channel guide &#8212; including services like YouTube TV, Sling TV, Tubi, Pluto TV, Philo, Prime Video Channels, Prime Video Live Events (like Thursday Night Football), and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon also notes that more than 200 of those channels are available for free with ads, and don&#8217;t need a subscription to watch.</p>
<p>Free, live streaming content is becoming a battleground for both Amazon and Roku, the top two streaming media platforms in the U.S. But they&#8217;re taking different approaches to the format.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s section showcasing free, live content has become more of a part of its overall Fire TV interface, instead of a separate channel you have to launch. This speaks to Amazon&#8217;s design philosophy with Fire TV, whose interface largely resembles that of a streaming service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve always taken a content-forward approach when designing Fire TV. When you turn on your TV, you’re going to see shows, movies, and sports — not just rows of apps,&#8221; said VP &amp; GM of Amazon Fire TV, Sandeep Gupta. &#8220;This philosophy extends to our approach to live content. We’re continuing to invest heavily in Live TV and so are our content partners. We’re expanding that today with the addition of new integrations, Alexa capabilities, and enhanced content discovery mechanisms,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roku offers its own hub with always-on free movies and TV shows, called The Roku Channel, which helps to serve as a starting point for cord cutters who are looking for something to watch after they&#8217;ve ditched traditional pay TV. But unlike Fire TV, Roku&#8217;s design is, in fact,  &#8220;rows of apps.&#8221; This makes its interface simple to use and less cluttered &#8212; something many people seem to prefer. Here, The Roku Channel is just another app to launch, not a part of the Roku interface.</p>
<p>Roku also makes The Roku Channel available online and as a standalone mobile app, just like other free streaming services. And this week, it <a href="https://blog.roku.com/easier-web-access-to-free-content-on-the-roku-channel">integrated</a> most of The Roku Channel&#8217;s free content with its main Roku.com website, in order to reach more consumers.</p>
<p>Separately, Fire TV offers its own app, but limits itself to live content, not on-demand, ad-supported shows and movies.</p>
<p>In addition to today&#8217;s newly announced live TV integrations, Amazon also says its live TV programs are now Alexa-enabled.</p>
<p>That means you can say things like &#8220;Alexa, play Good Morning America&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, play the Seahawks game,&#8221; to launch a specific live TV program by name. This will work with the Alexa Voice Remote, on the Fire TV Cube, and with Fire TVs paired with an Echo device.</p>
<p>Live TV programs will also appear in the &#8220;App Peak&#8221; (hover) feature on the newly updated Fire TV interface. This feature will show you what&#8217;s on a given channel when you hover over it in the main navigation, and works on Fire TV Stick (3rd gen.) and Fire TV Stick Lite, for the time being.</p>
<p>As a result of its expansions and live TV integrations &#8212; not to mention the pandemic that&#8217;s kept people at home for entertainment &#8212; Amazon says that engagement with live streaming apps on Fire TV has more than doubled in the last 12 months, up by over 130%.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new features are rolling out today to Fire TV devices.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our startup is planning on registering an international student employee in this year’s H-1B lottery. This will be our first H-1B. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you help demystify the H-1B process and provide any tips? We also want to hire an Australian and transfer their E-3. How quickly can this be done?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Plucky in Pleasanton</strong></p>
<p>Dear Plucky:</p>
<p>Thanks for your timely questions! There’s some great news for Australian citizens currently in the U.S. and looking for job transfers, amendments and extensions. Premium processing is now available for the E-3 working visa category! This means that transfers, changes of status, and extensions of status for Australians in the U.S. seeking an E-3 can now obtain adjudications from USCIS in as little as 15 days, making it much easier to hire an Australian who is currently in the U.S. for a new role. Go for it!</p>
<p>On the topic of H-1Bs, the registration period for this year’s H-1B lottery will open at 9 a.m. PST on March 9 and will close at 9 a.m. on March 25. Startups need to make sure they’re registering anybody they want to sponsor during this window. Take a listen to my recent podcast on H-1B Lottery Planning, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/055-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">Part 2</a>, for a general explanation of how this year’s process will work and how best to prepare.</p>
<p>Planning is key for implementing a successful immigration strategy. As always, I suggest you consult with an experienced immigration attorney ASAP to help get organized for registering your H-1B candidate for the March lottery and doing as much prep work as possible so that you can put together a strong H-1B petition in the event your candidate is selected in the lottery.</p>
<p>An attorney will also be up to date on all the recent changes to immigration policy, such as USCIS rescinding a Trump-era policy that went into effect in 2017 that effectively made <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/h-1b/computer-programming/">computer programming positions ineligible for an H-1B visa</a>. You will also want to discuss backup options for the international student employee if they are not selected in this year’s lottery.</p>

<h2>Registration and lottery process</h2>
<p>Recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it will delay until next year the plan to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based one that would have selected registrants who would be paid the highest wage for their position and location. In January, the previous administration had finalized the rule implementing the wage-based lottery. The latest announcement ended weeks of speculation whether USCIS under the Biden administration would retain a wage-based H-1B allocation process, which falls in line with President Biden’s presidential campaign platform.</p>
<p>The random H-1B lottery in March means that H-1B candidates with the same education level who will be paid more will have no greater advantage than those being paid less. However, next year that may not be the case.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there’s a random or wage-based lottery, individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university will continue to have the best chance of being selected in the H-1B lottery. The annual cap on H-1Bs remains at 85,000 and of those, 20,000 H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. USCIS randomly selects enough registered candidates from the entire pool of registrants to reach the 65,000 regular H-1B cap first. Then it randomly selects another 20,000 registered candidates holding a U.S. master’s degree or higher, in what is called the advanced-degree cap exemption. Therefore, individuals with a U.S. advanced degree have two chances to be selected. To be eligible, your international student employee must have earned their advanced degree from an eligible and accredited U.S. institution by the time the H-1B petition is filed.</p>
<p>After the online registration period closes on March 25, USCIS will conduct a random computerized selection of registrations and will notify those selected by March 31. A completed H-1B petition must be filed within 90 days of being notified that the H-1B candidate was selected in the lottery, which means the filing deadline will be June 30.</p>
<p>In order to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-electronic-registration-process">register</a> your candidate for the H-1B lottery, your company will need to set up an <a href="https://myaccount.uscis.gov/users/sign_up">online USCIS account</a> if it does not already have one. This can be done at any time between now and the end of the registration period. Your attorney can help you with this and the online registration process.</p>
<p>For the online registration process, your company will have to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full legal name of the candidate.</li>
<li>Gender.</li>
<li>Date of birth.</li>
<li>Country of birth.</li>
<li>Country of citizenship.</li>
<li>Passport number.</li>
<li>If the candidate is eligible for inclusion in the U.S. advanced-degree cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, your company will have to pay the $10 registration fee, which can be submitted by entering a credit card, debit card, checking or savings account directly into the H-1B registration portal.</p>
<h2>Tips for preparing</h2>
<p>Generally, your startup and your H-1B candidate should start assembling documents you will need to submit. Your startup will need to get its tax identification number verified by the U.S. Department of Labor to prove that your startup is capable of sponsoring an individual for an H-1B. This needs to be done before your company can submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA), which is also sent to the Labor Department. An approved LCA must be submitted with your H-1B petition to USCIS. In addition to your startup’s tax ID, it will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your startup formed recently, articles of incorporation, pitch deck, business plan, term sheet, cap tables.</li>
<li>Documentation showing your company can pay the prevailing wage for the H-1B candidate’s position and location: bank statements, tax returns, other financial documents.</li>
<li>Documents to prove your company is operating within the normal course of business, including marketing materials, company reports, screenshots of the company website.</li>
<li>Job offer letter to the H-1B candidate, including job title, detailed duties, benefits, salary and start date.</li>
<li>Minimum requirements for the position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your H-1B candidate will need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date resume.</li>
<li>Originals of diplomas, certificates, and transcripts (also scanned copies).</li>
<li>Past immigration documents, such as Form I-20 (certificate of eligibility for F-1 student status) or Form DS-2019 (certificate of eligibility for J-1 status.</li>
<li>Translations of any documents not in English along with a certified translation document.</li>
</ul>
<p>For tips for filing the H-1B petition, listen to my podcast episodes on “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">Your Startup’s First H-1B</a>” and “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.” Your attorney will be able to make the case that your H-1B candidate and the position your startup is offering meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B specialty occupation visa</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, premium processing for H-1B petitions remains available. Currently, USCIS is severely backlogged in all case types, so I often suggest using it, depending on the H-1B candidate’s start date and current geographic location. With premium processing, which is an optional service for a $2,500 fee, USCIS guarantees it will make a decision on a case within 15 days. If USCIS approves your H-1B petition, the earliest the international student employee can begin working under the H-1B visa is Oct. 1, 2022, which is the first day of the federal government’s new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for you in this year’s H-1B lottery</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a devoted coffee drinker I was enthused by the idea of <a href="https://www.bottomless.com/">Bottomless</a>. The <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/11944">Y Combinator-backed</a> startup sends its users coffee as they run low so that they never run out of the Magic Juice of Life. What could be better?</p>
<p>Because life is somewhat funny, after signing up for its service the company reached out to share that it had raised a Series A. So I got on the phone with <a href="https://twitter.com/lianakherrera">Liana Herrera</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder, to chat about the startup, which is part coffee-sourcing engine, part subscription/e-commerce play and part hardware effort.</p>
<p>So before we talk about its Series A, let&#8217;s work better to understand what Bottomless is building, and how it works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s Bottomless?</h2>
<p>Born from its founders&#8217; issues ordering the right amount of Soylent when they actually needed it, and wondering why there wasn&#8217;t a better way to subscribe to goods consumed on a regular basis, Herrera uncovered the idea for Bottomless.</p>
<p>Today the product works by letting users pick the type of coffee they are interested in, be it caffeine level, price and the like. The company then provides customers with a small digital scale that they connect to their home internet. And then as users consume coffee that Bottomless sends them, placing the bag on the hardware in between uses, the scale notes how much is left and orders more before they run out.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120480" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120480" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120480 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg 896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120480" class="wp-caption-text">A Bottomless scale, via the company as my kitchen lighting is bad.</p></div></p>
<p>You can set the sensitivity of the scale, asking it to either be ambitious in keeping you from running out of beans or ground coffee, or more relaxed. As I write to you today, I think that my third bag of decaf has arrived. It&#8217;s a neat system.</p>
<p>And from a business perspective, the Bottomless model has plusses. I honestly do not recall the price range of coffee that I picked, and do not know how much I am actually paying Bottomless at the moment. But I do know that having different types of coffee arrive at the house as I run low is pretty damn cool.</p>
<p>To make that happen, however, is not easy. The startup&#8217;s business is a little complex. Before and even after Bottomless went through Y Combinator back in 2019, the company hand-built its coffee-weighing scales. Herrera told TechCrunch that the old Silicon Valley saw that hardware is hard is in fact an understatement. After all the soldering she described during an interview, I believe her.</p>
<p>Still, after finishing the accelerator program the company managed to grow in 2019 by what Herrera said was around 10x. That customer expansion allowed the company to order bulk hardware from China in early 2020. After its first production run finished &#8212; a few thousand units &#8212; COVID-19 shut down that country&#8217;s supply chain. Happily for the startup, by the time COVID-19 had taken over America, the Chinese economy opened up and production could begin again.</p>
<p>Per the company, Bottomless scaled another 5-7x in 2020. An <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/23/business/bottomless-coffee-subscription-boom/index.html">October 2020 CNN piece</a> notes that the company had around 750 customers in late 2019, and some 6,000 by the time of publication. Herrera wants to massively expand that number, telling TechCrunch that she&#8217;d like to grow by 10x again this year, and that 5x expansion was the lower-end of her expectations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2vinAtVNCs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/this-unique-vacuum-extraction-coffee-maker-is-colombias-own/">This unique vacuum-extraction coffee maker is Colombia&#8217;s own</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This unique vacuum-extraction coffee maker is Colombia&#8217;s own&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/this-unique-vacuum-extraction-coffee-maker-is-colombias-own/embed/#?secret=2vinAtVNCs" data-secret="2vinAtVNCs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Powering that growth are a host of coffee companies that Bottomless works with. Those companies handle roasting the beans and sending them to different Bottomless customers. So that no one reaches a zero-coffee state. And dies. Or whatever happens when one actually runs out of coffee.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that there are some 500 roasters on their wait list, implying that it will have the capacity to take on more customers this year.</p>
<p>Despite all the growth, the company still has some edges to refine. Setting up Wi-Fi on my scale wasn&#8217;t super-simple, for example. Herrera did note that her firm has a new scale coming out in the next three months. That could lower the difficulty barrier for new customers. Still, with 6,000 customers last October ordering three to four bags of coffee monthly, per Herrera&#8217;s estimate, the company had reached a comfortable seven-figure GMV run-rate before 2021 began.</p>
<p>For coffee roasters who may have seen their customer base slow during the pandemic, and consumers increasingly willing to dive into e-commerce, the company&#8217;s model could have long-term legs. Which brings us to the investors making that bet.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>Bottomless raised a $4.5 million Series A in January of 2021. It&#8217;s a smaller A than we tend to see in recent years, but Herrera said that her company has always been scrappy, which we take to mean that it has a history of being frugal. <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag">Patrick OShaughnessy</a> led the round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked if the $4.5 million was a lot of money for the startup, as we didn&#8217;t have a clear picture at the time of its fundraising history. Herrera said that Bottomless has gotten to where it is today on just $2 million. So, the Series A is more than double all the money that the company as raised to date. It&#8217;s a lot of money, in other words.</p>
<p>Besides the new scale design, when asked about what the company intends to do with its funds, Herrera detailed the type of person she&#8217;s looking to hire &#8212; namely intellectually flexible folks who are informal, scrappy and very hack-y. More staff, in other words.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far Bottomless can get with its new check. Apparently I will be helping its KPIs for the foreseeable future as a customer.</p>

<p>With all that pressure to make an impact quickly, founders spend an incredible amount of time on the design of their slides. Less consideration, however, is usually spent on the <i>words </i>on the slide. That’s a mistake, especially when you only have 170 seconds.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Founders spend an incredible amount of time on the design of their slides. Less consideration, however, is usually spent on the words on the slide. That’s a mistake.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When not used intentionally, the words in your deck can be distracting or downright off-putting. We used what we know about language and healthy communication from the millions of documents we’ve processed at <a href="http://writer.com">Writer</a> to come up with 11 words and phrases to remove from your VC pitch deck.</p>
<h2>Negative associations</h2>
<h3>1. “r<b>unway”</b></h3>
<p>Pitching VCs is a balancing act: You want to position your idea in the best light, but also show that you’ve thought things through. However, volunteering certain types of information can have the opposite effect. Don’t write: <i>I’m seeking $X in funding to provide Y months of runway</i>. You certainly need to show how you’re going to use the funding you’re asking for, but you don’t want to frame things in terms of <i>runway</i> in a pitch deck. The word is associated with a looming cash-out date, which can put an investor in a negative state of mind.</p>
<p><i>This </i><a href="https://www.happysignals.com/leading-experience-management-platform-for-it-happysignals"><i>HappySignal</i></a><i> slide is a solid example of keeping your messaging positive and using uplifting language.</i></p>
<h3>2. “e<b>xit strategy”</b></h3>
<p>Don’t write: <i>Our exit strategy is … . </i>Yes, thinking through your business means knowing how you’ll handle worst-case and best-case scenarios. But putting <i>exit strategy</i> in your deck can only get investors thinking about the inherent risks. You want them focused on the opportunity. You need to know what to say when the topic comes up — just don’t volunteer the information on a slide.</p>
<h2>Clichés</h2>
<h3>3. “j<b>ust X percent”</b></h3>
<p>A pitch deck is a tool to show VCs why your idea merits investment. Using clichés can work against that goal. Don’t write: <i>If we could capture X percent of the market … .</i> It’s not only a cliché, it’s wishful thinking — not a plan. Keep the text on your slides grounded in relevant facts and figures. Other clichés to cut include: <i>the Amazon of X</i>, <i>imagine a future</i> and <i>moving Y to blockchain</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At <a href="https://events.flutter.dev/">an online event</a>, Google today announced <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter 2</a>, the newest version of its open-source UI toolkit for building portable apps. While Flutter started out with a focus on mobile when it first launched two years ago, it spread its wings in recent years and with version 2, Flutter now supports web and desktop apps out of the box. With that, Flutter users can now use the same codebase to build apps for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux and the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big thing that justifies the major version number shift is, of course, the availability of web and desktop support,&#8221; Flutter product lead Tim Sneath told me. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just a fairly profound pivot. It&#8217;s rare for products that you suddenly have all these additional endpoints.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120462" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120462" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png 1615w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=1536,759 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120462" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He noted that because of Flutter&#8217;s open-source nature, web and desktop support had been &#8220;cooking in the open&#8221; for a while, so the addition of these endpoints isn&#8217;t a surprise. A lot of that work in getting these new platforms ready for the 2.0 release involved getting the performance up to par on these new platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that Flutter desktop support is still behind an early-release flag in Flutter&#8217;s stable release channel and Google says developers should think of it as a &#8220;beta snapshot.&#8221; Web support, however, has transitioned from beta to stable and has become just another target for building apps with Flutter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png 1374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>On the web platform, specifically, Sneath noted that the team deliberately started out with a very standard, DOM-centric approach. But while that worked fine, it also meant performance was held back by that, especially for more advanced features. Over the course of the last year or so, the team started working on what it calls Canvas Kit. This WebAssembly-based project takes the same <a href="https://skia.org/user/modules/canvaskit">Skia graphics engine</a> that powers Android and Chrome itself and makes it available <a href="https://flutterplasma.dev/">to web apps</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What that&#8217;s meant is that we can now essentially bypass the core HTML &#8212; sort of the document-centric parts of the web platform &#8212; and really use the app-centric parts of the web platform without leaving [behind] things like auto-complete of text or passwords and all the things that keep the web feeling very unique,&#8221; Sneath said.</p>

<p>On the desktop, Google is announcing that Canonical is going all-in on Flutter and making it the default choice of all its future desktop and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft, too, is expanding its support for Flutter and working with Google on Windows support for Flutter. Given Microsoft&#8217;s interest in Android, that&#8217;s maybe no huge surprise, and indeed, Microsoft today is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/flutter-dual-screen-foldable/">releasing contributions to the Flutter engine</a> to help support foldable Android devices.</p>
<p>In total, Google notes, there are now over 15,000 packages for Flutter and Dart from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Huawei, Alibaba, eBay and Square.</p>
<p>As always, there are dozen of other smaller updates to Flutter in this update, too.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Sneath noted that the Flutter team plans to spend more time on Flutter as a framework for embedded devices and other somewhat nontraditional platforms. He also noted that the team is interested in how Flutter can help power ambient computing experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we think about the ambient computing worlds where there are these core premises behind the ambient computing aspects &#8212; things like: Can it be searched easily? Can people make money off of the apps that they build and do it in a responsible way? We&#8217;re building support for those kinds of services. Better analytics, better ads frameworks, connectivity into things like Firebase and Google Cloud, so that people can not just take advantage of Flutter but the broader ecosystem services that Google provides,&#8221; Sneath explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.postscript.io">Postscript</a> helps Shopify stores stay in touch with customers via SMS, with a focus on keeping everything opt-in, legally compliant, and spam free. The company raised $4.5M back at the end of 2019; this morning it&#8217;s announcing it has raised a $35M Series B.</p>
<p>The company has grown pretty rapidly over the last year. When we last checked in with them<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/postscript-raises-4-5m-to-help-shopify-shops-stay-connected-with-customers-over-sms/"> in December of 2019</a>, they had 14 employees and around 530 customers; today, they&#8217;re at 61 employees with over 3,500 customers.</p>
<p>Their vision for the product has grown a bit over the last year as well. Initially envisioned as more of a one-way broadcasting for Shopify stores to market to existing customers (&#8220;Look! We&#8217;ve got new shoes in stock!&#8221;), they&#8217;re now working on expanding into more two-way interactions, enabling customers to do things like re-orders, subscription management, and reviews through SMS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As before, Postscript is compatible exclusively with Shopify stores. Behind the scenes they&#8217;ve been building out an API to allow deeper integrations into other Shopify plugins — but still, they&#8217;re all about Shopify merchants for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still focused exclusively there,&#8221; Postscript co-founder Alex Beller tells me. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s kind of our secret sauce, honestly, because we go so deep with the data and the ecosystem. There&#8217;s just a lot of tiny accumulating advantages there. It&#8217;s also the platform that&#8217;s growing the fastest in e-commerce, so it&#8217;s been a good place to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the company&#8217;s December 2019 funding was a seed round, co-founder Adam Turner tells me that between the size of the round and the revenue the company is seeing, they&#8217;ve skipped the A round and have structured this one as a Series B.</p>
<p>The round was led by Greylock, and backed by YC, 1984vc, Ali Capital, Elephant VC, and Larry Fitzgerald. As part of the deal, Greylock partners Sarah Guo and Mike Duboe will be joining Postscript&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>GSV Ventures, co-founded by Deborah Quazzo and Michael Cohn, has raised $180 million in its second fund, exclusively focused on backing edtech startups across the globe. The startup now manages $277 million in cumulative assets, inclusive of its debut fund that was closed in 2016.</p>
<p>The new fund will let GSV invest in 13 core holdings, with an average check size of $15 million. The firm reserves up to $20 million per position for follow-on capital. It will invest in seed, Series A and late growth-stage opportunities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While edtech was certainly spotlighted by the pandemic’s impact on the adoption of remote education, GSV Ventures is a case study in what happens when you invest in a category before it has generalist eyes on it. The first fund had three of its largest positions in Coursera, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coursera-considers-going-public-2021-161155214.html">is planning to go public</a> this year; Course Hero, which was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">$1.1 billion last year</a>; and ClassDojo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">which finally hit profitability</a> after spending eight years focusing on customer growth instead of monetization.</p>
<p>The firm was also an early believer in Nearpod, which exited for $650 million in an all-cash deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/miami-edtech-startup-nearpod-acquired-by-renaissance/">in February 2021. </a>Quazzo, who contributed her angel portfolio into the fund, says that this gives the firm 10 exits under its belt to date.</p>

<p>GSV Ventures began around the same time as other exclusively-edtech funds launched, such as Reach Capital, Learn Capital and Owl Ventures. These funds have all closed new capital in the wake of the coronavirus, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/reach-capital-fund-3/">$165 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">$132 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">$585 million</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The biggest change between GSV Ventures’ debut fund and Fund II is the opportunity that Quazzo seeds internationally. Fund 1 only had one investment outside the United States, and Fund II already has holdings in Capetown, Croatia, Jordan, as well as, Quazzo confirms, six incoming investments split between Indonesia and India.</p>
<p>“There are very important businesses being built in these markets with missions to democratize and improve the delivery of learning at scale to all people,” Quazzo tells TechCrunch. To date, GSV Ventures’ portfolio has 37% female founders and 43% people of color.</p>
<p>While there was a four-year gap between Fund I and Fund II, GSV’s ability to back edtech startups with an ambitious trajectory hasn’t gone unnoticed. Its third fund, already mid-raise, will have its first close in the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A little over thirteen years ago, Shai Agassi, a promising software executive who was in line to succeed the chief executive at SAP, then one of the world&#8217;s mightiest software companies, left the company he&#8217;d devoted the bulk of his professional career to and started a business called Better Place.</p>
<p>That startup promised to revolutionize the nascent electric vehicle market and make range anxiety a thing of the past. The company&#8217;s pitch? A network of automated battery swapping stations that would replace spent batteries with freshly charged ones.</p>
<p>Agassi&#8217;s company would go on to raise nearly $1 billion (back when that was considered a large sum of money) from some of the world&#8217;s top venture capital and growth equity firms. By 2013 it would be bankrupt and one of the many casualties of the first wave of cleantech investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now serial entrepreneurs John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah are reviving the battery swapping business model with a startup called<a href="https://ample.com/"> Ample</a> and an approach that they say solves some of the problems that Better Place could never address at a time when the adoption of electric vehicles is creating a far larger addressable market.</p>
<p>In 2013, there were 220,000 vehicles on roads, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/270603/worldwide-number-of-hybrid-and-electric-vehicles-since-2009/">according to data from Statista</a>, a number which has grown to 4.8 million by 2019.</p>
<p>Ample has actually raised approximately $70 million from investors including Shell Ventures, the Spanish energy company Repsol, and the Moore Strategic Ventures, a venture firm which is the private held investment firm of Louis M. Bacon, founder of the multi-billion hedge fund, Moore Capital Management. That includes a $34 million investment <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ample-a-better-better-place">first reported back in 2018</a>, and a later round from investors including Japan&#8217;s energy and metals company, Eneos Holdings that closed recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of people that either said, I somehow was involved in that and was suffering from PTSD,&#8221; said de Souza, of the similarities between his business and Better Place. &#8220;The people who weren&#8217;t involved read up about it and then ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Ample, the difference is in the modularization of the battery pack and how that changes the relationship with the automakers that would use the technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The approach we’ve taken… is to modularize the battery and then we have an adapter plate that is the structural element of the battery that has the same shape of the battery, same bolt pattern and same software interface. Even though we provide the same battery system.. .it’s same as replacing the tire,&#8221; said Hassounah, Ample&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive. &#8220;Effectively we’re giving them the plate. We don’t modify the car whatsoever. You either put a fixed battery system or an Ample battery plate. We’re able to work with the OEMS where you can make the battery swappable for the use cases where this makes a lot of sense. Without really changing the same vehicle.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Ample&#8217;s currently working with five different OEMs and has validated its approach to battery swapping with nine different car models. One of those OEMs also brings back memories of Better Place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the company has a deal with Nissan for the Leaf thanks to the other partnership that Ample has announced with Uber. Ample&#8217;s founders declined to comment on any OEM relationships.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Ample is working with Nissan because Nissan is the company that<a href="https://www.uber.com/en-GB/newsroom/nissan-and-uber-advance-zero-emission-mobility/"> inked a deal with Uber earlier this year</a> on zero-emission mobility. And Uber is the first company to use Ample&#8217;s robotic charging stations at a few locations in the Bay Area, the company said. This work with Nissan echoes Better Place&#8217;s one partnership with Renault, another arm of the automaker, which proved to be the biggest deal for the older, doomed, battery swapping startup.</p>
<p>Ample says it only takes weeks to set up one of its charging pods at a facility and that the company&#8217;s charging drivers on energy delivered per mile. &#8220;We achieve economics that are 10% to 20% cheaper than gas. We are profitable on day one,&#8221; said Hassounah.</p>
<p>Uber is the first step. Ample is focused on fleets first and is in talks with multiple, undisclosed municipalities to get their cars added to the system. So far, Ample has done thousands of swaps, according to Hassounah with just Uber drivers alone.</p>
<p>The cars can also be charged at traditional charging facilities, Hassounah said, and the company&#8217;s billing system knows the split between the amount of energy it delivers versus another charging outlet, Hassounah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, in the use cases that we have, for ride sharing it&#8217;s individual drivers who pay,&#8221; said de Souza. With the five fleets that Ample expects to deploy with later this year the company expects to have the fleet managers and owners pay for. charging.</p>
<p>Some of the inspiration for Ample came from Hassounah&#8217;s earlier experience working at One laptop per child, where he was forced to rethink assumptions about how the laptops would be used, the founder said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Initially i worked on the keyboard display and then quickly realized the challenge was in the field and developed a framework for creating infrastructure,&#8221; Hassounah said.</span></p>
<p>The problem was the initial design of the system did not take into account lack of access to power for laptops at children&#8217;s homes. So the initiative developed a charging unit for swapping batteries. Children would use their laptops over the course of the day and take them home, and when they needed a fresh charge, they would swap out the batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are fleets that need this exact solution,&#8221; said de Souza. But there are advantages for individual car owners as well, he said. &#8220;T<span style="font-weight: 400;">he experience for the owner of a vehicle is after time the battery degrades. With ours as we put new batteries in the car can go further and further over time.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Right now, OEMs are sending cars without batteries and Ample is just installing their charging system, said Hassounah, but as the number of vehicles using the system rises above 1,000, the company expects to send their plates to manufacturers, who can then have Ample install their own packs.</p>
<p>Currently, Ample only supports level one and level two charging, but won&#8217;t offer fast charging options for the car makers it works with &#8212; likely because that option would cannibalize the company&#8217;s business and potentially obviate the need for its swapping technology.</p>
<p>At issue is the time it takes to charge a car. Fast chargers still take between 20 and 30 minutes to charge up, but advances in technologies should drive that figure down. Even if fast charging ultimately becomes a better option, Ample&#8217;s founders say they view their business as an additive step to faster electric vehicle adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re moving 1 billion cars, you need everything&#8230; We have so many cars we need to put on the road,&#8221; Hassounah said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We think we need all solutions to solve the problem. As you think of fleet applications you need a solution that can match gas in charge and not speed. Fast charging is not available in mass. The challenge will not be can the battery be charged in 5 minutes. The cost of building  charges that can deliver that amount of power is prohibitive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Looking beyond charging, Ample sees opportunities in the grid power market as well, the two founders said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Time shift is built into our economics… that’s another way we can help,&#8221; said de Souza. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use that as grid storage… we can do demand charge and now that the federal mandate is there to feed into the grid we can help stabilize the grid by feeding back energy.. We don’t have a lot of stations to make a significant impact. As we scale up this year we will.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>Currently the company is operating at a storage capacity of tens of megawatts per hour, according to Hassounah.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We can use the side storage to accelerate the development of swapping stations,&#8221; de Souza said. &#8220;You don’t have to invest an insane amount of money to put them in. We can finance the batteries in multiple ways as well as utilize other sources of financing.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sub-category of soft robotics has transformed the way many think about the field. Oft-influenced by natural phenomenon, the technology offers a dramatically different approach than the sort of rigid structures we traditionally think of when we discuss robots.</p>
<p>Soft designs offer a number of benefits, including compliance, which has already seen a number of real-world applications in manufacturing and fulfillment. But like their more rigid cousins, soft robots have their limitations. As such, designers generally choose between one or the other for a given job &#8212; or, best-case scenario, design swappable parts.</p>

<p>A team at MIT’s CSAIL lab <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/helping-soft-robots-turn-rigid-demand">is exploring a technology</a> that could make choosing less of a trade-off. The project has been in the works since 2017, though it’s still in the somewhat early stages &#8212; still largely the realm of computer simulation, though the details have been outlined in a new paper.</p>
<p>“This is the first step in trying to see if we can get the best of both worlds,” CSAIL post-doc James Bern said in a release.</p>
<p>In the project (or the simulated version, at least), the robot is controlled by a series of cables. Pulling on them in the right combination turns the soft structure into a hard one. The team uses the analogy of a series of muscles controlling the human arm &#8212; if the right ones are flexed, you can effectively lock a position in place.</p>
<p>The team will present their findings at a conference next month. For the time being, they’re currently working on a prototype to showcase how it operates in a real-world setting. Combining the two fields could go a ways toward building safer collaborative robots for interacting with human workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla, Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors &#8212; potential rivals in the burgeoning EV market &#8212; are working together to pass laws that would allow direct sales in at least eight states with another batch of proposed legislation likely being introduced this year.</p>
<p>Passage of such legislation would clear the way for EV giants like Tesla, along with newcomers Lucid and Rivian, which have yet to bring a vehicle to market, to sell directly to consumers. However, Tesla&#8217;s cooperation could also cost the company its monopoly on direct sales in some states.</p>
<p>Tesla and a growing number of new EV companies have a different business model than legacy automakers like GM, Ford and Stellantis. Tesla sells vehicles through their own branded stores &#8212; similar to how Apple sells its products &#8212; and do not have franchised dealerships. The direct sales model has attracted the ire of auto dealers, who benefit from long-established rules in all 50 states that prevent manufacturers<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with existing franchisees from opening their own dealerships to compete with them. Tesla and other allies argue that because they don&#8217;t have franchise dealers, they should be allowed to sell directly to consumers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We support our other EV-only manufacturers and their desires to sell direct-to-consumers, to invest, to create jobs and to do that unfettered as we are allowed,&#8221; Thad Kurowski, senior policy manager at Tesla, said while testifying in the state of Washington during the House&#8217;s Consumer Protection and Business Committee. Washington is one of many states where such legislation is being considered. Tesla has six retail locations in the state.</p>
<p>Similar legislation is being considered in Connecticut, Nebraska, Georgia, New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada. Some of these states ban all EV manufacturers from directly selling to customers; some only permit Tesla, at the exclusion of other companies, but cap the number of retail stores it can open.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare moment of cooperation for EV manufacturers, companies that must contend not only with each other but with legacy automakers for market share. Relations between the companies have not always been so copacetic: Tesla last July <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/">filed a lawsuit against Rivian</a> alleging theft of trade secrets and talent poaching. Rivian responded that two of the three claims in the case were nothing more than an attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/rivian-fires-back-at-tesla-in-lawsuit/">smear its reputation</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla is a veteran of battles with state legislatures over direct sales. At least a dozen states, including Arizona, Colorado and Utah have reversed bans that prevented Tesla from selling directly to consumers either through new legislation or via the courts.</p>
<p>Michigan, home to major automakers GM and Ford, has been a longtime battleground.</p>
<p>Former Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill in 2014 that was initiated and backed by the Michigan Automobile Dealers Association, banning Tesla from selling directly to consumers in the state. Two years later, Tesla sued the state of Michigan when it denied Tesla a dealership license. The Michigan Legislature last December considered a bill that would have banned all direct sales except for Tesla, an arrangement that allowed the automaker to deliver cars to customers, so long as the vehicle sale and title transfer didn&#8217;t occur in the state. That special exception for Tesla was removed from the proposed legislation, a move that would have threatened what little progress it had in the state. At the end, though, the legislation died, leaving Tesla&#8217;s arrangement intact.</p>
<p>Lucid is leading the charge in some states where direct sales legislation is being considered, according to Daniel Witt, who worked at Tesla before joining the new EV entrant as a public policy lead. Witt emphasized the bills are the result of efforts from the coalition of EV companies, grassroots lobbying from EV owners and EV enthusiasts and consumer groups. The legislation has also found support from environmental and clean energy groups, which argue that consumer choice and ease of access are key to helping people transition away from internal combustion engine cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any situation where the door got closed behind Tesla was not a matter of trying to gain a market advantage so much as it was just a product of the negotiations in a given legislature,&#8221; Witt said. &#8220;By and large, whether it&#8217;s New York, or Washington or Connecticut, we&#8217;re all rowing in the same direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, the Washington State Auto Dealers Association said franchised dealers support the transition toward zero-emission vehicles and want to sell them at their locations. But it said the direct sale bill is a &#8220;battle of Main Street vs. Wall Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Electric vehicle manufacturers perpetuate [the] myth of the middleman when the reality is that they would bear the same costs if they built their own stores, but would ship their revenue to their billionaire investors out of state after the sale is made instead of reinvesting in the community,&#8221; the group said.</p>
<p>The organization pointed out that Rivian has garnered $500 million in funding from Ford.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would stop Ford from abandoning its dealer network, and shifting the profits dealers generate for the company out of Ford and into greater ownership of Rivian? Or GM from spinning off an EV subsidiary?&#8221; the group said in its statement.</p>
<p>EV manufacturers have a long legislative road ahead of them. Bills generally must clear legislative committees and receive majority votes from both the House and Senate before being sent to the governor&#8217;s desk to be signed into law.</p>

You can also push the &#8220;Play&#8221; button to start watching the program immediately.</p>
<p>At launch, the feature will include short clips from Netflix&#8217;s comedy catalog, including films like &#8220;Murder Mystery,&#8221; series like &#8220;Big Mouth,&#8221; sitcoms like &#8220;The Crew,&#8221; as well as snippets from stand-up comedians like Kevin Hart and Ali Wong.</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch the feature will tap into its full catalog, not just its own original programs. However, the company couldn&#8217;t says how many total shows or movies would be featured in the new experience at any given time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The feature, notably, has been given prominent placement in the Netflix app, where it&#8217;s accessible from the bottom navigation menu on its own tab, next to &#8220;Coming Soon.&#8221; This is no small experiment, then &#8212; but rather an indication of how successful the early tests of the &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature must have been in terms of engaging users and connecting them to Netflix content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; is not the first time Netflix has borrowed concepts from social media to help users discover new shows or movies to watch in its app. A few years ago, Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17255966/netflix-30-second-video-previews-mobile">introduced</a> its own short-form video &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature, called Previews, for example. But times have changed. Now users are drawn to short-form vertical video feeds, like those popularized by TikTok.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120438" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120438" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120438" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; heavily borrows from the TikTok format, as its feed also features full-screen videos that you can swipe through vertically, and places the engagement buttons on the right side of the screen. These buttons let you react to the clip with an &#8220;LOL&#8221; (crying/laughing) emoji or share it via iMessage or other social media apps, like WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter. You can also start watching the show immediately or save it for later viewing by adding it to &#8220;My List.&#8221;</p>
<p>During tests, &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; clips ranged in length anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds. Today, Netflix says there&#8217;s no exact clip length for these video snippets.</p>
<p>Because the clips&#8217; content may not be appropriate for children, the &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; tab won&#8217;t appear on Netflix kids&#8217; profiles. In addition, members will be able to filter the content based on their own settings for maturity rating levels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120393" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120393" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The company is positioning the feature as a discovery tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to give members a fun, fast, and intuitive way to discover our catalog by letting these comedic moments across genres speak for themselves in a mobile-native, full screen experience,&#8221; said Netflix Product Designer <a href="https://www.kimho.design/fastlaughs">Kim Ho</a>, who previously worked on product design at Facebook, Instacart, and Coin. &#8220;We worked hard to cut to just what was necessary in an intentional and minimalist UI design, from the transparent tab bar to ways to react in the moment (&#8216;LOL&#8217;) and plan their next laugh by adding to their list,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>But though &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; is focused on finding new things to watch, the feature could, in fact, help Netflix compete with TikTok in terms of time spent on mobile devices, as it caters to the growing demand for shorter, more &#8220;snackable&#8221; video content.</p>
<p>Netflix says the feature is rolling out now to iOS and will begin testing on Android in the months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced educational institutions to go virtual, many were scrambling to develop online or blended curriculums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That struggle was particularly challenging for trade schools, many of which were not designed to teach online and were mostly paper-driven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coursekey.com">CourseKey</a>, a San Diego-based trade school management SaaS startup, was in a unique position. Demand surged and its ARR grew by 200% in 2020. And now, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company has raised $9 million in a Series B led by SignalFire and with participation from existing backer Builders VC to help it continue its momentum. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015 by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Luke Sophinos and Fadee Kannah, CourseKey’s B2B platform is designed to work with organizations that teach some of our most essential workers &#8212; from automotive mechanics to electricians to plumbers to nurses, phlebotomists and dental assistants.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120371" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg" alt="CourseKey founders Luke Sophinos (left) and Faddee Kannah (right)" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/luke-sophinos-faddee-kannah.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120371" class="wp-caption-text">CourseKey founders Luke Sophinos (left) and Fadee Kannah (right)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to help those organizations boost revenue by improving</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> student retention and graduation rates, helping them maintain regulatory compliance and generally streamline processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things really took off last year when the coronavirus hit,” Sophinos said. “So many schools had to adopt a digital arsenal. We saw a massive acceleration trend that was already going to happen. Every industry had been eaten. We just found a space that wasn&#8217;t yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CourseKey currently works with over 200 career colleges, including the Paul Mitchell School and the Institute for Business &amp; Technology, among others. Over 100,000 students use its software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sophinos and Kannah, founding CourseKey was more than just a business opportunity. Kannah, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who had fled Iraq as a refugee, saw family members going through trade schools that were lacking technology infrastructure and modern software tools. He architected the CourseKey platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophinos, frustrated by his own college experience, applied for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thiel Fellowship &#8211; a program that supports students in company building instead of university attending. However, he recognized that not everyone who doesn’t want to go to traditional college has that option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While looking at alternatives, our early team began recognizing a market that we felt no one was paying attention to. It was occupied by our friends and by our family members,” Sophinos said. “It was a space that, for some odd reason, was largely being left out of the education conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the founding team (Sophinos, Kannah, Ryan Vanshur, Marc Barron, Michael Woo, Fadi George and Luan Nguyen) partnered with a large vocational education provider to build and launch what Sophinos describes as “the world’s first trade school management system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focused on automating daily classroom procedures like attendance and grading, enhancing the student experience through communication tools, helping to identify at-risk students, and simplifying compliance,” he said. “We also visualized data for retention purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CourseKey also does things like track skill attainment, run evaluations and exams and integrate third-party tools.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120365" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120365" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg 4001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Highlight-PR.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120365" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CourseKey</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s goal with its new capital is to scale the platform to serve “every trade school in the country” with the mission of changing the narrative that four-year college is the &#8220;only option.&#8221; It also plans to add new features and capabilities, largely based on customer requests. CourseKey also plans to nearly double its current headcount of just over 50 employees to nearly 100 over the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a massive market and massive business opportunity,” Sophinos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CourseKey has an impressive list of supporters beyond SignalFire and Builders. Steve Altman, former vice chairman and president of Qualcomm, led its $3.5 million seed round which also included participation from Larry Rosenberger, former FICO CEO. Dennis Yang, former CEO of edtech giant Udemy, and Altman now serve on its board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SignalFire Managing Director Wayne Hu, who also took a seat on the startup’s board with the new round, said his firm recognized that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vocational schools and their administrators, instructors, and students “suffer from a lack of purpose-built software.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems are optimized for traditional K-12 schools and university workflow, but vocational schools are stuck relying on pen and paper or trying to shoe-horn in solutions that aren&#8217;t built for them,” Hu wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CourseKey, in SignalFire’s view, is reimagining a new education operating system built specifically for experiential, hands-on learning models, which continues to evolve with hybrid/distance learning.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hu also pointed out that since many of the jobs that vocational schools are preparing people for “have life or death consequences,&#8221; they are highly regulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only does CourseKey improve trade school business KPIs, it serves as insurance against this existential risk,” he added.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Could a bet on AppLovin then be viewed as a wager not on its business income growth, but on the strength of consumer app demand?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AppLovin released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1751008/000119312521065782/d73804ds1.htm">its S-1 filing</a> yesterday, bringing the Palo Alto-based mobile-app-focused software company a step closer to joining the public markets.</p>
<p>The business results detailed in the document are generally impressive. While some companies going public in recent months have detailed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">pandemic-fueled growth to lean against </a>or membership in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/digitaloceans-ipo-filing-shows-a-two-class-cloud-market/">a sector hotter than individual results</a>, AppLovin&#8217;s filing tells the story of a rapidly growing company that has managed to scale adjusted profit as it has grown.</p>
<p>And now, with annual revenue north of $1 billion, AppLovin is also a very large company, meaning that its IPO will be widely watched.</p>

<h2>Most of the news is good</h2>
<p>As a short introduction, the company&#8217;s products are designed to help developers find users and monetize their apps. AppLovin has its own in-house suite of mobile apps, what its S-1 calls a &#8220;globally diversified portfolio of over 200 free-to-play mobile games run by 12 studios.&#8221; Those apps have 32 million global daily actives, the document added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty neat company to dig into if you&#8217;re into mobile apps at all. Regardless, what we care about today are its numbers. So let&#8217;s talk <strong>growth</strong>, <strong>revenue quality</strong>, <strong>profits</strong>, <strong>cash consumption</strong> and <strong>capital structure</strong>. Most of the news is good, even if there are some downsides to AppLovin&#8217;s capital structure.</p>
<p>Recall that KKR <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-applovin-m-a-kkr/kkr-agrees-to-buy-stake-in-applovin-at-2-billion-valuation-idUSKBN1K62W5">bought a chunk of AppLovin</a> back in mid-2018 at a valuation of around $2 billion. That number appears comically low, given that the company posted $483.4 million in revenue that year, a figure that it roughly doubled in 2019 to $994.1 million. Growth slowed in percentage terms in 2020, when AppLovin saw total revenues of $1.45 billion, though the company managed similar growth in gross-dollar terms.</p>
<p>In percentage terms, AppLovin grew 106% from 2018 to 2019, and 46% from 2019 to 2020. How KKR got to buy into the company at 4x revenues when it was growing at 100% is not clear.</p>
<p>The company is growing well, but is AppLovin accreting revenue of high quality? Yes, but we need to scrape some grime off the numbers to understand them. Turning to the company&#8217;s yearly results, AppLovin&#8217;s cost of revenue rose steadily as a percentage of revenue from 2018 to 2020. Indeed, the numbers went from 11% in 2018 to 24% in 2019 and 38% in 2020. That&#8217;s an awful progression, and if we lacked more information we&#8217;d posit that the company&#8217;s overall revenue quality was sharply declining.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that bad. There&#8217;s about $1 million in share-based compensation inside the 2020 cost of revenue figure and $228.3 million of &#8220;amortization expense related to acquired intangibles.&#8221; If we yank out those from the cost-of-revenue line item, AppLovin&#8217;s gross margin for 2020 grows from 62% to 77.5%. That&#8217;s much better.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new project from Microsoft&#8217;s in-house incubator, Microsoft Garage, introduces a different take on meeting transcriptions. While today there are a number of real-time transcription apps to use on your phone &#8212; like <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> or Google&#8217;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Recorder</a> app for Pixel devices, for example &#8212; Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885">new Group Transcribe app</a> reimagines meeting transcriptions as a more collaborative process, where everyone simultaneously records the meeting on their own device for higher accuracy. It also offers real-time translation for languages spoken in over 80 distinct locales.</p>
<p>To use the app, one person would first initiate the meeting in their own device. They can then invite the other meeting attendees to join the session via Bluetooth, a scannable QR code or by sharing a link. After the other participants join the session and the meeting begins, each person will see the transcript appear in real-time on their own device.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120346" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120346" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120346" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120346" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app, which is powered by A.I. speech and language technology, is able to transcribe with higher accuracy and speaker attribution based on the volume of the speaker captured by the microphone of each phone being used in the meeting.</p>
<p>By comparing the level of a person&#8217;s voice volume, the cloud service attempts to determine which device is closest to the speaker and the language preferences of that speaker. This means speakers are also accurately labeled in the app, which can be a challenge for other transcription apps where only one person is recording.</p>
<p>In addition, if meeting participants want to speak in their own language, the app can provide the translation to others&#8217; devices in their own language.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120347" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120347" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120347" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft says the app is designed with accessibility in mind, as it makes it easier for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, and non-native speakers to more fully participate in meetings by following along through the live transcriptions and translations.</p>
<p>The project itself was built by Microsoft employees who collectively speak over a dozen different languages and dialects.</p>
<p>&#8220;This can be a fantastic tool for communication. What I would love to see is for this to break down barriers for people speaking across multiple languages,” said Franklin Munoz, Principal Development Lead, when <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2021/03/new-garage-project-group-transcribe-helps-you-transcribe-and-translate-while-advancing-inclusive-speech-ai/">introducing</a> the project.</p>
<p>Like most cloud-based transcription services, the app should not be used for highly confidential meetings. However, Microsoft has built granular data and privacy controls that allow users to decide if or when they want to share their conversation data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120349" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120349" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120349" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>To work, the audio and text input data collected is sent to Microsoft&#8217;s online speech recognitions and translation technologies &#8212; though with a randomly generated identifier, not your real name.</p>
<p>While Microsoft doesn&#8217;t save the meeting transcripts and recordings itself after the fact &#8212; they&#8217;re saved on your device &#8212; the app does encourage participants to &#8220;contribute&#8221; their meetings recordings to Microsoft so it can improve the service.</p>
<p>This allows Microsoft to retain the audio and speech recognition-generated text transcriptions when all meeting participants agree to opt in for that session. By reviewing the data, Microsoft aims to improve its speech recognition and speaker attribution capabilities over time, it says. The user data will then be accessed under NDA by both Microsoft employees and contractors from other companies who work for Microsoft, but won&#8217;t include any of the speakers&#8217; account credentials.</p>
<p>Reviewers will also only have access to randomized snippets of audio, not full recordings. And Microsoft says it &#8220;de-identifies&#8221; meeting recordings by removing long strings of numbers that could represent things like credit card numbers or phone numbers, for example. Users can delete their previously shared recordings at any time, but otherwise they&#8217;re retained for up to 2 years on encrypted servers, the company says.</p>
<p>Because there&#8217;s not a way for a business, at an admin level, to configure or block the &#8220;contribution&#8221; setting for all users, people should carefully weigh the advantages and risks of such a service. It&#8217;s also a Microsoft Garage project, meaning it&#8217;s meant to be more experimental and could be shuttered at any time.</p>
<p>Currently, the Group Transcribe app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885">available on iOS only</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://clari.com">Clari</a>, the revenue operations platform that helps companies predict revenue outcomes, announced $150 million Series E today on a $1.6 billion valuation, a number that more than triples its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/clari-snags-60m-series-d-on-valuation-of-around-500m/">2019 Series D valuation</a> of $500 million.</p>
<p>Silver Lake led the latest investment with participation from B Capital Group and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Madrona Ventures, Thomvest and Tenaya Capital. The company reports it has now raised a total of $285 million.</p>
<p>While COVID made 2020 trying for everyone, a company with a product that allows executive teams to understand and predict revenue at a granular level was obviously going to be in demand, and Clari saw a lot of interest over the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It was a surreal year for us, given the momentum we had and all of the tough news we saw going on around us. For us, the usage metrics were just off the charts, as people need visibility and predictability and control over their revenue forecasts,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Andy Byrne told me.</p>
<p>While Byrne didn&#8217;t want to discuss revenue specifics, he did point out that he beat the revenue plan he submitted to his board by 110%. He said the performance has led to a lot of inbound investor interest in the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve had such great investor interest is that [VCs] were hearing in the investment community about how transformative Clari has been [&#8230;] just giving companies what we call revenue confidence, being able to go and understand where you&#8217;re going to be and to accurately predict the impact the pandemic is going to have on your trajectory, good or bad,&#8221; Byrne explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ibf93PshvR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/">Gong raises another $200M on $2.2B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong raises another $200M on $2.2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=Ibf93PshvR" data-secret="Ibf93PshvR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To this point, the company has been working with sales and marketing teams, but Byrne says that the company is expanding the scope of the product to bring that same predictability to other parts of an organization.</p>
<p>Clari has mostly focused on technology companies with customers like HPE, Workday and Adobe, but it has plans to expand beyond that vertical. In fact, one of the ways Byrne plans to put today&#8217;s investment to work is to push into other verticals, which could also benefit from this kind of revenue visibility.</p>
<p>The company is up 300 employees with plans to double that number by the end of 2021. Byrne says he is building a positive work culture and points to recently being recognized as one of the best places to work by Inc., Bay Area News Group, #GirlsClub and Built In. He says they have made progress when it comes to diversity hirings across a number dimensions, but admits there is still work to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually specifically [established] a commission around diversity and inclusion that has board level [backing] that we&#8217;re running to continue to do better work there. Having said that, we still recognize that we&#8217;re not too dissimilar to a lot of companies where we feel like there&#8217;s so much more that we need to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At this point in the company&#8217;s evolution with plenty of money in the bank and a healthy valuation, Byrne did not shy away from the IPO question, although as you would imagine, he wasn&#8217;t ready to discuss specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say the answer is unequivocally yes, and we&#8217;re building toward this. [&#8230;] We don&#8217;t have a timeframe upon which we know where we&#8217;re going to go public, but the next goal is to get to the IPO starting line,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today’s the day we roll up our collective sleeves, engage in vital conversations about diversity, inclusion and equity in tech — and continue the important work of building a better industry for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">an impressive agenda</a> packed with interactive presentations, breakout sessions and panel discussions with some of the tech world’s brightest innovators, leaders and worker-activists. These folks are in the trenches, changing the world and creating exciting business opportunities. That’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Last-minute decision maker? No problem. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Join the conversation here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You’ll also have time to network and connect with attendees around the world, enjoy startup presentations and even meet some of the early-stage companies in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/include/">TC Include</a> founder cohort.</p>
<p>We’re got an incredibly deep bench of talented experts and visionaries ready to take the virtual stage. Here are just a few of the panels and people you simply don’t want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn:</strong> Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias:</strong> Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People’s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma, and author of Algorithms of Oppression Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p><strong>Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>
<p><strong>Why Social Media is Broken and What To Do About It: </strong>Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse. Naj Austin (Somewhere Good &amp; Ethel&#8217;s Club), Jesse Lehrich (Accountable Tech) and Rashad Robinson (Color of Change)</p>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds:</strong> Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change. Sandra Altine (Facebook), Wade Davis (Netflix) and Bo Young Lee (Uber)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> kicks off today. Join your colleagues, learn, connect, and discover new ways and opportunities to build stronger startups and a more just tech industry for all people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.presight.vc">Presight Capital</a> has closed its $350 million second fund only a year and a half after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/presight-capital/">announced an $80 million first fund</a>. In fact, General Partner Christian Angermayer told me that the fund was raised in just a few weeks, and that it shot past the initial goal of $250 million.</p>
<p>Presight is the international venture arm of Angermayer&#8217;s family office <a href="https://www.apeiron-investments.com">Apeiron Investment Group</a>, which has more than $2.5 billion under management. When I spoke to him about Presight&#8217;s first fund, he emphasized the firm&#8217;s ability to help U.S. startups expand into Europe, particularly with navigating the regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Angermayer told me the strategy remains the same for the second fund, and he pointed to a couple other key elements to the Presight approach. For one thing, there&#8217;s the firm&#8217;s co-investing approach: &#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;re co-leading [the round], but there&#8217;s always a partner we work with.&#8221; And although Presight has a relatively small investment team — besides Angermayer, there&#8217;s General Partner Fabian Hansen and Principal Philipp Schreiber — portfolio companies also have access to the larger Apeiron team (20 full-time employees) and network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hansen said Presight remains sector agnostic in its investments, with a particular interest in biotech and deeptech. It&#8217;s already had some big successes in these fields, with <a href="https://www.abcellera.com/news/2020-05-27-abcellera-closes-series-b-financing">an early investment</a> in AI-powered drug discovery platform AbCellera <a href="https://www.archyde.com/ai-biotech-provider-abcellera-goes-public-with-enormous-success/">leading to an IPO</a> and Compass Pathways (a company that has patented a synthetic version of psilocybin to treat depression) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-18/-magic-mushroom-company-moves-toward-mainstream-in-nasdaq-ipo">also going public</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2120336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?w=680" alt="Fabian Hansen" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120336" class="wp-caption-text">Fabian Hansen</p></div></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-cant-put-price-tag-life-except-we-can-christian-angermayer/">a LinkedIn post</a> published last fall, Angermayer argued that biotech will be the biggest sector over the next 10 to 20 years, and that the key metric in this field is quality-adjusted life years — the idea being that a year of life at perfect health is worth 1 QALY, death is zero, while life without perfect health is somewhere in between (or could even have a value below zero).</p>
<p>&#8220;And here’s the real conclusion: The big winners – besides everyone benefitting from these advances – will be the companies who are PRODUCING QALYs: biotech companies,&#8221; Angermayer wrote. And he is open about the fact that he has a personal motive in this: &#8220;Put simply, I want to live forever! And in perfect health! And it is my sincere belief that we will achieve the means to do this within the next 20-30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hansen added that there&#8217;s a &#8220;whole generation&#8221; of executives at biotech firms who are launching new startups as they realize, &#8220;I can start my own company, it&#8217;s not that expensive to try out new things, I can raise a venture round.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a source with knowledge of the firm, limited partners in Presight Fund Two include AbCellera founder and CEO Carl Hansen, former Goldman Sachs CFO Martin Chavez, Uma Thurman, Founders Forum co-founder Brent Hoberman, Point72 and the family offices of XING founder Lars Hinrich, Nicole Junkermann, Louis Bacon, Alan Howard, German real estate tycoon Albert Buell and Mike Novogratz. Plus, Angermayer himself invested $60 million.</p>
