										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.founderscircle.com/">Founders Circle Capital</a>, a nine-year-old, San Francisco-based investment firm that strikes agreements with private, venture-backed companies to buy some of the vested stock options of their founders and employees &#8212; so they can buy a house or just breathe a bit more easily &#8212;  has closed its newest fund with $355 million in capital commitments, bringing the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the outfit, which has more competition than ever &#8212; both by other <a href="https://www.industryventures.com/recent_news/industry-ventures-raises-oversubscribed-850-million-secondary-fund/">secondary investment firms</a>, aggressive outfits like Tiger Global that routinely <a href="https://entrackr.com/2020/03/tiger-global-invests-in-chinese-tech-giant-bytedance/">acquire secondary stakes</a> in companies,  as well as special purpose acquisition companies that are taking companies public a lot faster and alleviating the need of early shareholders to cash out via private sales &#8212; is also introducing a new twist to its business.</p>
<p>Specifically, according to both cofounder and CEO Ken Loveless and the outfit&#8217;s chief people officer, Mark Dempster, Founders Circle is now offering startups so-called flexible capital, too. We talked with Loveless and Dempster via Zoom late last week about the new fund and generally what they are seeing out there. Excerpts from that chat, edited for length and clarity, follow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: This is your third fund. How does it compare with your earlier funds?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We&#8217;ve raised three main funds. This is our third, but we&#8217;ve raised something like 17 entities [altogether], including some co-investment vehicles and special purpose vehicles to invest in some of our companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And you&#8217;re now changing your approach a bit. How so?</strong></p>
<p>MD: [We&#8217;re now offering] a mix of primary and secondary [investment dollars] and we can [offer these] are any time and in any combination. These [investments] don&#8217;t have to happen during a certain [distinct] round of financing; we might get involved in eight to 10 different investments [tied to the company].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have a debt partner so you have more capital at your disposal if you need it?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We have a strategic partnership with Silicon Valley Bank, so they are typically the lender to these individuals as they solve their liquidity. In many cases, we provide an equity backstop to that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How has your world changed now that people perhaps see a light at the end of the tunnel, with companies becoming publicly traded entities in a variety of ways that we weren&#8217;t seeing in recent years? Are employees or founders any more or less reluctant to share their shares in secondary transactions?</strong></p>
<p>KL: There hasn&#8217;t been any significant change. We had a portfolio company go public in UiPath that was 16 years old and if you think about how many things change in your life over that kind of time period, it would be quite a long list. We also had [stakes] in DoorDash and Poshmark, and if you look at the time between when they were founded and became publicly traded, it was close to a decade for both. So [while there is some market receptivity for companies] that really are two years old or three years old, the average [time from launch to publicly traded company] is still 10-plus years on average.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of outfits are competing for the same shares that you want to buy, including Tiger Global, which is paying very high prices in many cases. In addition to competing with these companies, I&#8217;m wondering if you ever sell your shares to them.</strong></p>
<p>KL: We are typically a long-only investor. We have not sold any secondary shares. We typically hold through a public offering. We&#8217;re really trying to focus on those companies that can truly be in enduring, decades-old businesses. We obviously wouldn&#8217;t hold that long, but we&#8217;re holding into the public markets.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long do you hold your shares?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We&#8217;re not bound [by anything] but what we tell our [investors] is that we typically hold for an average of one year post public offering [then distribute the shares to them].</p>
<p><strong>TC: How, if at all, are you playing this SPAC phenomenon? Are you seeing opportunities to jump into these blank check companies before they merge with brands you&#8217;ve maybe been tracking?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We have not directly participated in a SPAC, but we have had some of our portfolio companies merged with some SPACs to become what we hope will be enduring public businesses. So we&#8217;ve taken advantage of [those exits] as a financing tool.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been at this for roughly a decade. How many companies have you backed and how many of these have exited?</strong></p>
<p>MD: We&#8217;ve invested in 73 companies and 31 have exited.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know you tend to invest at a later stage &#8212; have there been any shutdowns owing to unforeseen circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>MD: We&#8217;ve had zero company shutdowns.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And what about what you&#8217;re having to pay? How has that changed over the last year or so?</strong></p>
<p>KL: We just did an analysis of this and if you adjust for growth, we have not seen a substantial raise in valuations that we have paid compared to where prices were pre pandemic. We&#8217;re paying the same dollar for a point of growth as we were before [COVID-19 struck the U.S.].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>KL: Companies that have solid unit economics have become better at both benchmarking their internal metrics, and investors have become better at understanding those and metrics. The consistency and underwriting by investors is becoming better and better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche has always gone its own way when it comes to creating new vehicles. It is, after all, the company that continues to stick to the wacky idea that putting the weight of an engine in the rear of a sports car is a great idea. (It is!)</p>
<p>So, bucking the crossover trend to create an all-electric, soft-roading wagon with just 20 more millimeters of clearance than their popular electric Taycan sedan isn&#8217;t out of character for the brand. Instead, it’s another example of how Porsche approaches electrification.&#8221;You don&#8217;t make an electric car. You make a Porsche with an electric powertrain,&#8221; Calvin Kim, product spokesperson for the Taycan line, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The 2021 Taycan Cross Turismo fits that bill. Powerful, quick, comfortable, luxurious and tech-laden, the Porsche Taycan 4 Cross Turismo (one of four variants of the wagon) offers a blend of practicality with a whole lot of power and speed for under $100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Why build an electric Porsche wagon?</h2>
<p>Porsche upended the sports car enthusiast club when it launched the Cayenne nearly 20 years ago and is doing the same with the Taycan and the Taycan Cross Turismo. While the SUV and crossover business is still a tremendous cash cow for the company, nearly 4,500 Taycans were sold in 2020, according to a recent release from Porsche. That&#8217;s more than either the 718 or the Panamera line. Porsche also says that from cradle to manufacturing, the new Cross Turismo is carbon neutral — the first vehicle they&#8217;ve made that has achieved that status.</p>
<p>“Porsche wanted to create the most sporty capability we can make,” Kim said, “and a wagon version of the Taycan embodies that ethos.”</p>
<p>The 2021 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo is on sale today. Porsche says that it expects deliveries to start this summer.</p>

<h2>Taycan versus Taycan Cross Turismo</h2>
<p>Beyond the obvious form factor, prospective buyers or EV enthusiasts might wonder why someone might opt for a Cross Turismo over the original Taycan?</p>
<p>There are a few important differences between the two vehicles that might push some customers over to the wagon. First up, the Cross Turismo offers more passenger and cargo space. Passengers get an additional 0.35 inches of headroom up front and 3.69 inches in the back. The wagon is also equipped with more cargo space — 15.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats or 42.8 cubic feet with them folded forward. Like the Taycan, the Cross Turismo has an additional 2.9 cubic feet of area in the frunk.</p>
<p>The Cross Turismo also has a skosh 20 millimeters (just short of 1 inch) more ground clearance than the Taycan sedan and an additional driving mode called Gravel. Gravel mode is activated by a soft key on the center console rather than by the mode wheel on the steering wheel. It raises the car&#8217;s height and makes changes to the stability control and torque management system for better grip on gravel, snow or ice. Unfortunately, on our short test drive, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to put Gravel mode to the test.</p>

<p>On top of these features, the Taycan Cross Turismo comes with all-wheel drive and standard air suspension (called Porsche Active Suspension Management or PASM), which, on the Taycan, is a $2,200 option. The Taycan Cross Turismo comes standard with the larger 93.4 kWh battery pack, which is a $5,780 option on the base Taycan sedan. The Cross Turismo is built on the same platform as the Taycan sedan, known as J1, internally.</p>
<p>There are four different variants of the Taycan Cross Turismo, including the one I drove. You can choose from the entry-level Taycan 4 Cross Turismo, the Taycan 4S Cross Turismo, the Taycan Turbo Cross Turismo and the Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo. At the highest trims, base prices start at $188,000. Pricing for the Taycan 4 Cross Turismo that I drove starts at $92,250 (including delivery).</p>
<p>Each flavor of Cross Turismo comes with an optional off-road package that adds lower body cladding to prevent rock chips on gravel roads and raises the vehicle by 10 millimeters. Porsche doesn&#8217;t state the ground clearance for the Taycan or the Taycan Cross Turismo, but approach and departure angles increase from 12.1 and 15.2 degrees to 12.2 and 16.2 degrees in the electric wagon.  In true Porsche fashion, the company says that there are more than 21,000 option combinations based solely on which Cross Turismo you choose, wheel choice, exterior color and interior selection, not to mention details like badge deletion, stitching, technology options and seat types.</p>
<p>Charging speeds are the same between the Cross Turismo and the Taycan. Porsche says that on DC fast chargers, the Taycan Cross Turismo can recharge from 5% to 80% in just 22.5-minutes.</p>

<h2>First drive</h2>
<p>The Taycan Cross Turismo 4, which I drove, represents the entry point to the new all-electric wagon. While neither Porsche nor the EPA has released range estimates, the European-spec, ruby red machine had just over 250 miles of range at 99% charge when I hopped into it for a Monday afternoon jaunt from Glendale, California to Big Bear and back. That nearly 200-mile trip left me with 68 miles of range in the proverbial tank. While it may seem like that math is off, it’s not, thanks to regenerative braking that helps generate electricity and push some of it back into the battery.</p>
<p>The drive consisted of about 140 miles along the highway and some 60 miles on mountain roads. Thanks to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive setup that comes standard on all Cross Turismos, the electric wagon felt planted and secure on misty and slightly icy mountain roads and took corners without a modicum of body roll. With a 375 horsepower (469 with launch control) and maximum available 368 lb-ft of torque, passing a sluggish motorist (or three at once) was handled with ease.</p>
<p>The Cross Turismo gets five different driving modes: Range, Normal, Sport, Sport Plus and Individual. On the highway, I started in Normal mode and noticed how easy it was to push the vehicle beyond the stated speed limit. Using the toggle on the wheel, I switched to Range mode, which helps conserve battery by limiting speed to just 80 miles per hour. All of the modes except Range allow the driver to take the Cross Turismo to its full 136-mile-per-hour potential.</p>

<p>My test vehicle was a European model. This meant that certain tech features that come with the Cross Turismo, including Porsche’s advanced driving assistance system InnoDrive and the navigation features, couldn’t be activated since my test drive was in the United States. However, the regular adaptive cruise control did work and I used it extensively on the highway run from Glendale to the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>The Taycan Cross Turismo’s adaptive cruise adapted quickly to the numerous drivers who cut into my lane. The feature handled these tricky moments the same way I would have, only with a bit more finesse. When a car swerved unexpectedly into my lane, the Cross Turismo slowed without slamming the brakes or stuttering and simply drew the 5,029-pound vehicle down to a slower speed and a comfortable following distance that was neither too short nor too long. As traffic sped up, the system would maintain the following distance without jostling or awkward pauses.</p>
<p>When I reached the base of the mountain, I had around 200 miles of range left. I toggled the Cross Turismo into Sport Plus mode and began the climb. In Sport and Sport Plus, the &#8220;engine noise&#8221; (for lack of a better term) inside the cabin becomes more audible. Porsche says that to create the sound, they recorded the motors&#8217; audio, adjusted it and then piped the sound into the cabin. Outside the cabin in both modes, the vehicle becomes a bit louder but not nearly as raucous as a combustion Porsche.</p>
<p>The roads leading to Big Bear are more winter-worn than those in the Los Angeles Basin and have plenty of cracks and potholes after a wet season. On the day I drove the route, it was misty and around 40 degrees, with frost licking the tips of the pines at higher elevations giving them a silver hue. The road was wet and wound through dense patches of cloud and fog, causing a few small icy spots on the roadway. The Cross Turismo took all of those challenges in stride.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever hustled a heavy and relatively large vehicle up a technical and twisting road, you know the body roll battle all too well. It&#8217;s a non-issue in the Cross Turismo. Because the body weight (battery and motors) are set low into the floor, the Cross Turismo feels as planted, comfortable and capable as a 911. The steering is direct and communicative without being twitchy. On the climb, I managed to trim off roughly 10 minutes on my estimated arrival without breaking a sweat or really pushing the car anywhere near the limit. At the predetermined coffee stop, I&#8217;d worn the battery down to 118 miles &#8212; plenty to get me back to Glendale with room to spare.</p>
<p>I ran the mountain road in Sport and cruised back to the valley. At the bottom of the mountain road, I noted that the vehicle had gained a few miles back thanks to regenerative braking and had 124 miles remaining. Throwing range anxiety to the wind and vowing to keep my eyes up for potential speed traps, I kept the Taycan Cross Turismo in Sport mode and zipped my way through 3 p.m. traffic, arriving back at the studio with plenty of power to spare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rather than a CEO-slamming sound bite free-for-all,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/senate-judiciary-tech-hearing-algorithms-twitter-youtube-facebook/"> Tuesday&#8217;s big tech hearing on algorithms</a> aimed for more of a listening session vibe — and in that sense it mostly succeeded.</p>
<p>The hearing centered on testimony from the policy leads at Facebook, YouTube and Twitter rather than the chief executives of those companies for a change. The resulting few hours didn’t offer any massive revelations but was still probably more productive than squeezing some of the world’s most powerful men for their commitments to “get back to you on that.”</p>
<p>In the hearing, lawmakers bemoaned social media echo chambers and the ways that the algorithms pumping content through platforms are capable of completely reshaping human behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“&#8230; This advanced technology is harnessed into algorithms designed to attract our time and attention on social media, and the results can be harmful to our kids’ attention spans, to the quality of our public discourse, to our public health, and even to our democracy itself,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), chair of the Senate Judiciary&#8217;s subcommittee on privacy and tech, which held the hearing.</p>
<p>Coons struck a cooperative note, observing that algorithms drive innovation but that their dark side comes with considerable costs</p>
<p>None of this is new, of course. But Congress is crawling closer to solutions, one repetitive tech hearing at a time. The Tuesday hearing highlighted some zones of bipartisan agreement that could determine the chances of a tech reform bill passing the Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Democrats. Coons expressed optimism that a “broadly bipartisan solution” could be reached.</p>
<p>What would that look like? Probably changes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/section-230/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, which we’ve written about extensively over the years. That law protects social media companies from liability for user-created content and it’s been a major nexus of tech regulation talk, both in the newly Democratic Senate under Biden and the previous Republican-led Senate that took its cues from Trump.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144660" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144660" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?w=680" alt="Lauren Culbertson, head of U.S. public policy at Twitter" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232559814.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144660" class="wp-caption-text">Lauren Culbertson, head of U.S. public policy at Twitter Inc., speaks remotely during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 27, 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Al Drago/Bloomberg / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<h2>A broken business model</h2>
<p>In the hearing, lawmakers pointed to flaws inherent to how major social media companies make money as the heart of the problem. Rather than criticizing companies for specific failings, they mostly focused on the core business model from which social media’s many ills spring forth.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s very important for us to push back on the idea that really complicated, qualitative problems have easy quantitative solutions,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said. He argued that because social media companies make money by keeping users hooked to their products, any real solution would have to upend that business model altogether.</p>
<p>“The business model of these companies is addiction,&#8221; Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) echoed, calling social media an “attention treadmill” by design.</p>
<p>Ex-Googler and frequent tech critic Tristan Harris didn’t mince words about how tech companies talk around that central design tenet in his own testimony. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like listening to a hostage in a hostage video,&#8221; Harris said, likening the engagement-seeking business model to a gun just offstage.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Section 230</h2>
<p>One big way lawmakers propose to disrupt those deeply entrenched incentives? Adding algorithm-focused exceptions to the Section 230 protections that social media companies enjoy. A few bills floating around take that approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/10/kennedy-applauds-house-companion-to-don-t-push-my-buttons-act">One bill</a> introduced in 2020 from Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) would require platforms with 10 million or more users to obtain consent before serving users content based on their behavior or demographic data if they want to keep Section 230 protections. The idea is to revoke 230 immunity from platforms that boost engagement by “funneling information to users that polarizes their views” unless a user specifically opts in.</p>
<p>In another bill, the <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-eshoo-and-malinowski-reintroduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-accountable">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a>, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) propose suspending Section 230 protections and making companies liable “if their algorithms amplify misinformation that leads to offline violence.” That bill would amend Section 230 to reference existing civil rights laws.</p>
<p>Section 230’s defenders <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/two-different-proposals-amend-section-230-share-similar-goal-damage-online-users">argue</a> that any insufficiently targeted changes to the law could disrupt the modern internet as we know it, resulting in cascading negative impacts well beyond the intended scope of reform efforts. An outright repeal of the law is almost certainly off the table, but even small tweaks could completely realign internet businesses, for better or worse.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Hawley made a broader suggestion for companies that use algorithms to chase profits. &#8220;Why shouldn’t we just remove Section 230 protection from any platform that engages in behavioral advertising or algorithmic amplification?&#8221; he asked, adding that he wasn’t opposed to an outright repeal of the law.</p>

<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, connected the algorithmic concerns to anti-competitive behavior in the tech industry. “If you have a company that buys out everyone from under them … we’re never going to know if they could have developed the bells and whistles to help us with misinformation because there is no competition,” Klobuchar said.</p>
<p>Subcommittee members Klobuchar and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) have their own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">major Section 230 reform bill, the Safe Tech Act</a>, but that legislation is less concerned with algorithms than ads and paid content.</p>
<p>At least one more major bill looking at Section 230 through the lens of algorithms is still on the way. Prominent Big Tech critic House Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) is due to propose a Section 230 bill soon that could suspend liability protections for companies that rely on algorithms to boost engagement and line their pockets.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a very complicated algorithm that is designed to maximize engagement to drive up advertising prices to produce greater profits for the company,&#8221; <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">Cicilline told Axios last month</a>. &#8221; … That&#8217;s a set of business decisions for which, it might be quite easy to argue, that a company should be liable for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Alphabet, Microsoft and Pinterest reported their quarterly earnings results for the first three months of 2021. Microsoft and Pinterest have rapidly lost value after reporting their results, while Alphabet appreciated after its own earnings download.</p>
<p>Sparing you a deluge of numbers, here&#8217;s what TechCrunch is pondering from each report in as few words as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alphabet&#8217;s <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78">earnings</a> were strong across a number of fronts; investors cheered. </strong>YouTube revenue grew nearly 50% to $6 billion, search ads performed well, and even the infamously unprofitable &#8220;Other Bets&#8221; ground managed to post nearly $200 million in revenue. But the most notable result from the technology conglomerate was its cloud results. Google Cloud grew from $2.777 billion in revenue and an operating loss of $1.73 billion in the year-ago quarter to revenues of $4.047 billion and an operating loss of just $974 million. The Mountain View-based agglomeration of tech services is building not only a material revenue stream out of a non-ad-based product, but one that could generate material operating income in time. If trends hold.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-21-Q3/press-release-webcast">earnings</a> report was pretty good despite Wall Street disinterest. </strong>Microsoft grew 17% from its year-ago quarter while pushing its operating income up 31% to $17 billion; faster growing income compared to revenue is indicative of operating leverage. The company&#8217;s net income actually grew even more rapidly than its operating income, which is sharper than expected. Azure, the company&#8217;s Google Cloud and AWS competitor, grew 50% in the quarter, which met expectations <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q3-2021.html">per CNBC</a>. Microsoft remains incredibly rich, and its most future-looking products put up some pretty big numbers. Not bad!</li>
<li><b>Pinterest <a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Pinterest-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results/">posted</a> a monster quarter. Wall Street was not impressed.</b> Pinterest&#8217;s Q1 2021 revenue of $485.230 million was up 78% compared to the year-ago quarter, the company cut its net loss from $141.196 million to $21.674 million at the same time, and its non-GAAP net income rose from -$59.916 million to $78.527 million during the first three months of the year. The result of this wildly impressive quarter? Its shares are off more than 8%. One reason Pinterest may have dropped is that the company missed on monthly active users (478 million reported, 480.5 million <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3685627-pinterest-q1-2021-earnings-preview">expected</a>), and warned that it would see &#8220;sequential operating expense growth [ … ] accelerate in Q2.&#8221; But with the company anticipating 105% revenue growth in the current quarter and midteens MAU growth in the same period, it&#8217;s hard to be that mad at the company. Unless we&#8217;re missing something major here, Pinterest is being punished by investors who simply expected even more?</li>
</ul>
<p>And there you have it, a very quick catch up. I am not supposed to cover earnings much anymore, but while you can take the pig from the shit, it&#8217;s hard to get the pig to not blog about earnings!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exyn Technologies announced Tuesday that it has achieved what it considers the highest level of aerial autonomy reached within the industry. The key to the achievement is that Exyn drones are immune to GPS signal loss, meaning all spatial and mapping computations are done onboard, the company said.</p>
<p>Under Exyn&#8217;s definitions of autonomy, which are based on a similar standard applied to automotive, the company&#8217;s drones have achieved Level 4A autonomy. This means the drones are able to explore a designated 3D area without a remote operator in the backseat, according to Exyn.</p>
<p>Exyn’s achievement is a major step up from the previous level 3 of autonomy, in which a human is required to be present to potentially take over, something that has prevented drones from entering spaces without ranging signals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Level 3 aerial autonomy landscape is also defined by point-to-point navigation, in which an operator lays out a sequence of locations for a robot to visit, and the robot does its best to get there. <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/xwing-plans-short-regional-flights-for-its-autonomous-cargo-planes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/xwing-plans-short-regional-flights-for-its-autonomous-cargo-planes/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Autonomous aviation startup Xwing&#8217;s self-flying utility aircraft</a> will operate on this level by following specific flight paths. However, in real-life use cases, an operator might not have intimate knowledge of the operating environment, and the robot might not be able to access existing maps to learn from and inform its movements.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We developed an autonomous system that can take you into dark, dirty, dangerous environments,” Exyn’s CTO Jason Derenick told TechCrunch. “Place it at the edge of danger and send it off to collect the information that you need. Oftentimes the information you need is beyond the line of sight, both in terms of communications as well as visual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exyn&#8217;s drones are given a capability the company calls &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwH9m5rPJlc&amp;ab_channel=ExynTechnologies">scoutaunomy</a>,&#8221; which involves defining a “bounding box volume” around which the drone can fly. Using lidar sensors, the drone can identify volume between explored and unexplored spaces in order to self-navigate and create an accurate, high-resolution map of the space. The drones, which are hardware-agnostic, can also carry additional sensors that collect further information to be integrated onto the maps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of building a three-dimensional map and then draping on top of it RGB information from the camera, so now you&#8217;ve got a photorealistic 3D representation of the space,” Nader Elm, CEO of Exyn Technologies, told TechCrunch. “If we&#8217;re carrying heat and humidity sensors, getting radiological reading, getting gas readings, checking the ventilation, et cetera. That’s going to be a very rich dataset that currently underground mining doesn’t have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Exyn Technologies’ use cases are in the mining industry, with clients like Rupert Resources and Dundee Precious Metals, where the ability to chart the unknown can keep miners safe and inform better business decisions. The company recently announced a partnership with Swedish mining and construction giant Sandvik that will involve integrating Exyn’s mapping software with Sandvik’s mapping analytics capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exyn is also working with government customers for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well as in nuclear energy, construction and logistics, according to the company. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be clear: The venture capital industry has lacked diversity. The good news is the industry is working to improve itself.</p>
<p>To begin with, as an industry, venture capital can only improve what we measure. In 2016, we set out to develop a rigorous methodology for tracking progress on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in venture capital, and to measure and benchmark those data through our biennial <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">VC Human Capital Survey</a>.</p>
<p>The goals of the survey — powered by the National Venture Capital Association, Venture Forward and Deloitte — are to collect demographic data on the VC workforce across all firm types, sizes, stages, sectors and geographies, as well as trends on firm talent management and recruitment practices. We&#8217;ve learned that progress can be slow and seem discouraging, but we&#8217;ve also captured evidence that diversity (and firm practices to advance diversity) is increasing in some areas, even as other areas have unfortunately not seen the same pace of change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			To begin with, as an industry, venture capital can only improve what we measure.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We fielded the survey in 2016, 2018 and 2020, and released the outcomes of the third edition last month, featuring data (as of June 30, 2020) collected from 378 firms, a marked increase from 203 participating firms in 2018. Furthermore, more than 145 firms signed the <a href="https://nvca.org/nvca-and-venture-forward-vchumancapital-pledge/">#VCHumanCapital pledge</a> to publicly commit to submitting their DEI data.</p>
<p>At a high level, the data showed that improvements in diversity among investment partners have largely been driven by the hiring and advancement of female investors, while there has been little progress in the equitable representation of Black or Hispanic investment partners.</p>
<p>However, the demographic composition of junior investment professionals reflects greater diversity and wider adoption of diversity-focused talent management and recruitment practices suggest some cause for optimism. The industry still has a long way to go, but here are some of the key insights and changes we identified from the latest survey.</p>
<h2>Intentionality associated with improved diversity</h2>
<p>More firms are explicitly assigning responsibility for promoting diversity and inclusion internally &#8212; 50% of firms have a staff person or team tasked with this responsibility (compared with 34% in 2018 and 16% in 2016). Simultaneously, diversity and inclusion strategies have become more widespread; 43% of firms have implemented a diversity strategy (against 32% in 2018 and 24% in 2016), while 41% have an inclusion strategy (versus 31% in 2018 and 17% in 2016).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EWYXnpHAVS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/">On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/embed/#?secret=EWYXnpHAVS" data-secret="EWYXnpHAVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This intentionality translates to improved diversity outcomes. Firms with dedicated DEI staff, strategies and programs achieve greater gender and racial diversity on investment teams and among investment partners. The increased emphasis on DEI is also a broader ecosystem trend. More firms report that limited partners and portfolio companies have requested their DEI details over the past 12 months.</p>
<h2>Encouraging signs in talent recruitment and development</h2>
<p>Venture firms are relatively small and turnover is generally low, but 21% of firms in 2020 reported their number of senior-level investment positions had increased, while 43% said their number of junior-level positions had expanded. Meanwhile, the demographic composition of junior investment professionals reflects higher gender and racial diversity, a positive leading indicator for the diversity of future investment partners.</p>
<p>As overall DEI strategies have become increasingly widespread, more firms have also developed DEI-focused recruitment and hiring programs — 33% of firms have <em>formal</em> programs, while 74% have <em>informal</em> programs, both reflecting steady increases from 2016. Firms were also more likely to report that they typically seek external candidates for open positions than they did in 2018.</p>
<p>However, firms continue to largely rely on internal networks for recruitment, which often encourages homogeneous hiring outcomes. Between the 2018 and 2020 surveys, there was little change shown in the use of narrow recruitment methods to find external candidates; notifying peers in the VC industry (78%) and notifying the firm internally (59%) were the strategies cited most often. The exception was posting on third-party websites like LinkedIn or in newsletters, a strategy reported by 54% of firms in 2020 (a substantial increase from 37% in 2018), which presents one avenue to reach a broader audience of candidates outside of existing networks.</p>
<h2>Assessing inclusion remains a challenge</h2>
<p>Once talent has come on board, inclusive culture and retention become key metrics of DEI progress. More firms are implementing programs dedicated to leadership development, mentorship and retention, with about two-thirds reporting <em>informal</em> versions of such programs (20 percentage points higher than in 2016) and 20% of firms reporting <em>formal</em> programs.</p>
<p>Assessing inclusion through the VC Human Capital Survey is challenging because we survey one representative per firm, and one person cannot speak to the degree of inclusion felt by others. However, we added a new question to the 2020 survey to gauge how firms themselves are assessing inclusion. While 41% of firms reported having an inclusion strategy, only 26% said they conduct surveys of their employees to assess inclusion.</p>
<h2>Subjective factors remain a key consideration in promotions</h2>
<p>Well-structured, consistently applied policies for career advancement are critical to ensuring that diverse talent reaches the most senior decision-making levels of the industry. About 20% of firms reported having <em>formal</em> DEI programs focused on promotion (up from 5% in 2016), while 65% of firms have <em>informal</em> programs (compared with 39% in 2016).</p>
<p>Although DEI programs focused on the promotion of employees are more widespread, subjective factors remain a key consideration for promotion decisions, which can lead to unequal and biased outcomes.</p>
<p>Almost all firms reported that “contributions to the performance of the fund” (90%) and “deal origination” (82%) were very important or important factors in considering promotions. However, the factor most often rated highly was “soft skills,” with 94% of firms saying it was very important or important. These types of subjective factors present significant opportunity for unconscious bias to creep in and can detract from the weight given to objective measures more demonstrably relevant to performance.</p>
<h2>Maintaining momentum</h2>
<p>The results of the third edition of our survey are timely, coming on the heels of a year in which social justice and racial equity have been the subjects of sharp national focus, policymakers have sought to increase access to capital for underserved communities, and the VC industry has shown a renewed focus on DEI. The survey shows where the VC industry’s efforts should be focused and also serves as an important reminder of the intersectional needs of DEI-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>The data show that progress within one demographic element can be more nuanced when considering people who represent multiple marginalized communities (e.g., the percentage of investment partners who are women has steadily increased, but the percentage of investment partners who are women of color has not).</p>
<p>The pace of DEI progress has been slow and uneven in some areas, but there are reasons for optimism. On April 6, NVCA, Venture Forward and Deloitte hosted a discussion with industry leaders to further examine the latest survey results and to address DEI challenges, opportunities and strategies for the industry. More firms are prioritizing these constructive conversations, both within their firms and publicly with industry peers. More firms are acting in a collaborative spirit, adopting thoughtful and concrete DEI strategies and acting with intentionality and urgency.</p>
<p>If the industry can continue to build upon this momentum and commitment around DEI efforts, we can reach a tipping point that will translate to meaningful progress reflected in future editions of the survey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> CEO Paul Cormier runs the centerpiece of IBM&#8217;s transformation hopes. When<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/29/assessing-ibms-34-billion-red-hat-acquisition/"> Big Blue paid $34 billion</a> for his company in 2018, it was because it believed it could be the linchpin of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">the organization&#8217;s shift to a focus on hybrid </a>computing.</p>
<p>In its most recent earnings report, IBM posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/ibm-breaks-latest-revenue-losing-streak-as-cloud-revenue-shows-modest-growth/">positive revenue growth</a> for only the second time in eight quarters, and it was Red Hat&#8217;s 15% growth that led the way. Cormier recognizes the role his company plays for IBM, and he doesn&#8217;t shy away from it.</p>
<p>As he told me in an interview this week ahead of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit">Red Hat Summit</a>, a lot of cloud technology is based on Linux, and as the company that originally made its name selling Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), he says that is a technology his organization is very comfortable working with. He sees the two companies working well together, with Red Hat benefitting from having IBM sell his company&#8217;s software, while remaining neutral technologically, something that benefits customers and pushes the overall IBM vision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Quite a first year</h2>
<p>Even though Cormier has been with Red Hat for 20 years, he took over as its CEO after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">Arvind Krishna replaced Ginni Rometty</a> as IBM&#8217;s chief executive and long-time Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst moved over to a role at IBM last April. Cormier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/new-red-hat-ceo-paul-cormier-faces-a-slew-of-challenges-in-the-midst-of-pandemic/">stepped in as leader</a> just as the pandemic hit the U.S. with its full force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going into my first year of a pandemic, no one knew what the business was going to look like, and not that we&#8217;re completely out of the woods yet, but we have weathered that pretty well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is because like many software companies, he has seen his customers shifting to the cloud much faster than anyone thought previously. While the pandemic acted as a forcing event for digital transformation, it has left many companies to manage a hybrid on-prem and cloud environment, a place where Red Hat can help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a hybrid architecture brings a lot of value [&#8230;], but it&#8217;s complex. It just doesn&#8217;t happen by magic, and I think we helped a lot of customers, and it accelerated a lot of things by years of what was going to happen anyways,&#8221; Cormier told me.</p>
<p>In terms of the workforce moving to work from home, Red Hat had 25% of its workforce doing that even before the pandemic, so the transition wasn&#8217;t as hard as you might think for a company of its size. &#8220;Most every meeting at Red Hat had someone on remotely [before the pandemic]. And so we just sort of flipped into that mode overnight. I think we had an easier time than others for that reason,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>Acting as IBM&#8217;s growth engine</h2>
<p>Red Hat&#8217;s 15% growth was a big reason for IBM showing modest revenue growth last quarter, something that has been hard to come by for the last seven years. At <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4419917-international-business-machines-corporations-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-on-q1-2021-results?part=single">IBM&#8217;s earnings call</a> with analysts, CEO Krishna and CFO Jim Kavanaugh both saw Red Hat maintaining that double digit growth as key to driving the company toward more stable positive revenue in the coming years.</p>
<p>Cormier says that he anticipates the same things that IBM expects &#8212; and that Red Hat is up to the task ahead of it. &#8220;We see that growth continuing to happen as it&#8217;s a huge market, and this is the way it&#8217;s really playing out. We share the optimism,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>While he understands that Red Hat must remain neutral and work with multiple cloud partners, IBM is free to push Red Hat, and having that kind of sales clout behind it is also helping drive Red Hat revenue. &#8220;What IBM does for us is they open the door for us in many more places. They are in many more countries than we were [prior to the acquisition], and they have a lot of high-level relationships where they can open the door for us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In fact, Cormier points out that IBM salespeople have quotas to push Red Hat in their biggest accounts. &#8220;IBM sales is very incentivized to bring Red Hat in to help solve customer problems with Red Hat products,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM breaks latest revenue losing streak as cloud revenue shows modest growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/ibm-breaks-latest-revenue-losing-streak-as-cloud-revenue-shows-modest-growth/embed/#?secret=0beuw2z2N6" data-secret="0beuw2z2N6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>No pressure or anything</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re being billed as a savior of sorts for a company as storied as IBM, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising for Cormier to feel the weight of those expectations. But if he is he doesn&#8217;t seem to show it. While he acknowledges that there is pressure, he argues that it&#8217;s no different from being a public company, only the stakeholders have changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s pressure, but prior to [being acquired] we were a public company. I look at Arvind as the chairman of the board and IBM as our shareholders. Our shareholders put a lot of pressure on us too [when we were public]. So I don&#8217;t feel any more pressure with IBM and with Arvind than we had with our shareholders,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although they represent only 5% of IBM&#8217;s revenue at present, Cormier knows it isn&#8217;t really about that number, per se. It&#8217;s about what his team does and how that fits in with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">IBM&#8217;s transformation strategy overall.</a></p>
<p>Being under pressure to deliver quarter after quarter is the job of any CEO, especially one that&#8217;s in the position of running a company like Red Hat under a corporation like IBM, but Cormier as always appears to be comfortable in his own skin and confident in his company&#8217;s ability to continue chugging along as it has been with that double-digit growth. The market potential is definitely there. It&#8217;s up to Red and Hat and IBM to take advantage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=earnedmediapost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch&#8217;s Early Stage 2021</a> is back for part two of our bootcamp-for-entrepreneurs event, with a focus on marketing and fundraising. Building on the first half of the event in April, this two-day virtual sprint will take place July 8 &amp; 9, and we&#8217;re thrilled to welcome Rebecca Reeve Henderson as one of our all-star slate of experts. Rebecca will be joining us to share insight on how to build an effective earned media strategy for your startup, building on her deep expertise developing effective communications programs for some of the top business software companies in the world.</p>
<p>Earned media, aka the kind of exposure you get from a TechCrunch article, is a key element of any startup&#8217;s marketing strategy. It&#8217;s something that is best used as a complementary component to paid marketing and owned channel promotional efforts, but it&#8217;s also one of the trickiest things to get right, especially for first-time founders. Rebecca has worked with companies ranging from Slack, to Shopify, to Zapier, to Canva and many more, helping craft effective earned media strategies in one of the most difficult areas of all: B2B SaaS.</p>

<p>Rebecca is also a founder herself, having built her communications company Rsquared from the ground up into an international business spanning the U.S. and Canada. Rsquared&#8217;s clients included startups at all stages of growth, from their very beginnings through to successful exits, including public market debuts, so she&#8217;s run effective communications campaigns at every point on the growth spectrum. Then in 2019, Rsquared had its own exit, with an acquisition by global communications firm Archetype.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear tips from Rebecca on how earned media contributes to an effective overall communications strategy, and how you go about earning that media — including how to pitch media, and how to build successful long-term relationships with key reporters and publications in your industry.</p>
<p>Tickets for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=earnedmediapost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> are available until this Friday at the early bird rate which gives you an instant $100 savings! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=earnedmediapost&amp;display=true">Secure your seat</a> before this weekend!</p>

<p>Among the five startups launched in 2020 that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/startups-founded-in-2020">raised the most financing</a>, four were based outside the Bay Area. Prominent VCs like <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/tech-icon-criticizes-San-Francisco-Keith-Rabois-15746116.php#:~:text=Bay%20Area%20tech%20icon%20Keith,to%20stay%22%20in%20San%20Francisco.">Keith Rabois</a> of Founders Fund, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/12/01/prominent-venture-capitalist-joins-bay-area-exodus.html">David Blumberg</a> of Blumberg Capital, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/palantir-co-founder-joe-lonsdale-leaving-silicon-valley.html">Joe Lonsdale</a> of 8VC have moved out of the Bay Area to new emerging tech hubs, which AngelList defines as Austin, Texas; Seattle; Denver; Portland, Oregon; Brooklyn, New York; Nashville, Tennessee; Pittsburgh; and Miami.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The number of syndicated deals on AngelList in emerging markets has increased 144% over the last five years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The number of startups in these emerging markets is growing fast, according to AngelList data, and increasingly getting a bigger piece of the VC pie.</p>
<p>AngelList compared the performance of startups based in emerging tech hubs to startups in Silicon Valley by internal rate of return (IRR), which measures the rate of growth these investments have generated. AngelList defines “Silicon Valley” as San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Oakland, San Mateo, Berkeley, Redwood City, Menlo Park, San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Burlingame and San Carlos.</p>
<p>According to AngelList&#8217;s data, startups in emerging tech hubs have an aggregate IRR of 19.4% per year on syndicated deals on AngelList. Syndicated deals on AngelList in Silicon Valley have an aggregate IRR of 17.5% per year.</p>
<p>Total value to paid-in (TVPI), which is the return multiple net of fees, is also slightly higher for AngelList deals in emerging tech hubs (1.67x) than Silicon Valley (1.60x). This means for every $1 invested into startups based in emerging tech hubs, the investor’s portfolio is now valued at $1.67, compared to $1.60 for Silicon Valley startups.</p>
<p>This data is based on a sample of nearly 2,500 syndicated deals on AngelList dating back to 2013, with returns current as of January 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Investors we spoke with offered a variety of reasons for the rise of these emerging tech hubs, including cheaper taxes outside the Bay Area, lower cost of living and a wider distribution of talent brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>AGENDA</h2>
<p><strong>Self-Driving Deliveries with Ahti Heinla (Starship), Amy Jones Satrom (Nuro) and Apeksha Kumavat (Gatik)</strong></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles and robotics were well on their way transforming deliveries before the pandemic struck. In the past year, these technologies have moved from novel applications to essential innovations. We’re joined by a trio of companies — each with individual approaches that span the critical middle and last mile of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision with Alexandr Wang (Scale AI)</strong></p>
<p>Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</p>
<p><strong>Will Venture Capital Drive the Future of Mobility? with Clara Brenner (Urban Innovation Fund), Quin Garcia (Autotech Ventures) and Rachel Holt (Construct Capital)</strong></p>
<p>Clara Brenner, Quin Garcia and Rachel Holt will discuss how the pandemic changed their investment strategies, the hottest sectors within the mobility industry, the rise of SPACs as a financial instrument and where they plan to put their capital in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>From Concept to Commuter Car &#8212; and Beyond with Jesse Levinson (Zoox)</strong></p>
<p>Zoox unveiled the design of its fit-for-purpose autonomous vehicle for the first time, after years of development and much anticipation. Meanwhile, the company was also acquired by Amazon in a high-profile deal that looks to give the company ample runway, while keeping its operations independent. We’ll hear from co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson about what it’s like building an autonomous car company in the shadows of a commerce giant.</p>
<p><strong>EV Founders in Focus with Ben Schippers (TezLab)</strong></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. We&#8217;ll chat with Ben Schippers, co-founder and CEO of TezLab, an app that operates like a Fitbit for Tesla vehicles (and soon other EVs) and allows drivers to go deep into their driving data. The app also breaks down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy coming from charging locations.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Flight with JoeBen Bevirt (Joby Aviation) and Reid Hoffman (Reinvent Technology Partners)</strong></p>
<p>Joby Aviation founder JoeBen Bevirt spent more than a decade quietly developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft. Now he is preparing for a new phase of growth as Joby Aviation merges with the special purpose acquisition company formed by famed investor and Linked co-founder Reid Hoffman. Bevirt and Hoffman will come to our virtual stage to talk about the how build a startup (and keep it secret while raising funds), the future of flight and, of course, SPACs.</p>
<p><strong>Equity, Accessibility and Cities with Tamika L. Butler (Tamika L. Butler Consulting), Tiffany Chu (Remix by Via) and Frank Reig (Revel)</strong></p>
<p>Can mobility be accessible, equitable and remain profitable? We have brought together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler; Remix co-founder and CEO Tiffany Chu and Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig to discuss how (and if) shared mobility can provide equity in cities, while still remaining a viable and even profitable business. The trio will also dig into the challenges facing cities and how policy may affect startups.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Robotaxis in China with Tony Han (WeRide), Jewel Li (AutoX) and Huan Sun (Momenta Europe)</strong></p>
<p>Silicon Valley has long been viewed as a hub for autonomous vehicle development. But another country is also leading the charge. Executives from three leading Chinese robotaxi companies (that also have operations in Europe or the U.S.) will join us to provide insight into the unique challenges of developing and deploying the technology in China and how it compares to other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored by Plus: Delivering Supervised Autonomous Trucks Globally with Shawn Kerrigan (Plus)</strong></p>
<p>Plus is applying autonomous driving technology to launch supervised autonomous trucks today in order to dramatically improve safety, efficiency and driver comfort, while addressing critical challenges in long-haul trucking — driver shortage and high turnover, rising fuel costs, and reaching sustainability goals. Mass production of our supervised autonomous driving solution, PlusDrive, starts this summer. In the next few years, tens of thousands of heavy trucks powered by PlusDrive will be on the road. Plus’s COO and Co-Founder Shawn Kerrigan will introduce PlusDrive and our progress of deploying this driver-in solution globally. He will also share our learnings from working together with world-leading OEMs and fleet partners to develop and deploy autonomous trucks at scale.</p>
<p><strong>Driving Innovation at General Motors with Pam Fletcher (GM)</strong></p>
<p>GM is in the midst of sweeping changes that will eventually turn it into an EV-only producer of cars, trucks and SUVs. But the auto giant&#8217;s push to electrify passenger vehicles is just one of many efforts to be a leader in innovation and the future of transportation. We&#8217;ll talk with Pam Fletcher, vice president of innovation at GM, one of the key people behind the 113-year-old automaker&#8217;s push to become a nimble, tech-centric company.</p>
<p><strong>AVs: Past, Present and Future with Karl Iagnemma (Motional) and Chris Urmson (Aurora)</strong></p>
<p>TechCrunch Mobility will talk to two pioneers, and competitors, who are leading the charge to commercialize autonomous vehicles. Karl Iagnemma, president of the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, and Chris Urmson, the co-founder and CEO of Aurora, will discuss — and maybe even debate — the best approach to AV development and deployment, swap stories of the earliest days of the industry and provide a few forecasts of what&#8217;s to come.</p>
<p><strong>EV Founders in Focus</strong></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. This time, we will chat with Kameale Terry, co-founder and CEO of ChargerHelp! a startup that enables on-demand repair of electric vehicle charging stations.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored by: Wejo: Making Mobility Data Accessible to Governmental Agencies to Meet New Transportation Demands with Bret Scott (Wejo)</strong></p>
<p>Wejo provides accurate and unbiased unique journey data, curated from millions of connected cars, to help local, state, province and federal government agencies visualize traffic and congestion conditions. Unlock a deeper understanding of mobility trends, to make better decisions, support policy development and solve problems more effectively for your towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility&#8217;s Robotic Future with James Kuffner (Toyota Research Institute)</strong></p>
<p>More than ever, automotive manufacturers are looking to robotics as the future of mobility, from manufacturing to autonomy and beyond. We’ll be speaking to the head of robotics initiatives at one of the world&#8217;s largest automakers  to find out how the technology is set to transform the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might know him for his viral tweets, but <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak">Turner Novak</a> wasn’t always a master meme-maker.</p>
<p>Instead, Novak grew up with a single mother in the United States. The financial situation of his family led to the internet being not always accessible. They often hop-scotched between discounted trials and went months without access. The experience, he says, was formative in his relationship with technology more broadly.</p>
<p>“It really made me appreciate just how impactful and how important the internet is” he said. “And it [taught] me how to use it efficiently.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, the investor has started a firm peeled from the ethos. <a href="https://www.bananacapital.vc/">Banana Capital </a>is a firm that will seed and source consumer tech founders from the corners of the web. The oversubscribed debut fund is $9.99 million and the average check size is between $25,000 to $300,000. Investors in Banana Capital include Winnie co-founder Sara Mauskopf, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Sriram Krishnan and GGV managing partner Hans Tung. VC Starter Kit, a meme account for tech Twitter, is also an LP.</p>
<p>Novak will be investing in the broad consumer sector, with specific interest in early-stage startups in the social, healthcare and e-commerce sector. He is targeting ownership between 0.2% to 3%. Comparatively, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/cleo-capital-is-targeting-20-million-for-fund-ii/">Cleo Capital</a>, a pre-seed stage with the same assets under management, leads checks and targets between 15% to 20% ownership in its rounds.</p>
<p>Novak says he made a choice to actively target low ownership instead of leading rounds to give him flexibility in what stages to play in long term.</p>
<h2><strong>Memes and banana peels</strong></h2>
<p>Novak describes Banana Capital as an internet-first fund. But while that phrase can often be a buzzword, his track record gives some color on how a network built by the internet, instead of geography, looks.</p>

<p>Novak’s vibe might be best shown in his meme game. Novak was part of the Eye Mouth Eye ( <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f441.png" alt="👁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f444.png" alt="👄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f441.png" alt="👁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) campaign that rocked Silicon Valley in June 2020, that used meme culture to illustrate how FOMO and hype are what catch investor attention. He is one of a handful of investors who religiously post memes on Twitter and TikTok about tech. He has a recurring series about audio social app Clubhouse and its fundraisers. One of his viral tweets was a mock video of a startup pitching to a VC, which racked up more than 186,200 views on Twitter, as well as a handful of duets on TikTok.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1386802659492040704">some</a> of his tweets are <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1386505092489269248">simply for the spice</a>, the memes have become somewhat of a strategy for the emerging fund manager. His <a href=" https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1318364304895299584 ">mock pitch video</a>, for example, led to an investment in a company. Founders often directly message him after a tweet inviting him to join an open cap table slot. The strategy is part of his differentiation when it comes to deal flow. Banana Capital’s portfolio has 11 known investments, including Flexbase, Skillful and Bottomless.</p>

<p>“It just kind of happens where [my investments] are people who understand the culture of the internet, to understand memes and understand wit and humor and appreciate that a little bit more,” he said. &#8220;Those are probably the people that are more naturally intuitive investments, so it definitely does skew that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Novak didn’t share explicit targets or mandates around investment in diverse founders, he pointed to his track record at Gelt VC, in which 41% of capital went to woman CEOs. To date, 65% of Banana Capital&#8217;s portfolio founding teams include non-white founders and 50% of the teams include more than one gender.</p>
<p>Novak plans on staying in Ann Arbor, Michigan for the foreseeable future, but couldn’t resist<a href="http://www.banana.miami/"> a poke</a> at Miami, a growing, buzzy tech hub. URL jokes aside, his geography, so to speak, will be the internet.</p>
<p>“My network is not in San Francisco and New York, it&#8217;s more so just people like on the internet,” he said. “That’s just how I meet people.”</p>
<p>Novak had multiple explanations for why he is choosing to call his firm Banana Capital. First, bananas are one of the most consumed fruits out there and have been through numerous iterations and bio-engineering processes throughout history, with a nod to the focus of his investments in the consumer sphere.</p>
<p>Second? “There really are no fruit funds out there,” he said. “My vibe is that I take myself a little less seriously than other people and the name just reflected that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>, the privately-held payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $95 billion</a>, has made an acquisition to expand the range of tools (and services) that it provides to online businesses. It has acquired <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaxJar</a>, a popular provider of a cloud-based suite of tax services, which can be used to automatically calculate, report and file sales taxes.</p>
<p>One key point about TaxJar is that it works across a number of geographies and the many different sales tax regimes that each uses &#8212; a complex area for a lot of companies that do business online.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but for some context the company was valued at $179 million post-money when it last raised money, in January 2019, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/61929-28/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stripe has confirmed that all 200 employees of Woburn, Massachusetts-based TaxJar are joining the company.</p>
<p>Stripe will be integrating TaxJar technology into its revenue platform &#8212; where it will sit alongside Stripe Billing (its subscription tools) and Radar (its fraud prevention technology), and potentially build <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/press/taxjar-pioneers-sales-tax-space-with-first-ai-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new services using AI</a> and other technology to automate more functions &#8212; but businesses can continue to use TaxJar directly, too.</p>
<p>Launched in 2013, TaxJar today has around 23,000 customers. Stripe didn&#8217;t comment on how much of an overlap the two companies have in terms of users, but both have over the years gained a lot of traction with startups and other online businesses, which is likely one reason why TaxJar caught Stripe&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>“There’s a reason TaxJar has been a top choice for businesses: their software tools make it incredibly easy to handle sales tax,” said Dhivya Suryadevara, Stripe’s CFO, in a statement. “With TaxJar, we will help millions of internet businesses running on Stripe with their sales tax and make it easier for them to sell internationally. And as a CFO, I&#8217;m delighted to welcome so many new colleagues who care deeply about tax calculation and reporting!”</p>
<p>When TaxJar last raised money &#8212; a <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/press/taxjar-closes-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$60 million round</a> in 2019 led by Insight Partners &#8212; it mentioned that it had been profitable since 2016 (fueled by a $2 million investment in 2014 from Rincon Venture Partners and Daher Capital), and said it had 15,000 customers, so that base has been growing (specifically, 53% in two years).</p>
<p>Stripe has actually made some moves in the area of tax before, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/stripe-acquires-payable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying Payable back in 2017</a> to help with 1099 reporting for customers who pay contractors, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/stripe-intuit-on-demand-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering with Intuit</a> to help on-demand workers manage their finances. The TaxJar acquisition, however, is filling a noticeable gap in its native product set, as well as a pain point for its customers, specifically in the area of sales tax.</p>
<p>Stripe says that adding sales tax collection and remittance &#8212; a complex system that covers as much as 11,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S. alone &#8212; was one of the most-requested features among users, a fact that users themselves have lamented openly:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every week I see someone from <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stripe</a> tweet “What should we build next for y’all?” and the #1 reply is always people screaming “US sales tax collection and remittance!”&#8230; then I watch OP respond to every *other* reply. It drives me insane. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92a.png" alt="🤪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Justin Klemm (@justinklemm) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinklemm/status/1352097199660822529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ironically, if you link through on the above Tweet, you&#8217;ll see in <a href="https://twitter.com/TimHaines/status/1352101002447446023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one thread</a>, TaxJar comes up in the conversation.</p>
<p>Indeed, TaxJar was already &#8220;<a href="https://stripe.com/partners/taxjar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully integrated</a>&#8221; with Stripe as a <a href="https://support.taxjar.com/article/349-does-taxjar-work-with-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner</a>, meaning businesses could use TaxJar to calculate and manage sales taxes on transactions powered by Stripe. But using the two together required logging into TaxJar, creating a separate account, and then getting a unique URL to paste into your Stripe Orders settings to run the services together: not the picture of simplicity that Stripe generally presents to users.</p>
<p>Some of that will now become smoother for Stripe customers as part of its bigger push for more automated tools to cover the more repetitive aspects of the online sales transactions process. (Other automated areas include algorithms around payment rejection, billing methods and so on.)</p>
<p>“Like everyone at Stripe, we think every day about how we can help startups and multinational companies alike remove barriers to growing their business,” said Mark Faggiano, CEO and founder of TaxJar, in a statement. “And what that means is making the complicated work of sales tax compliance as straightforward as possible. We know that to grow the GDP of the internet, compliance is critical. We couldn’t be more excited to join Stripe and help power millions of businesses around the world.”</p>

<p>Stripe noted that the sorts of services that TaxJar covers include providing accurate, localized sales tax rates at checkout, submitting tax returns to local jurisdictions and remitting the sales tax collected, producing itemized, local jurisdiction reports to show sales and sales tax collected, and suggesting the right product tax code based on a company’s products.</p>
<p>That TaxJar is coming into the deal with its own customer base and revenue model is important for another reason: it&#8217;s a sign of more diversification for Stripe &#8212; key as the $95 billion company continues to grow and inch potentially toward a public listing, now being considered for late 2021 or early 2022, according to rumors. Other signs of that diversification strategy include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe&#8217;s acquisition of Paystack last year out of Nigeria</a> to help it break into payments in Africa, a deal it made for over $200 million.</p>
<p>(TaxJar&#8217;s <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS pricing</a> starts at $19/month and goes up from there, including an enterprise tier that will be handy for Stripe&#8217;s <a href="https://stripe.com/use-cases/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform product</a>.)</p>
<p>Stripe made revenues of $1.6 billion (<a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1382042281578991621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or as much as $7.6 billion</a>!&#8230; Stripe declined to comment on both numbers) in 2020, according to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-payment-processor-stripe-became-silicon-valleys-hottest-startup-11618306201?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this profile in the WSJ</a>, but it was also buffeted pretty significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some sectors where Stripe has played strong, like travel, saw a big drop in transactions, while others, like e-commerce, saw a much bigger surge.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UCs2lks56x"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/no-taxation-without-innovation-the-rise-of-tax-startups/">No taxation without innovation: The rise of tax startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No taxation without innovation: The rise of tax startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/no-taxation-without-innovation-the-rise-of-tax-startups/embed/#?secret=UCs2lks56x" data-secret="UCs2lks56x" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One takeaway from that might be: regardless of what our &#8220;new normal&#8221; will look like, it seems that e-commerce in one form or another will continue to grow, so offering a wider range of services, like automatic sales tax calculations and reporting around its core business of payments will help Stripe grow revenues per user to offset the ups and downs of specific business lines when and if they arise again.</p>
<p>The area of tax-tech sits somewhere between e-commerce and fintech and has found its own steam in recent years, following both the growing size of the e-commerce market and the evolution in fintech, where startups are building the complex processes that are not the core competency of their target customers and putting them into products that are easy to use and integrate. Others in the same space as TaxJar include Avalara, Vertx and Sovos, among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/no-taxation-without-innovation-the-rise-of-tax-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider field of startups</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the never-ending stream of funding rounds, from time to time, a group of startups working on the same problem will raise money nearly in unison. So it was with OKR software last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the never-ending stream of venture capital funding rounds, from time to time, a group of startups working on the same problem will raise money nearly in unison. So it was with OKR-focused startups toward the start of 2020.</p>
<p>How were so many OKR-focused tech upstarts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">able to raise capital at the same time</a>? And was there really space in the market for so many different startups building software to help other companies manage their goal-setting? OKRs, or &#8220;objectives and key results,&#8221; a corporate planning method, are no longer a niche concept. But surely, over time, there would be M&amp;A in the group, right?</p>
<p>During our first look into the cohort, we concluded that it felt likely that there was &#8220;some consolidation&#8221; ahead for the group &#8220;when growth becomes more difficult.&#8221; At the time, however, it was clear that many founders and investors expected the OKR software market to have material depth.</p>
<p>They were right, and we were wrong. A year later, in early 2021, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">asked the same group how their previous year had gone</a>. Nearly every single company had a killer year, with many players growing by well over 100%.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>OKR company <a href="http://ally.io">Ally.io</a> grew 3.3x in 2020, for example, while its competitor Gtmhub grew by 3x over the same time period. More capital followed. Ally.io <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/">raised $50 million in a Series C</a> in the first quarter, while <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a> put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">a $30 million Series B</a> during the same period.</p>
<p>They won’t be the final startups in the OKR cohort to raise this year. We know this because we reached out to the group again this week, this time probing their Q1 performance, and, critically, asking the startups to discuss their level of optimism regarding the rest of 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As before, the group’s recent results are strong, at least when compared to their own planning. But notably, the collection of competing companies is more optimistic than before about the rest of the year than they were before Q1 2021. Things are heating up for the OKR startup world.</p>
<p>A takeaway from our work today is that our prior notes about how impressively deep the software market is proving to be may have been too modest. And frankly, that’s super-good news for startups and investors alike. So much for SaaS-fatigue.</p>
<p>In a sense, we should not be surprised that OKR startups are doing well or that the startup software market is so large. You’d imagine that the historic pace of venture capital investment that we’ve seen so far in 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">in Europe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">the United States</a> was based on results, or evidence that there was lots more room for software-focused startups to grow.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while these companies look similar to outsiders, they are each betting on strategies and differentiators that could help them win in their selected portion of the OKR space. Which also means that the sector may not be as crowded as it seems.</p>
<p>Don’t take our word for it. Let’s hear from Gtmhub COO <a href="https://twitter.com/sethaelliott?lang=en">Seth Elliott</a>, <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">Workboard</a> CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/day_dree">Deidre Paknad</a>, <a href="https://www.koan.co/okrs">Koan</a> CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/matttucker">Matt Tucker</a>, Ally.io CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/vetri_vellore?lang=en">Vetri Vellore</a>, and <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a> CEO and founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikjanvanderpol/?originalSubdomain=nl">Henrik-Jan van der Pol</a> about just what the software market looks like to them.</p>
<p>We’ll start with how the startups performed in Q1 2021, dig into how they feel about the rest of the year, and then talk about how differentiation among the cohort could be helping them not step on each other’s toes.</p>
<h2>Rapid growth</h2>
<p>WorkBoard is having a strong start to 2021. Paknad’s company, which raised in both March of 2019 and January of 2020, told The Exchange that it hired 82 people in the first three months of 2021, and that it plans on doing it again in the current quarter. WorkBoard is &#8220;investing heavily,&#8221; Paknad said via DM, and &#8220;made [its] Q1 targets.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Antonio-based Plus One Robotics today announced <a href="https://plusonerobotics.com/blog/2021-04-Partner-Expansion/">a $33 million Series B</a>. The round follows an $8.3 million Series A announced in 2018 and brings the company’s total funding to north of $40 million. The round, led by McRock Capital and TransLink Ventures, features BMWi Ventures, Kensington Capital Partners and Ironspring Ventures, along with existing investors.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, the company is primarily focused on computer vision software for robotics in logistics and warehouse settings &#8212; clearly a hot category as more companies look to automate their back end. Specifically, the system is designed to be adaptable to a wide range of robotic arms and grippers, which tend to fill different needs for the end user.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding to expand operations internationally to keep up with the accelerated demand for robotics. The system also allows for group management, controlling up to 50 robots at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are excited to grow alongside our clients here and abroad. Like our clients, our investors have a global footprint representing Asia and the EU as well as North America,” CEO and co-founder Erik Nieves said in a release tied to the news. “This potent combination sets Plus One on a course to continue growing our international installed base.”</p>
<p>The round also finds Whitney Rockley of McRock Capital and Toshi Otani of TransLink joining Plus One’s board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.materials.zone/">Materials Zone</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses AI to speed up materials research, today announced that it has raised a $6 million seed funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>, with participation from crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform consists of a number of different tools, but at the core is a database that takes in data from scientific instruments, manufacturing facilities, lab equipment, external databases, published articles, Excel sheets and more, and then parses it and standardizes it. Simply having this database, the company argues, is a boon for researchers, who can then also visualize it as needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to develop new technologies and physical products, companies must first understand the materials that comprise those products, as well as those materials’ properties,&#8221; said Materials Zone founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/assafanderson/">Dr. Assaf Anderson</a>. &#8220;Understanding the science of materials has therefore become a driving force behind innovation. However, the data behind materials R&amp;D and production has traditionally been poorly managed, unstructured, and underutilized, often leading to redundant experiments, limited capacity to build on past experience, and an inability to effectively collaborate, which inevitably wastes countless dollars and man-hours.”</p>

<p>&#8220;As a materials scientist, I have experienced R&amp;D challenges firsthand, thereby gaining an understanding of how R&amp;D can be improved,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;We developed our platform with our years of experience in mind, leveraging innovative AI/ML technologies to create a unique solution for these problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that in order to, for example, develop a new photovoltaic transparent window, it would take thousands of experiments to find the right core materials and their parameters. The promise of Materials Zone is that it can make this process faster and cheaper by aggregating and standardizing all of this data and then offer data and workflow management tools to work with it. Meanwhile, the company&#8217;s analytical and machine learning tools can help researchers interpret this data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/amazon-debuts-a-scale-model-autonomous-car-to-teach-developers-machine-learning/">Amazon debuted AWS DeepRacer in 2018</a>, it was meant as a fun way to help developers learn machine learning. While it has evolved since and incorporated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/aws-reorganizes-deepracer-league-to-encourage-more-newbies/">DeepRacer competitions</a>, today the company announced it was adding a new wrinkle. It&#8217;s open sourcing the software the company created to run these miniature cars.</p>
<p>At its core, the DeepRacer car is a mini computer running Ubuntu Linux and Robot Operating System (ROS), both open source components. The company believes that by opening up the device software to developers, it will encourage more creative uses of the car by enabling them to change the car&#8217;s default behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the open sourcing of the AWS DeepRacer device code you can quickly and easily change the default behavior of your currently track-obsessed race car. Want to block other cars from overtaking it by deploying countermeasures? Want to deploy your own custom algorithm to make the car go faster from point A to B? You just need to dream it and code it,&#8221; the company wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/aws-deepracer-device-software-now-open-source/">in a blog post</a> announcing the open source project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After introducing the cars in 2018, the company has developed in person DeepRacer leagues, and more recently virtual races. In fact, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/aws-reorganizes-deepracer-league-to-encourage-more-newbies/"> reorganized the leagues last month</a> to encourage new people to get involved with the technology. Adding an open source component could increase interest further as developers get a chance to make this their own, and really add new layers of usage to the cars that haven&#8217;t been possible up until now.</p>

<p>The idea behind all of this to teach developers the basics of machine learning, as AWS&#8217; Marcia Villalba<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-leagues-2021-season-launches-with-new-open-and-pro-divisions/"> wrote in a blog post</a> last month:</p>
<p>“AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test [reinforcement learning] models by racing virtually in the AWS DeepRacer console or physically on a track at AWS and customer events. AWS DeepRacer is for developers of all skill levels, even if you don’t have any ML experience. When learning RL using AWS DeepRacer, you can take part in the AWS DeepRacer League where you get experience with machine learning in a fun and competitive environment.”</p>
<p>If you want to get involved customizing your car&#8217;s software, the project documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/aws-deepracer/">GitHub</a> and on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/robotics-projects/">AWS DeepRacer Open Source page</a>, where you can get started with six sample projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company will open a $185 million R&amp;D battery lab to develop and manufacture battery cells and batteries, a first step toward the automaker possibly making battery cells in-house. The facility comes as yet another signal to consumers and other automakers that the auto giant is no longer hedging its bets on the transition to battery electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Company executives declined to provide a timeline on when Ford might scale its battery manufacturing, but it is clear that the company intends this facility to lay the groundwork for such a future.</p>
<p>The Ford Ion Park will be based in southeast Michigan and will be home to more than 150 employees across battery technology development, research and manufacturing. The facility will likely be around 200,000 square feet and will open at the end of 2022. The facility will be supported by Ford’s batteries benchmarking test laboratories in nearby Allen Park, Michigan, which is already testing battery cell construction and chemistries. Also nearby are Ford’s product development center in Dearborn and Ford’s battery cell assembly and e-motor plant in Rossville.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new facility will be led by Anand Sankaran, who is currently Ford’s director of electrified systems engineering. He described it as a “learning lab” to create both “lab-scale and pilot-scale assembly of cells,” including next-gen lithium-ion and solid-state batteries.</p>
<p>Ford is thinking about the transition to BEVs in phases, Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product platform and operations officer, explained. In this first phase, when BEVs are being largely purchased by early adopters, Ford’s working with external supplier partners. The company is now preparing for phase two, when Ford will bring more products to market and BEVs will take more of the market share. “So in preparation for that next transition into the second phase, we want to give Ford the flexibility and the optionality to eventually vertically integrate,” Thai-Tang said.</p>
<p>“Our plan to lead the electric revolution will certainly be dependent on the progress that we make on battery energy density, as well as cost,” Thai-Tang told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The formation of the Ford Ion Park team is a key enabler for Ford to vertically integrate and manufacture batteries in the future,” Thai-Tang said. “This will help us better control our supply and deliver high-volume battery cells with greater range, lower cost and higher quality.”</p>
<p>This would be a huge boost for domestic manufacturing of battery cells, which is dominated by companies based in Asia, such as Panasonic (Tesla’s main supplier), South Korea-based LG Chem and SK Innovation, Ford’s current battery cell supplier. Executives said the global pandemic and the semiconductor shortage have highlighted the importance of having a localized and domestically controlled supply chain.</p>
<p>“We know in terms of batteries, it&#8217;s a very capital-intensive business to be in,” Thai-Tang said. “The best tier one suppliers in the world spend a large amount of their revenue on R&amp;D spending, and then the capital expenditure required to build and stand up battery plants is quite high. So as we think about this, the scale and volume that we would need to have dedicated sites for Ford is a big consideration, and we&#8217;ve talked about how bullish we see this transition happening. We&#8217;re at a point where now, there&#8217;s sufficient scale for us to entertain having greater levels of vertical integration at some point.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://jointoucan.com/">Toucan</a>, a startup that helps users learn a new language while they browse the web, is announcing that it has raised an additional $4.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/toucan-funding/">As I wrote last fall</a>, the Santa Monica, California-based startup has built a Chrome extension that scans the text of whatever website you&#8217;re reading and translates select words into whichever language you&#8217;re trying to learn. That means you&#8217;re expanding your vocabulary without having to make time to study or otherwise change your behavior.</p>
<p>Toucan currently supports seven languages — Spanish, Korean, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. Co-founder and CEO Taylor Nieman said the company now has around 60,000 monthly active users, all acquired organically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;On the surface, Toucan can look like a toy, but there&#8217;s massive engineering tech on the backend,&#8221; Nieman added.</p>
<p>For one thing, although the startup has a team of human translators, it also relies on machine learning and natural language processing to understand the context of each word and make sure it&#8217;s being translated properly. Nieman said that the company also takes an intelligent, personalized approach to the translations that appear over time, allowing them to become more complex in order to keep challenging users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144425" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?w=680" alt="Toucan screenshot" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg 1360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toucan</p></div></p>
<p>Toucan is free, but users can subscribe to Toucan Premium, which starts at $4.99 per month and offers a higher density of translated words. Premium subscribers can also opt in or out of advertising — apparently the ability to &#8220;own&#8221; a word (a.k.a. have your sponsorship message appear anytime that word is translated) is popular enough that some paying users don&#8217;t want to lose it.</p>
<p>Toucan has now raised a total of $7.5 million. The new round was led by LightShed Ventures, with participation from new investors Next Play Ventures, Concrete Rose Capital, GingerBread Capital, Form Capital, Goodwater Capital, Hampton VC, Spacecadet Ventures, GTMfund, Baron Davis Enterprises and Human Ventures, as well as existing investors GSV Ventures, Amplifyher Ventures and Vitalize.</p>

<p>“Screen time is escalating globally with younger generations living their lives always connected,&#8221; said LightShed Ventures General Partner Richard Greenfield in a statement. &#8220;Toucan seamlessly integrates language learning into the websites (and soon apps) you are already using via a simple browser extension transforming screen time into learning time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nieman said Toucan will use the new funding to expand the team from 12 to 16. It&#8217;s also planning to internationalize — so not just translating English to Spanish, but Spanish to English, and so on — and is launching a new Safari extension (it will support more browsers in the future). The ultimate vision is for Toucan to be &#8220;layered wherever you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be this augmented layer of learning on the web, on mobile browsing, in the most popular social apps and even in the physical world,&#8221; she said, predicting that in the future, you might be &#8220;wearing a crazy cool contact lens that can translate a sign on the subway and provide you with those same micro-moments of learning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile social networking app for women, <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, is today becoming the latest tech company to integrate audio into its product following the success of Clubhouse. Peanut, which began with a focus on motherhood, has expanded over the years to support women through all life stages, including pregnancy, marriage and even menopause. It sees its voice chat feature, which it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Pods,&#8221; as a way women on its app can make better connections in a more supportive, safer environment than other platforms may provide.</p>
<p>The pandemic, of course, likely drove some of the interest in audio-based social networking, as people who had been stuck at home found it helped to fill the gap that in-person networking and social events once did. However, voice chat social networking leader Clubhouse has since seen its model turned into what&#8217;s now just a feature for companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> and others to adopt.</p>
<p>Like many of the Clubhouse clones to date, Peanut&#8217;s Pods offer the basics, including a muted audience of listeners who virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to speak, emoji reactions and hosts who can moderate the conversations and invite people to speak, among other things. The company, for now, is doing its own in-house moderation on the audio pods, to ensure the conversations don&#8217;t violate the company&#8217;s terms. In time, it plans to scale to include other moderators. (The company pays over two dozen moderators to help it manage the rest of its app, but the team had not yet been trained on audio, as of just a few days ago. They have now been given the training, we understand.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though there are similarities with Clubhouse in its design, what Peanut believes will differentiate its audio experience from the rest of the pack is where these conversations are taking place &#8212; on a network designed for women built with safety and trust in mind. It&#8217;s also a network where chasing clout is not the reason people participate.</p>
<p>Traditional social networks are often based on how many likes you have, how many followers you have, or if you&#8217;re verified with a blue check, explains Peanut founder CEO Michelle Kennedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of all based around status and popularity,&#8221; she says. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve only ever seen on Peanut is this &#8216;economy of care,&#8217; where women are really supportive of one another. It&#8217;s really never been about, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got X number of followers.&#8217; We don&#8217;t even have that concept. It&#8217;s always been about: &#8216;I need support; I have this question; I&#8217;m lonely or looking for a friend;&#8217; or whatever it might be,&#8221; Kennedy adds.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKE6H5HDf2I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In Peanut Pods, the company says it will continue to enforce the safety standards that make women feel comfortable with social networking. This focus in particular could attract some of the women, and <a href="https://www.thelily.com/women-in-tech-are-networking-through-clubhouse-an-invite-only-app-but-these-black-women-say-its-not-a-place-for-us/">particularly</a> women of color, who have been <a href="https://taylorlorenz.medium.com/clubhouse-moderation-issues-and-incidents-726a88a1b4bd">targeted</a> with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-murky-world-of-moderation-on-clubhouse">harassment</a> on other voice-based networking platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one thing I would say is we&#8217;re a community, and we have standards,&#8221; notes Kennedy. &#8220;When you have standards and you let everyone know what those standards are, it&#8217;s very clear. You&#8217;re allowed an opinion but what you&#8217;re not allowed to do are listed here&#8230;Here are the things we expect of you as a user and we&#8217;ll reward you if you do it and if you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to ask you to leave,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is not what Peanut&#8217;s about, she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have standards and we ask you to adhere to them,&#8221; says Kennedy.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse UX teardown: A closer look at homepage curation, follow hooks and other features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/clubhouse-ux-teardown-a-closer-look-at-homepage-curation-follow-hooks-and-other-features/embed/#?secret=H2eUSHybN8" data-secret="H2eUSHybN8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In time, Peanut envisions using the audio feature to help connect women with people who have specific expertise, like lactation consultants for new moms or fertility doctors, for example. But these will not be positioned as lectures where listeners are held hostage as a speaker drones on and on. In fact, Peanut&#8217;s design does away with the &#8220;stage&#8221; concept from Clubhouse to give everyone equal status &#8212; whether they&#8217;re speaking or not.</p>
<p>In the app, users will be able to find interesting chats based on what topics they&#8217;re already following &#8212; and, importantly, they can avoid being shown other topics by muting them.</p>
<p>The Pods feature is rolling out to Peanut&#8217;s app starting today, where it will reach the company&#8217;s now 2 million-plus users. It will be free to use, like all of Peanut, though the company plans to eventually launch a freemium model with some paid products further down the road.</p>
<p><em>Update, 4/27/21, 3:40 PM ET: Article updated to note moderators have now received Pods training. </em></p>
