<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m on an H-1B living and working in the U.S. I want to apply for a green card on my own. I’m concerned about only relying on my current employer and I want to be able to easily change jobs or create a startup. I’ve been looking at the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m not sure if I would qualify for an EB-1A, but since I was born in India, I face a much longer wait for an EB-2 NIW. Any tips on how to proceed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Inventive from India</strong></p>
<p>Dear Inventive,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question. Take a listen to my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/084-back-to-school-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp-part-1/">podcast episode</a> in which I discuss the latest tech immigration news and delve into the benefits and requirements of the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a> green card for individuals of extraordinary ability and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-2 NIW</a> (National Interest Waiver) green card, which as you know are the main employment-based green cards for which individuals can self-sponsor.</p>
<p>I recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can evaluate your abilities and accomplishments and assess your prospects for each green card. After an initial consultation with new clients, we’re able to provide a lot more detail to folks on their specific options since these are such individualized pathways.</p>
<p>There are some groups of people who might need every advantage. Those can include folks born in India or China, who might face long green card backlogs. Another such group includes people whose skills and accomplishments might be borderline for an EB-1A green card for extraordinary ability. In some cases &#8212; if eligible and to have every opportunity for green card security and to mitigate wait times as much as possible &#8212; our clients choose to file both the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW in parallel.</p>

<p>The EB-1A is the highest priority green card and the standard for qualifying is much higher than for the EB-2 NIW. And that means an EB-1A is typically quicker to get, which is particularly the case now: According to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2021/visa-bulletin-for-august-2021.html">August 2021 Visa Bulletin</a>, there is no wait for an EB-1A green card regardless of country of birth, while only individuals who were born in India and have a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/028-all-about-priority-dates/">priority date</a> of June 1, 2011 or earlier can proceed with their EB-2 NIW petition.</p>
<p>Please remember that the Visa Bulletin fluctuates and changes every month. Also, the EB-1A is currently eligible for premium processing on the I-140. Although there is talk to add this option to the EB-2 NIW one day, premium processing is not available for EB-2 NIW I-140s yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo, Alphabet&#8217;s self-driving arm, is building a dedicated trucking hub in Dallas and partnering with Ryder for fleet management services in a two-pronged move to seriously scale up its autonomous trucking operations across Texas, Arizona and California.</p>
<p>This news comes just a couple of months after Waymo announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/"> $2.5 billion raise</a> that it would use to continue growing its autonomous driving platform, the Waymo Driver, as well as its team. Waymo has been ramping up testing on the fifth generation of the Driver on Class 8 trucks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">hauling freight for carriers like J.B. Hunt</a> along Interstate 45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas and working with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/daimler-trucks-partners-with-waymo-to-build-self-driving-semi-trucks/"> Daimler Trucks</a> to develop a robust level 4 redundant vehicle platform, according to a spokesperson for the company. According to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/daimler-trucks-partners-with-waymo-to-build-self-driving-semi-trucks/">Society of Automotive Engineers</a>, level 4 autonomy means the vehicle can drive itself without a human but only in predefined areas.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Waymo and J.B. Hunt partner to bring autonomous trucks to Texas in new pilot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/embed/#?secret=TVnBDNwaK1" data-secret="TVnBDNwaK1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Waymo has already broken ground on the new 9-acre trucking hub, which will be built specifically for Waymo Via, the company&#8217;s autonomous trucking operations, in Dallas-Forth Worth to service one of the busiest corridors in the country. Designed for commercial use, the hub is expected to accommodate hundreds of trucks as the company scales in the region and amplifies larger and more complex autonomous testing. Waymo says it will help the company spread out operations in Texas beyond the I-45 and across the I-10 and I-20. The location is well situated to support long-haul routes across state borders and connect with Waymo&#8217;s Phoenix operations center. Waymo said it plans to move into the facility during the first half of next year.</p>
<p>This is where the Ryder partnership comes in. The Dallas hub will be a central launch point for testing not only the Waymo Driver, but also its transfer hub model, which is a mix of automated and manual trucking that optimizes transfer hubs near highways to ensure the Waymo Driver is sticking to main thoroughfares and human drivers are handling first and last mile deliveries. Scaling this model will require a high level of organization, and Ryder&#8217;s fleet management services and standardized fleet maintenance across over 500 facilities should be up to the job.</p>
<p>The partnership includes fleet maintenance, inspections and roadside assistance across all of the Waymo Via hubs and testing sites, including the new Dallas facility. Given Ryder&#8217;s size and influence and Waymo&#8217;s access to AV fleet data, the two companies will also work on a blueprint for autonomous truck maintenance and optimized performance.</p>
<p>“While this partnership initially focuses on fleet maintenance, we see many opportunities to collaborate on autonomous trucking operations in order to successfully deploy these trucks at scale,” said Karen Jones, chief marketing officer and head of new product development for Ryder, in a statement. “Already, we’ve collaborated on the layout and design of Waymo’s new Dallas facility to ensure it’s optimized for serviceability of trucks and for the transfer hub model they plan to pursue in the near future. Autonomous Class 8 technology is quickly taking hold, and Ryder is poised to become a leader — not only in servicing trucks but also in managing the unique logistics of autonomous operations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is slowly walking back its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/apple-tweaks-controversial-ios-15-safari-changes-in-latest-beta/">controversial decision</a> to redesign mobile Safari in iOS 15 to show the address bar at the bottom of the screen, floating atop the page&#8217;s content. The revamp, which was largely meant to make it easier to reach Safari&#8217;s controls with one hand, had been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios">met with criticism</a> as Apple&#8217;s other design choices actually made the new experience less usable than before. With the latest release of iOS 15 beta 6, Apple is responding to user feedback and complaints with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes">introduction</a> of yet another design that now shows the bottom tab bar below the page content, offering a more standardized experience for those who would have otherwise liked the update. More importantly, perhaps, Apple is no longer forcing the bottom tab bar on users.</p>
<p>With the new release, there&#8217;s now an option to show the address bar at the top of the page, as before. For all those who truly hated the update, this means they can set things back to &#8220;normal.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191155" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191155" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg 2778w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/safari-changes.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191155" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshots, tab bar before and after</p></div></p>
<p>One significant complaint with the floating tab bar was that it <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1418297985398624258">made some websites nearly unusable</a>, as the bar would block out elements you needed to click. (To get to these unreachable parts of the page, you&#8217;d have to swipe the bar down &#8212; a less-than-ideal experience).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In iOS 15 beta 6, these and other issues are addressed. Essentially, the tab bar looks much like it used to &#8212; with a familiar row of buttons, like it had before when it had been available at the top of the screen. And the bar will no longer get in the way of website content.</p>
<p>Testers had also pointed out that Apple&#8217;s original decision to hide often-used features &#8212; like the reload button or Reader Mode &#8212; under the three-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu made Safari more difficult to use than in the past. With the release of iOS 15 beta 4, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/apple-tweaks-controversial-ios-15-safari-changes-in-latest-beta/">Apple had tried to solve this problem</a> by bringing back the reload and share buttons, and making Reader Mode appear when available. But the buttons were still small and harder to tap than before.</p>
<p>The new tab bar and the return to normal it offers &#8212; regardless of its placement at the top or bottom of the screen &#8212; is an admission from Apple that users&#8217; complaints on this matter were, in fact, valid. And it&#8217;s a demonstration of what beta testing is meant to be about: trying out new ideas and fixing what doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Separately, beta 6 users can now restore the tab bar to the top of the page, if that&#8217;s your preference. You can now find an option under <em>Settings &#8211;&gt; Safari</em> to choose between the Tab Bar default and the Single Tab option &#8212; the latter which relocates the address bar to the top of the screen. (Doing so means you&#8217;ll lose the option to swipe through your open tabs, as you could with the Tab Bar, however.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly common for Apple to offer alternatives to its default settings &#8212; like how it allows users to configure how gestures and clicks work on the Mac&#8217;s trackpad, for example, or how it allows users to turn off the <a href="https://heresthethingblog.com/2014/07/23/mac-tip-natural-scrolling-feels/">once</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1p7gm2/who_here_actually_uses_natural_scrolling/">debated</a> &#8220;natural&#8221; scroll direction option. But adding the option to return the tab at the top is an admission that some good portion of Safari users didn&#8217;t want to relearn how to use one of the iPhone&#8217;s most frequently-accessed apps. And if forced to do so, they may have switched browsers instead.</p>
<p>As Apple typically releases the latest version of its iOS software in the fall, this update may represent one of the final changes to Safari we&#8217;ll see ahead of the public release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last time I was in Hong Kong, a startup gave me a jar of mealworms as a snack. They were crunchy and a bit odd looking (as one might expect from a jar full of baked larvae). They really didn’t offer much in the way of flavor, though, so maybe supply your own seasoning.</p>
<p>For all sorts of sustainability reasons, there’s been a good deal of interest in these sorts of alternative protein sources &#8212; for humans and otherwise. <a href="http://betahatch.com/">Beta Hatch’s</a> farming efforts are squarely focused on the latter, citing livestock and pets as primary targets for a farming process it says is “virtually zero-waste.”</p>
<p>Today the St. Louis-based firm announced $10 million in funding in a round led by Lewis &amp; Clark AgriFood, with participation from Cavallo Ventures and Innova Memphis, which are both signed on as existing investors. The money comes as Beta Hatch is eyeing the expansion of its flagship farm in Cashmere, Washington.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be a part of building the future of farming as a member of the Washington agricultural community,” founder and CEO Virginia Emery said in a release. “We are excited for our presence in rural America to grow, as we employ and partner with the people in those communities to feed a growing global population.”</p>
<p>The company says the new facility will be the largest of its kind in North America, helping to push Beta Hatch to 10x its current output over the next year. The location is currently powered by renewably sourced energy.</p>
<p>Mealworms have proven intriguing as food sources for food sources, as evidenced by Ÿnsect’s $125 million raise way back in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inaccord.com/">Accord</a> opened up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/accord-launches-b2b-sales-platform-with-6m-seed/">previously announced $6 million seed round</a> to accept over $1 million from a group of CEOs and sales leads at companies they are working with to officially launch its business-to-business sales platform.</p>
<p>Brothers Ross and Ryan Rich co-founded the San Francisco-based company in 2019 with Wayne Pan to create a customer collaboration platform that, in the words of CEO Ross Rich, “makes the process of buying and selling suck less.”</p>
<p>The average sales deal can involve 14 people, just on the buyer side, which means teams do a lot of “herding cats” in order to drive consensus on sales, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yZsP98HzN5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/accord-launches-b2b-sales-platform-with-6m-seed/">Accord launches B2B sales platform with $6M seed</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Accord launches B2B sales platform with $6M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/accord-launches-b2b-sales-platform-with-6m-seed/embed/#?secret=yZsP98HzN5" data-secret="yZsP98HzN5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instead, Accord’s application provides shared next steps and milestones for buying and selling teams to align on so that the right people are looped in at the right time.</p>
<p>“Our unique approach is helping management and sales, but also helping the buyer, which is how you build a relationship,” Ross Rich explained. “Before COVID, you could go onsite, but now you can’t do that. You also have to adjust to the buyer’s expectations, and with business-to-consumer, everything is ‘now and immediate.’ ”</p>
<p>The company’s target market is technology startups, but Ross Rich said Accord is now attracting interest from medical device companies and others where there is no software that bridges the gap between external parties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past six months, Accord doubled its team and was approached by multiple companies with acquisition offers. However, just a year-and-a-half into the company Rich said he is not entertaining those kinds of offers just yet.</p>
<p>“We have barely scratched the surface and would be selling ourselves short not having had a swing at it,” he added.</p>
<p>The company decided to focus on non-institutional investors when it raised this uncapped round, opting not to grow the board, Rich said.</p>
<p>Instead, it gathered a group of CEOs and sales leads from companies it works with — people who were getting it and seeing the value, including Mike Murchison, co-founder and CEO of Ada Support, who said via email that Ada’s B2B growth “exploded in part because of our focus on being a true partner — not simply a vendor — to our clients.” He added that Accord made it easy for Ada’s sales teams to offer a collaborative buying process.</p>
<p>Another investor, Stephanie Schatz, one of Accord’s advisors, said via email she got in on the round due to Ross Rich having “all the right ingredients for a successful founder,” and the product, which she said was taking into account how people want to buy.</p>
<p>“Ross has intelligence, drive, passion, vision and charisma, but on top of that, I have found that he has excellent instincts for leading a team and building a generational company,” she added. “Accord offers CEOs and sales leaders the opportunity to build a high-performing sales team from the very beginning that truly puts customers at the center.”</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward the general launch of the platform and adding to its team of 13. Rich expects a Series A round to quickly follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdja9m4YlT4&amp;">Pokémon Presents</a> livestream, The Pokémon Company announced that Pokémon Unite will become available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Android</a> on September 22. The strategic battle game came out for Nintendo Switch in late July, but its arrival on mobile devices will expand the game&#8217;s potential user base.</p>
<p>For users already playing on Nintendo Switch, fear not &#8212; the game allows cross-platform play, which means you can play on your Switch, then pick up where you left off on mobile. All users can play together regardless of what device they&#8217;re using, and it&#8217;s not necessary to have a Switch to get the mobile game. Pokémon Unite is free-to-start with microtransactions &#8212; you can purchase in-game currency to get certain items or Pokémon.</p>
<p>The presentation also unveiled new gameplay footage and feature news for upcoming Nintendo Switch releases: <a href="https://diamondpearl.pokemon.com/en-gb/">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> (November 19, 2021), remakes of the Nintendo DS games from 2006, and <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (January 28, 2022), the first open world RPG in the Pokémon universe.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191120" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191120" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BDSP_Screen_EN_25.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</p></div></p>
<p>Like previous main series game remakes, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will expand upon the original games&#8217; foundation and introduce features that appeared in later games, like Following Pokémon, Secret Bases, and &#8212; very importantly &#8212; changing your trainer&#8217;s outfit. The game will also include re-designed features from its original release, like designing Poké Ball capsules and competing in Pokémon Contests. But for the first time in a Pokémon Game, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will introduce a new aspect of gameplay called the Sinnoh Underground. Players can collect statues of Pokémon for their Secret Base, and depending on what statues are on display, different Pokémon will appear in Pokémon Hideaways within the Sinnoh Underground. To commemorate the fifteen-year-old games&#8217; remakes, on November 5, 2021, Nintendo will release a &#8220;Dialga and Palkia Edition&#8221; of the Nintendo Switch Lite, which features the legendary Pokémon in gold and silver on a grey console.</p>
<p>Then, the Pokémon Company shared more information about Pokémon Legends Arceus, a first-of-its-kind release for the iconic franchise. Fans have compared its open world design to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which is the fourth best-selling Nintendo Switch game with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805_3e.pdf">23.2 million copies</a> sold, but others say it&#8217;s more <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-what-youll-actually-do-in-pokemon-legends-arceus-1847097025">similar to Monster Hunter</a>. The new game introduces the Hisui Region (an ancient version of the Sinnoh Region), along with new Pokémon like a <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1427983460887633928">grandpa-esque Growlithe</a>, and an evolution of Basculin called <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1427985426166566912">Basculegion</a>, which can evolve when &#8220;possessed by the souls of other Basculin from their school that could not withstand the harsh journey upstream&#8221;&#8230; Yes, this is a children&#8217;s franchise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to the Hisui region, Trainers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Newly discovered Pokémon, newly discovered regional forms, and new gameplay features are coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsArceus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsArceus</a>! <a href="https://t.co/h08CvKToSf">pic.twitter.com/h08CvKToSf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Nightmare-inducing new Pokémon aside, the livestream revealed more information about how exactly this new type of Pokémon game will work.</p>
<p>Like standard Pokémon games, players will set out on a mission to complete a Pokédex, but rather than training to become &#8220;the best like no one ever was,&#8221; they will be part of an expedition team, conducting survey work to learn more about the nature of Pokémon and the secrets they hold. In between field assignments, players can heal their party, craft items, and buy supplies at outposts (ancient Pokémon Centers?). Pokémon Legends: Arceus will also introduce a new battle style &#8212; like Pokémon Unite, it won&#8217;t simply repurpose the turn-based gameplay we&#8217;ve been accustomed to since the first Pokémon games were released in 1998.</p>
<p>Anyway, these games seem promising, but just try your best not to think about Basculegion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia is one of the most prestigious and successful venture firms to ever exist. The firm&#8217;s portfolio includes Airbnb, 23andMe, Docker, Dropbox, Figma and GitHub &#8212; and that barely covers the first half of the alphabet. (The Sequoia website lists portfolio companies in alphabetical order.)</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we are absolutely thrilled to have <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-capital-and-rec-room?ref=cc6f33dc754d">Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Rec Room founder Nick Fajt join us on Extra Crunch Live</a> in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Rec Room is a Seattle-based startup that allows users to not only play games, but to build them collaboratively with their friends. The gaming world has seen a huge boost in the wake of the pandemic, and Rec Room is thinking way out in the future about what gaming looks like not only as a user, but as a creator.</p>
<p>The company has raised nearly $150 million, and Sequoia led Rec Room&#8217;s seed and Series A financing rounds.</p>
<p>Stephanie Zhan has been with Sequoia as part of the early-stage and seed investment team, with a portfolio that includes Sunday (outdoor home subscription service), Linear (issues tracking tool for modern developers) and Middesk (background checks for businesses). She has also helped lead investments in Graphcore (microprocessors for machine intelligence), Evervault (dev tools for data privacy) and Doppler (secrets management for developers).</p>
<p>Before joining Sequoia, Zhan held product roles at Google and Nest.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from this founder/investor duo about how they met, what made them choose each other and how they&#8217;ve worked together and tackled obstacles moving forward. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-capital-and-rec-room?ref=cc6f33dc754d">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since launch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/are-learning-pods-the-future-of-edtech-remote-learning/">‘learning pods’ have been controversial in the world of edtech.</a> The term, somewhat synonymous with micro-schools, pandemic pods, and small-group learning, describes small clusters of children within the same age range who are paired with a private instructor with the goal of replacing, or supplementing, learning.</p>
<p>The concept took off last year as working parents looked for a way to supplement their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">children’s video-based school days </a>with more engaging, personalized material. Some edtech entrepreneurs predicted that the trend would usher in a new wave of homeschooled children, which would disproportionately favor affluent families that could afford pod-learning to begin with. <a href="https://tytonpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/School-Disrupted-04.21-FINAL.pdf">Tyton Partners estimates</a> that 7 million students were enrolled in supplemental learning pods last year, which drove $12 billion in new spend.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a year after the first pods popped up, one startup coming out of Y Combinator has a fresh take on the role that the emerging learning model plays in schooling. <a href="https://www.kaipodlearning.com/">KaiPod Learning</a>, founded by the former Chief Product Officer of Pearson Online Learning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumaramar/">Amar Kumar</a>, recently launched its learning pod service that aims to connect homeschooled children with in-person, supplemental learning pods.</p>
<p>The Boston-based startup wants to be the go-to platform for online learners and learning pod families to get in-person interactions into their curriculum. The startup is starting by targeting homeschooling families in need of a boost to refresh existing curriculums.</p>
<p>KaiPod begins by helping parents pick the best online school for their child, whether it’s through <a href="https://soraschools.com/">a virtual microschool like Sora Schools</a> or a homeschooling program set up by locals. This process makes sure that students get access to a replacement from a traditional school that still meets core standards. Then, KaiPod tries to serve as a co-working space of sorts for any child that is going through the online school.</p>
<p>“We know we can&#8217;t do socialization as well in the cloud, we can’t do childcare as well in the cloud, and those are some of the things that parents look to schools for,” Kumar said. “And the fact that we got rid of them by moving everything online shows you that our priorities weren’t in the right place.”</p>
<p>Students are invited to come to a KaiPod center near them where they will interact with learning coaches, a role that Kumar defines as part-time teacher, part-tiime camp counselor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coaches are there to help through online coursework, while also leading enrichment activities meant to give the social edge back to the school day. Learning coaches are juggling a variety of curriculums within their centers, which could be a quality assurance challenge as KaiPod scales.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, KaiPod is helping students in virtual school go to physical school, but this time with more flexibility and diversity when it comes to what the day looks like. For example, one kid may be following an entirely different curriculum than another; which means the physical space won’t be used for, say, a lecture, but may be used for a socratic-style seminar that motivates children to share their separate learnings.</p>
<h2>A WeWork for education?</h2>
<p>Kumar thinks it&#8217;s a more inclusive approach to pods because it takes care of child care along with education. The centers are open five days a week from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Kumar pointed to Kumon as an example of how out of school, supplemental models can lead to academic enrichment. Kumon began as one off centers, and eventually took over the franchisee model until it became one of the largest after school tutoring companies in the global market.</p>
<p>A non-insignificant part of KaiPod’s success depends on if homeschooling is here to stay, beyond the pandemic bump of interest. The National Center for Education Statistics shows that the percent of homeschool households in the United States tripled between 2020 to 2021, but the numbers don’t entirely reflect how the return to school will change those metrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, KaiPod Learning ran an eight-student pilot program in Boston this year. Kumar said that one learning coach identified the early signs of a potential learning disability in a middle-schooler during a game, a sign he thinks illustrates how a small-group format helps instructors ‘engage with students in more ways than just didactic teaching.” KaiPod plans to open up 5 to 7 more centers in the next few months.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we generate more awareness, we think entrepreneurs in other states will want to open centers using our playbook (a la franchise model) and we can power them through our technology layer [which is] affectionately code named “<span class="il">KaiPod</span> OS”&#8221; Kumar said. The locations of centers could show who KaiPod is selling to, as well as if families come from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;At this point I have no interest in becoming WeWork for education, or anything like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Think of the centers as convenient areas where families can drop off their kids, stop in and see how the pod is doing.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ransomware is rarely out of the headlines. Just last week, IT consulting giant Accenture was hit by the LockBit ransomware gang, days after Taiwan-based laptop maker Gigabyte also fell victim to an apparent ransomware attack, leading the hackers to leak gigabytes of confidential AMD and Intel data.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, ransomware — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/">which has rocketed in activity during the pandemic</a> — remains among the most costly to businesses, with large U.S companies losing an average of $5.66 million each year to ransomware.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But new findings show that is not for the reason you might think.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ozn2wqbXBl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/">2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=ozn2wqbXBl" data-secret="ozn2wqbXBl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While we often hear of multimillion-dollar ransom payments made by hackers, <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/analyst-reports/ponemon-cost-of-phishing-study">research from Proofpoint and the Ponemon Institute</a> found that ransom payments typically account for less than 20% of the total cost of a ransomware attack. Of that $5.66 million figure each year, just $790,000 accounts for ransom payments. Rather, the research shows businesses suffer the majority of their losses through lost productivity and the time-consuming task of containing and cleaning up after a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Proofpoint says that the remediation process for an average-sized organization takes on average 32,258 hours, which when multiplied by the average $63.50 IT hourly wage totals more than $2 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Downtime and lost productivity is another costly consequence of ransomware attacks; the research shows that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> attacks, for example, which were determined as the root cause of almost one-fifth of ransomware attacks last year, have led to employee productivity losses of $3.2 million in 2021, up from $1.8 million in 2015.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“In the wake of a ransomware attack, communication and interaction between employees and any effected external parties must increase massively, causing many teams to have to drop all existing work as part of their ‘day job’ immediately and focus on this urgent matter, for potentially days, weeks or even months,” Proofpoint&#8217;s Andrew Rose told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“They automatically face more scrutiny from customers, regulators and have to increase reliance on third parties. This may include a significant increase in external audits by customers and regulators, which again increases workload cost. There’s also the potential of regulatory fines, or class action lawsuits from customers,&#8221; said Rose.</p>
<p>This isn’t all businesses have to contend with from a financial point of view; organizations hit by ransomware are also likely to face an increase in cyber insurance costs, hefty IT expenditure and likely will have to cough up for PR teams, legal staff, customer services and external specialists. There’s also the brand and reputational fallout from such attacks: <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/report-ransomware-attacks-and-the-true-cost-to-business">recent research from Cybereason</a> shows that more than half of U.S. companies reported their brand was tarnished as a result of a ransomware attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“For public organizations, there is also the potential for the share price to fall,” Rose adds. “Customers can also lose trust in a business once they know their data may have been at risk, which may in turn cause them to jump ship to a competitor, costing revenue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.webiny.com/">Webiny</a>, an early-stage startup that launched in 2019 with an open-source, serverless CMS, had also developed a framework to help build the CMS, and found that customers were also interested in that to help build their own serverless apps. Today, Webiny announced a $3.5 million seed round to continue developing both pieces.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s venture fund M12 led the round, with participation from Samsung Next, Episode 1, Cota Capital and other unnamed investors. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/webiny-announces-347k-seed-to-build-open-source-serverless-cms/">previously raised $348,000</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Webiny founder Sven Al Hamad says that when the company launched, he had an inkling that serverless would be the future and started by building an open-source serverless CMS, but then something interesting happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke to more than 300 companies, who had actually approached us and they also believed that the future is going to be built on top of serverless infrastructure. While they were intrigued by the CMS we built, they were more intrigued in terms of how we built it because they had tried serverless and they had a poor experience,&#8221; Al Hamad explained.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Webiny team was spending the vast majority of its time building an underlying serverless framework in order to build the CMS on top of that, and he began to realize that maybe they should be marketing and selling both the framework and the CMS.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was still a lot of interest for the CMS, but a lot of companies wanted both, being able to use the CMS for some of the content platforms, but also being able to build custom APIs on top, custom business logic, all on top of serverless,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0g0gToFPTB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/serverless-and-containers-two-great-technologies-that-work-great-together/">Serverless and containers: Two great technologies that work better together</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Serverless and containers: Two great technologies that work better together&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/serverless-and-containers-two-great-technologies-that-work-great-together/embed/#?secret=0g0gToFPTB" data-secret="0g0gToFPTB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At that point, Al Hamad realized that his startup had two products and that&#8217;s where they stand today as they take on this new capital to help build out the company. While he is still working on building a community and reports that he hosts a Slack community with close to a 1,000 developers, the goal is to use this money to begin building commercial products on top of their open-source offerings.</p>
<p>That will involve some sort of enterprise offering with management features for complex environments, single sign-on, better security and so forth.</p>
<p>Serverless is a way of delivering infrastructure in an automated way, so that the developer can concentrate on building the application without worrying about delivering the correct amount of resources. But it requires a very specific way of programming that involves writing functions and triggers. Webiny&#8217;s serverless framework is designed to help developers build these specialized apps and the related bits to make it all work.</p>
<p>The company currently has nine employees, with plans to add about six more over the remainder of 2021. He says that diversity is top of mind, but there are challenges in a tight market for technical talent. &#8220;We are thinking openly about diversity, but the overall market in terms of the talent available is making it very hard for us to find that balance,&#8221; he said. He says that there needs to be an effort across the entire system to train more diverse talent in STEM roles, but he will continue to try look for a diverse staff in spite of the challenges.</p>
<p>He says that his employees are spread out, but when it&#8217;s possible to be back in the office, he intends to make offices available where there are pools of people, while giving them the flexibility to decide when and if to come in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.onefinance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a startup that aims to bring “all-in-one banking” to the middle class, announced today that it has raised $40 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ive Investment Company (the insurance giant’s investment arm) led the round, which included </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participation from Obvious Ventures, Foundation Capital, Core Innovation Capital and others. The financing brings One’s total raised since its 2019 inception to $66 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since making its product generally available in September of 2020, Northern California-based One has grown to have “hundreds of thousands” of customers, according to CEO and co-founder Brian Hamilton, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who previously co-founded PushPoint (which was </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pushpoint-mobile"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by</span></a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/capital-one"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stretched middle-income households and working families deal with financial stress on a daily basis and are largely unsupported by current offerings,” Hamilton said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can be viewed as a kind of a noisy market, and so this funding has been a good validation of the vision and kind of the products, in that we have been able to stand out in that market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 11 months, the startup has worked to enhance its core product offering, launching overdraft protection, an auto-save feature that rewards automatic savings contributions at 3.00% APY, cash flow-based credit lines and a credit builder product to help its customers build financial health. One claims that it has helped its users automatically save over $2 million collectively since its launch, a number that grows daily, according to Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also trying to change up how people share financial goals and responsibilities with individually configurable “Pockets” that it says can be “easily” shared with others and accessed via virtual and physical cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re doing really is to re-integrate and unify what is otherwise a pretty splintered financial life for middle income households and families that are attempting to manage finances on a daily, weekly and monthly basis,” Hamilton told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, he said, there have been a number of different fintech and bank products that people use to run their life “and they&#8217;re all starting to converge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded on the premise that traditional banking exists &#8220;on a system of fractured accounts and billions of dollars in hidden fees that leave customers living paycheck to paycheck despite steady incomes.&#8221; One says it is built on a “proprietary” technology core that aims to deliver </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saving, spending, sharing, budgeting and borrowing in a single account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody&#8217;s trying to do a piece of everything, but they all started doing one thing,” Hamilton said. “But it&#8217;s really hard to back into the others or to bolt them on afterwards if you didn&#8217;t begin with the end in mind, kind of on an integrated basis. So that is essentially what we set out to build with One, with the idea to reunify credit and debit and savings and reintegrate the sharing of money with other people so it didn&#8217;t have to be done on a one-off transactional basis through Venmo or PayPal or Zelle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s banking services are provided by Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC. The startup emphasizes that it’s a financial technology company, and “not a bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the new funding toward “fueling” customer growth, hiring and expanding its product offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Moldow, Foundation Capital general partner and One investor, said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenger banks such as Chime and Aspiration focus on a debit card offering to subprime customers who are looking for lower bank fees and access to paychecks sooner.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These customers are generally treated poorly by banks and charged a lot of fees because they don’t generate much revenue for banks outside of interchange fees on debit purchases with little disposable income,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real money made by banks, according to Moldow, is against mid-prime customers for both debit and lending.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These customers are harder to acquire because banks hate to lose them due to their large lifetime values,” he said. “One differs from the challenger banks in the market in that they have created a superior mobile banking experience for the 80% of the market that is not super prime or subprime. They have both a debit and credit offering and a vastly better user experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech is able to offer a user experience that is “materially” different from standard large bank offerings in that their back end infrastructure is a “modern” core and One is able to handle core checking, lending, money transfer and savings all on the same back end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means One can fully integrate those experiences (the aforementioned integrated offering “Pockets”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This differs from traditional banks which have each of these systems on top of different tech stacks which prevents them from providing integrated offerings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, by not having brick and mortar branches, the company is able to offer lower fees, more points and rewards and higher savings rates, Moldow added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The Exchange. Today we&#8217;re doing something fun with crypto.</p>
<p>Sure, we could write more about how insurtech valuations are under fresh pressure after <a href="https://investors.hippo.com/news/investor-news/news-details/2021/Hippo-Raises-Full-Year-Growth-Outlook-for-Total-Generated-Premium-Q2-Results-Reflect-Strategic-Progress-to-Scale-and-Diversify/default.aspx">Hippo&#8217;s Q2 earnings report</a> &#8212; we spoke to the company&#8217;s president yesterday; more to come &#8212; or the <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/global-equity/chinese-tech-shares-drop-on-new-rules-to-prevent-data-consumer-abuse-15744083">latest stock market movements</a> in China. There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/api-platform-postman-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-225-million-fundraise/">big rounds worth considering as well</a>. Roblox <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">reported earnings this week</a>. And Monday.com&#8217;s <a href="https://ir.monday.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondaycom-announces-second-quarter-2021-results">earnings</a> pushed its shares sharply higher yesterday. There&#8217;s lots of interesting news to chew on.</p>
<p>But instead of all that, we&#8217;re digging back into crypto. Why? Because there are some rather bullish trends that indicate the world of blockchain is maturing and creating a raft of winning players</p>

<p>Writing about crypto is always a little risky. Cybersecurity folks will complain that we&#8217;re abusing the phrase <em>crypto, </em>despite the fact that language always evolves. And Bitcoin maximalists aren&#8217;t going to find much below that underscores their core thesis that every coin not mentioned in Satoshi&#8217;s whitepaper is, in fact, a scam. Save your tweets, please.</p>
<p>But if you care more generally about the larger global cryptoeconomy, it&#8217;s time to imbibe some good news. Our goal is to highlight a few recent trends and then talk a little about what we might see coming from startups.</p>

Let&#8217;s get busy.</p>
<h2>Encouraging news from your local distributed ledger</h2>
<p>The Exchange finds rising NFT volumes bullish, and we have a new thesis for what the value proposition is for such digital assets. The rising tide of mega-rounds for crypto exchanges belies not only the worldwide demand for access to crypto, but also sets the stage for a global cohort of stable, well-funded and trustworthy on-ramps to the crypto world &#8212; and, of course, more exchanges imply lower fees over time.</p>
<p>Non-exchange crypto fees are also bullish. And then there&#8217;s a wrinkle to the stablecoin game and what sort of economics things like USDC may command in time. We have notes from an interview with Circle to help us there.</p>
<h2>NFTs and the concept of joy</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone actually understands what the metaverse is. But the possibility that, in time, unique assets on particular chains &#8212; NFTs &#8212; will have a part to play in larger digital worlds seems like a reasonable conjecture. One can easily imagine life, as we all become Increasingly Online, leaning on human desires for scarcity as a method of showing status. NFTs will help meet that demand in certain digital ecosystems. Games, probably, though what we consider a game will also evolve as VR becomes more mainstream.</p>
<p>But that future is not here yet. So, what value are NFTs providing <em>today</em> that makes them potentially worthwhile? Joy.</p>

<p>Holoride’s VR gaming system for passengers caught our attention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">a few years back at CES</a> when we were given a ride in an Audi on a track and had the game react to the movement of the vehicle while we played. Well, the company is back and this time they demoed two games and threw off the shackles of the track for the real world.</p>
<p>We took a ride in an Audi with the Holoride system and again enjoyed video games while someone else drove. The company is currently courting developers to build games via their recently announced SDK and are partnering with automakers to make sure that the data they need from the car to make their games a reality is available. Watch the video above for the full story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Floods are devastating. They rip asunder communities, wipe out neighborhoods, force the evacuation of thousands of people every year and recovering from them can take years — assuming recovery is possible at all. <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/summary-stats">The U.S. government estimates</a> that floods in recent decades (exclusive of hurricanes and tropical storms) have caused an estimated $160 billion in damage and killed hundreds of people.</p>
<p>One would think that we should have a real-time model for where water is and where it is going around the world, what with all of those sensors on the ground and satellites in orbit. But we mostly don’t, instead relying on antiquated models that fail to take into account the possibilities of big data and big compute.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.floodmapp.com">FloodMapp</a>, a Brisbane, Australia-based startup, is aiming to wash out the old approaches to hydrology and predictive analytics and put in place a much more modern approach to help emergency managers and citizens know when the floods are coming — and what to do.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Juliette Murphy has spent a lifetime in the water resources engineering field, and saw firsthand the heavy destruction that water can cause. In 2011, she watched as her friend’s home was submerged in the midst of terrible flooding. The “water went right over the peak of her house,” she said. Two years later in Calgary, she saw the same situation again: floods and fear as friends tried to determine whether and how to evacuate.</p>
<p>Those memories and her own professional career led her to think more about how to build better tools for disaster managers. She ultimately synced up with CTO and co-founder Ryan Prosser to build FloodMapp in 2018, raising $1.3 million AUD along with a matching grant.</p>
<p>The company’s premise is simple: We have the tools to build real-time flooding models today, but we just have chosen not to take advantage of them. Water follows gravity, which means that if you know the topology of a place, you can predict where the water will flow to. The challenge has been that calculating second-order differential equations at high resolution remains computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Murphy and Prosser decided to eschew the traditional physics-based approach that has been popular in hydrology for decades for a completely data-based approach that takes advantage of widely available techniques in machine learning to make those calculations much more palatable. “We do top down what used to be bottoms up,” Murphy said. “We have really sort of broken the speed barrier.” That work led to the creation of <a href="https://www.floodmapp.com/dash">DASH</a>, the startup’s real-time flood model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2191072" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191072" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191072" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brisbane-2011.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191072" class="wp-caption-text">FloodMapp&#8217;s modeling of the river flooding in Brisbane. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> FloodMapp</p></div></p>
<p>Unlike typical tech startups though, FloodMapp isn’t looking to be its own independent platform. Instead, it interoperates with existing geographic information systems (GIS) like ESRI’s ArcGIS by offering a data layer that can be combined with other data streams to provide situational awareness to emergency response and recovery personnel. Customers pay a subscription fee for access to FloodMapp’s data layer, and so far, the company is working with the <a href="https://www.floodmapp.com/post/floodmapp-nowcast-provides-flood-modelling-in-real-time">Queensland Fire and Emergency Services</a> in Australia as well as the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach in Virginia.</p>
<p>But it’s not just emergency services the startup is ultimately hoping to attract. Any company with physical assets, from telcos and power companies to banks and retail chains with physical stores could potentially be a customer of the product. In fact, FloodMapp is betting that the SEC will <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures">mandate further climate change financial disclosures</a>, which could lead to a … flood of new business (I get <i>one</i> flood pun, okay, I get one).</p>

<p>Murphy notes that “we are still in our early stages” and that the company is likely to raise further financing early next year as it gets through this year’s flood season and onboards several new customers. She hopes that ultimately, FloodMapp will “not only help people, but help our country change and adapt in the face of a changing climate.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/spotify-introduces-a-new-music-and-spoken-word-format-open-to-all-creators/">introduced</a> a new format that combined spoken word commentary with music, allowing creators to reproduce the radio-like experience of listening to a DJ or music journalist who shared their perspective on the tracks they would then play. Today, the company is making the format, which it calls &#8220;Music + Talk,&#8221; available to global creators through its podcasting software Anchor.</p>
<p>Creators who want to offer this sort of blended audio experience can now do so by using the new &#8220;Music&#8221; tool in Anchor, which provides access to Spotify&#8217;s full catalog of 70 million tracks that they can insert into their spoken-word audio programs. Spotify has said this new type of show will continue to compensate the artist when the track is streamed, the same as it would elsewhere on Spotify&#8217;s platform. In addition, users can also interact with the music content within the shows as they would otherwise &#8212; by liking the song, viewing more information about the track, saving the song, or sharing it, for example.</p>

<p>The shows themselves, meanwhile, will be available to both free and Premium Spotify listeners. Paying subscribers will hear the full tracks when listening to these shows, but free users will only hear a 30-second preview of the songs, due to licensing rights.</p>
<p>The format is somewhat reminiscent of Pandora’s Stories, which was also a combination of music and podcasting,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/pandora-stories-launches-combining-music-and-podcasting-in-a-new-format/"> introduced in 2019</a>. However, in Pandora&#8217;s case, the focus had been on allowing artists to add their own commentary to music &#8212; like talking about the inspiration for a song &#8212; while Spotify is making it possible for anyone to annotate their favorite playlists with audio commentary.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aFhj3NqheJ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Since launching last year, the product has been tweaked somewhat in response to user feedback, Spotify says. The shows now offer clearer visual distinction between the music and talk segments during an episode, and they include music previews on episode pages. To date, creators have produced &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of shows using the format, Spotify told TechCrunch, but the company isn&#8217;t providing exact numbers at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ability to create Music + Talk shows was previously available in select markets ahead of this global rollout, including in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>With the expansion, creators in a number of other major markets are now gaining access, including Japan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Colombia. Alongside the expansion, Spotify&#8217;s catalog of Music + Talk original programs will also grow today, as new shows from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, India, Japan and the Philippines will be added.</p>
<p>Spotify will also begin to more heavily market the feature with the launch of its own Spotify Original called &#8220;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0NdI3QfPXutB8oqZENmpJN">Music + Talk: Unlocked</a>,&#8221; which will offer tips and ideas for creators interested in trying out the format.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blumira.com/">Blumira</a> today announced it raised a $10.3 million Series A financing round. The Ann Arbor-based cybersecurity company says the capital will be used to expand its product offering, double its headcount to 80 employees, and grow its partnership program with managed service providers.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2018, seeks to provide enterprise-level security to medium-sized businesses through turn-key, cloud-based solutions. Blumira’s solution upends the traditional security information and event management market with a powerful suite of tools designed specifically for mid-market companies that’s relatively more affordable. According to Blumira, its product deploys quickly and gives these companies the security and threat monitoring ability of tools used by giant corporations.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the firm has raised $12.9 million since its founding in 2018. New investor Mercury led Blumira’s Series A with Managing Director Aziz Gilani joining Blumira’s board as a director. The Series A also included participation from Ten Eleven Ventures, enterprise angles, and existing investors of M25, Array Ventures, and Duo<br />
Security co-founder and angel investor Jon Oberheide.</p>
<p>“Having additional capital behind us accelerates our velocity and ability to execute our vision of democratizing the detection and response market,” said Steve Fuller, co-founder and CEO at Blumira. “We’ve built incredible momentum in just a few short years, and we’re thrilled to have the support of world-class investors as we work to make security operations simple, automated, affordable and accessible to organizations of all sizes.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its technology automates how distributors and manufacturers create, execute and track rebates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://enable.com/">Enable</a>, a startup developing a cloud-based software tool for business-to-business rebate management, announced Wednesday a $45 million Series B funding round.</p>
<p>The round is led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from existing investors Menlo Ventures and Sierra Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Including the new round, the company has raised a total of $62 million, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/">$13 million Series A</a> raised in 2020.</p>
<p>The company, which started in the U.K. and moved to San Francisco in 2020, was co-founded by Andrew Butt and Denys Shortt in 2015 but launched fully in 2016. Its technology automates how distributors and manufacturers create, execute and track rebates. These types of trading programs are a common industry practice and are relied on by distributors as a way to turn a profit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2nmmX21dgS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/">Enable raises $13M to help distributors, manufacturers and retailers manage rebates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enable raises $13M to help distributors, manufacturers and retailers manage rebates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/embed/#?secret=2nmmX21dgS" data-secret="2nmmX21dgS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since raising its Series A last year, Butt, chief executive officer, moved to the Bay Area, grew its North American operations to 60 people, tripled revenue and more than tripled its customer base, he told TechCrunch. The new funding will be used for product innovation and building sales and go-to-market teams.</p>
<p>“The Series A was proving traction in the U.S. and Canada and gave us the ability to hire a U.S. leadership team,” he added. “When we saw that momentum, the market size was large and the opportunity was now getting bigger and bigger, we started scaling up the business.”</p>
<p>As customer needs changed and incentives were growing in terms of revenue and profitability, Enable saw that they were more critical to manage; the incentives needed to be more dynamic and easy to make targeted and personalized. In a sense, incentives have “gone from being blunt instruments to very sharp in size and volume,” Butt said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reaching the year over year revenue doubling was a milestone for the company, and his immediate next steps are to get a fully ramped team so Enable can continue on that growth trajectory. The market for incentives is big, but “there is no credible competition,” so the company is also working to build that distribution and sales team now, he added.</p>
<p>It was also over the past year that Butt met Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, who, as part of the investment, joined Enable’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Jacobsohn had noticed Enable and asked for an introduction to the company when it hired Jerry Brooner as its president of global field operations. Jacobsohn was tracking Brooner’s next moves after leaving Scout, a Workday company, and the hire got his attention.</p>
<p>Enable checks all of the boxes Jacobsohn said he looks for in a company: strong CEO, a good team and good customer feedback — many of them were dissatisfied with the legacy software, he said.</p>
<p>“I also love companies going after a big market where there is no credible competition,” Jacobsohn added. “There is a lot of greenfield space here. What’s great about a player like that is they can come in, create a category and be the new generation cloud player. This isn’t something someone can wake up and start. You need deep domain expertise.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rapid Robotics announced a $12 million Series A all the way back in April 2021. Four months later, the Bay Area-based robotic manufacturing firm is back with a $36.7 million Series B, led by Kleiner Perkins and Tiger Global. The round, which also features existing investors NEA, Greycroft, Bee Partners and 468 Capital, brings the company’s total funding up to $54.2 million.</p>
<p>The funding values the startup at $192.5 million &#8212; an impressive figure for a firm that was raising its seed in 2020. The Series B is Rapid’s third (!) in less than a year, no doubt spurred on by the immense interest in robotics and automation being fueled by a seemingly endless global pandemic.</p>
<p>As companies look for alternatives to “non-essential” workers, investments in these technologies have only accelerated. Manufacturing bottlenecks throughout the pandemic have also brought into sharp focus the need for flexible and global production.</p>
<p>Rapid’s value prop is a Rapid Machine Operator (RMO) robot that can be deployed in a manufacturing setting in a matter of hours, without the need for programming and other robotics knowledge. The system is available under the RaaS (robotics as a service) model for $25,000 a year. The system is flexible and can be assigned various tasks &#8212; a nice feature for companies that can’t afford devoted systems.</p>
<p>“We hear a lot about the semiconductor shortage, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Contract manufacturers can’t produce gaskets, vials, labels — you name it,” CEO Jordan Kretchmer said in a release tied to the news. “I’ve seen cases where the inability to produce a single piece of U-shaped black plastic brought an entire auto line to a halt.”</p>
<p>Automotive is a target for Rapid, though the company notes that Bay Area-based health company TruePill is now employing its systems to fill and label prescription bottles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No code platforms have developed into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">a hot market</a>, and <a href="https://www.stackerhq.com/">Stacker</a>, a London-based no-code platform is attempting to bring the concept to a new level. Not only can you create a web application from a spreadsheet, you can pull data from a variety of sources to create a sophisticated business application automatically (although some tweaking may be required).</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $20 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from existing investors Initialized Capital, Y Combinator and Pentech. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $23 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Michael Skelly, CEO and co-founder at Stacker, says that the idea is to take key business data and turn it into a useful app to help someone do their job more efficiently. &#8220;[We enable] people in business to create apps to help them in their working life &#8212; so things like customer portals, internal tools and things that take the data they&#8217;re already using, often to run a process, and turn that into an app,&#8221; Skelly explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really think that in order to actually be useful for business, you need to be hooked into the data that a business cares about. And so we let people bring their spreadsheets, SQL databases, Salesforce data, bring all the data that they use to run their business, and automatically turn it into an app,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once the company pulls that data in and creates an app, the user can begin to tweak how things look, but Stacker gives them a big head start toward creating something usable from the get-go, Skelly said.</p>
<p>Jennifer Li,  a partner at lead investor Andreessen Horowitz likes the startup&#8217;s approach to no code. &#8220;We’ve been watching the no-code space for a while, and Stacker stands apart from the rest because of its thoughtful product approach, allowing business operators to instantly generate a functional app that perfectly fits existing business processes,&#8221; she said <a href="https://blog.stackerhq.com/p/f41934f3-5795-4e00-9eec-d69d3c52ee8d/">in a blog post</a> announcing the funding round.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=8pkYih1eHz" data-secret="8pkYih1eHz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company currently has 19 employees with plans to put the new capital to work to reach 30-40 by the end of the year. Skelly sees building a diverse company as a key goal and is proactive and thoughtful about finding ways to achieve that. In fact, he has identified three ways to approach diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly is just making sure that we get a diverse pipeline of people. I really think that the ratio of the people you talk to is probably going to be the biggest indicator of the people you hire. Secondly we try to find ways we can hire people who are maybe further down their career profile, but [looking] to grow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and I think this is something that is not talked about enough, there are plenty of people who would like to get into programming roles, and who are under represented, and so we have members of our team who are converting from various non-technical roles to DevOps &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s just like a really great route to add to the overall pool [of diverse candidates],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is remote first with Skelly in London and his co-founder based in Geneva and they intend to stay that way. They founded the company in 2017 and originally created a different product that was much more complex and required a lot of hand holding before eventually concluding that making it simple was the way to go, They released the first version of the current product at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>The company has a big vision to be the software development tool for business units. &#8220;We really think that in the future just like everyone&#8217;s got email, a chat tool, a spreadsheet and a video conferencing tool nowadays, they will also have a software tool, where they write and run the custom software that they run their business on,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/additional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation">a statement</a>, T-Mobile, which has more than 100 million customers, said its preliminary analysis shows 7.8 million current postpaid T-Mobile customers had information taken in the data breach. The carrier said that some personal data on current and former postpaid was also taken, including customer names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license information for a &#8220;subset&#8221; of current and former postpay customers and prospective T-Mobile customers.</p>
<p>The company also said that 40 million records of former and prospective customers was taken, but that &#8220;no phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the company warned that approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile customer names, phone numbers, and account PINs were in fact compromised, and that customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were exposed. T-Mobile said it&#8217;s reset those customer PINs. T-Mobile said it was &#8220;recommending all postpaid customers&#8221; to proactively change their account PIN, which protects their accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/30/someone-hacked-jack-dorseys-own-twitter-account/">from SIM-swapping attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Vice reported <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">this weekend</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a possible hack after a seller on a known criminal forum claimed to be in possession of millions of records. The seller told Vice that they had 100 million records on T-Mobile customers, which included customer account names, phone numbers, and the IMEI numbers of phones on the account.</p>
<p>T-Mobile warned that there could be more fallout to come, noting that it confirmed there was &#8220;some additional information from inactive prepaid accounts accessed through prepaid billing files,&#8221; but did not say what, only that it was not financial information.</p>
<p>This is the fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years, following incidents as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/03/t-mobile-call-records-data-breach/">recently as January</a> and other incidents <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">dating back to 2018</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
