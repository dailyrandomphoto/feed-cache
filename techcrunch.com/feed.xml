										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gong.io/">Gong</a>, the revenue intelligence startup, has been raising capital at a rapid pace, and today the company announced another $250 million on a $7.25 billion valuation, a number that triples its previous valuation from last summer.</p>
<p>Franklin Templeton led today&#8217;s festivities with participation from Coatue, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital and Tiger Global. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/">raised $200 million last August</a> at a $2.2 billion valuation, and has now raised $584 million, $450 million coming in the last year.</p>
<p>What is making investors open their wallets and pull out such large sums of cash? The company is helping solve a hard problem on how to bring more intelligence to the revenue process. They do this by using artificial intelligence to listen to every customer interaction, whether that&#8217;s a sales or service call (or anything else), and use that information to determine valuable information like who is most likely to buy and who is most likely to churn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s been going well and CEO Amit Bendov says the company&#8217;s performance really validates the valuation. While he wasn&#8217;t ready to discuss specific numbers, he did say that ARR grew 2.3x between Q1 last year and this year, and he says Q2 is on pace to triple ARR.</p>
<p>&#8220;The valuation is up about 3x from last summer, but sales are more than 3x. We have high logo customers. [Last year], it was still unclear how COVID was going to impact us. People believed [our business] was going to do well [during the pandemic], but it wasn&#8217;t as obvious. Now, it is obvious. And all the [&#8230;] financials are way better, so from a pure financials [perspective] our multipliers are pretty reasonable for our revenue trajectory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With all this growth, the company is adding employees at a rapid pace. It closed the year with 400 people, and is up to around 550 today with a goal of reaching 950 by year end. It has partnered with a consulting firm called <a href="https://www.thereadyset.co/">ReadySet</a>, which helps companies build diverse and inclusive organizations, and Bendov says they are an equal pay company.</p>
<p>Women represent around 40% of the employees and around 4% are Black, a number he hopes to increase by growing the Atlanta office. In the office in Israel, he has set up employment and training programs to build bridges to the Arab community.</p>
<p>Bendov says he looks forward to meeting his U.S. employees in the coming weeks when he&#8217;ll be visiting the Atlanta office for the first time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joor, an online marketplace that connects fashion brands and retailers around the world, has opened its first China office in downtown Shanghai as it eyes growth in the region.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old New York-based company works as a virtual showroom for brands, which traditionally would meet with their retail partners in physical venues to showcase the latest collections. With Joor, showrooms become live videos, a feature that has no doubt proven useful during COVID-19.</p>
<p>The company also gives brands a set of data tools to analyze their sales that can inform future productions. For buyers, the benefits are similar &#8212; they are able to see which brand or product is trending and make better forecasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion into China follows a robust year for Joor in APAC and the opening of its offices in Melbourne and Tokyo. Joor&#8217;s wholesale volume ordered by retailers in the region grew 139% year-over-year in 2021, and wholesale volume for APAC-based brands was up 419%, the company said in an announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The establishment of JOOR Shanghai will allow us to provide frictionless wholesale management to the range of fine brands and retailers across the country,&#8221; said Joor&#8217;s CEO Kristin Savilia in a statement. &#8220;It builds on our existing leadership position in North America and Europe, and we expect continued expansion across the Asia-Pacific region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joor&#8217;s marketplace boasts more than 12,500 brands and over 325,000 retailers around the world to date. The company has raised over $35 million in funding, according to its disclosed rounds. Its investors include venture capital firms Battery Ventures and Canaan Partners as well as the 71-year-old Japanese trading house Itochu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low Earth orbit is full of stuff: not only bits of debris and junk, but also satellites — the number of which is growing rapidly alongside the decreasing cost of launch. This can occasionally pose a problem for satellite providers, whose valuable spacecraft run the risk of colliding with other satellites, or with the many thousands of other objects in orbit.</p>
<p>For most of the space age, debris tracking was performed by a smattering of military outfits and other governmental organizations, but that hardly paints a complete and broadly accessible picture. <a href="https://www.leolabs.space/">LeoLabs</a> has been aiming to fill what it calls this “data deficit” in orbital object tracking since the company’s founding in 2016. Now it will be scaling its operations with a $65 million Series B financing round, jointly led by Insight Partners and Velvet Sea Ventures. This latest round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to over $100 million.</p>
<p>LeoLabs uses ground-based phased array radars – one in Alaska, one in Texas, two in New Zealand and two in Costa Rica – to monitor low Earth orbit, and to track and measure any object that flies through its observational area. One main advantage of LeoLabs’ tracking system is the size of the objects it can detect: as small as 2 centimeters across, as opposed to the much larger 10 centimeter objects tracked by legacy detection systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2160504" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160504" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160504" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg 1711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160504" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://leolabs.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeoLabs <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The difference in scale is huge: there are around 17,000 objects in orbit 10 centimeters or larger, but that number jumps to 250,000 when monitoring from 2 centimeters. That’s a lot of opportunity for collision, and though 2 centimeters sounds small (that&#8217;s less than an inch), they can do catastrophic damage traveling at orbital velocity. Customers can access this information using a subscription service, which will automatically alert them about collision risks.</p>
<p>“There just isn&#8217;t much information about what&#8217;s going on,” Dan Ceperley told TechCrunch. “So we&#8217;re rolling out this global radar network to generate a lot of data, and then all that software infrastructure to make it useful.”</p>
<p>LeoLabs sees around three to five close approaches involving larger objects, Ceperley said per year. Those are noteworthy because a collision could potentially produce thousands of smaller fragments – even more space junk. When tracking smaller objects, the company sees up to 20 times more collision risks. Fortunately, many satellites have electric thrusters that can be activated to avoid collisions or maintain orbit. With sufficient advance, companies can maneuver a few days prior to the anticipated collision.</p>
<p>With this new injection of funds, Ceperley said the company is looking to expand the number of radar sites around the world and scale its software-as-a-service business. While LeoLabs already has complete orbital coverage, more radars will increase the frequency with which objects are tracked, he explained. LeoLabs will also be scaling its software and data science teams (already the largest in the company), setting up locations outside the U.S., and adding new products and services.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a once in a lifetime revolution going on in the space industry, all this new investment has driven down the costs of launching satellites, building satellites and operating satellites, so there’s a lot of satellites going into low Earth orbit,” Ceperley said. “There’s a need for a new generation of services to actually track all these things [. . .] And so we&#8217;re building out that next generation tracking service, mapping service, for that new era.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that is out to ease the pain of millions of employees leaving the comfy confines of their homes and losing the convenience of conducting meetings in nice tops and sweatpants has just raised new funding to help it advance on its goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based </span><a href="https://www.newstand.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by </span><a href="https://bpy.brookfield.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Property Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the largest commercial real estate owners in the United States. Existing backers Maywic, Fantail Ventures and Raga Partners also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total raised to just over $56 million since its 2015 inception.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand is a clever take on the “newsstand” concept. The startup has built a modern-looking smart vending physical product that can be set up in all sorts of different spots –– from office lobbies to floors of companies within an office building to hotels to college campuses to airports. The company’s first location was at the Union Square subway station in New York City. Over time, New Stand has combined that physical presence with an app that is designed to give people convenience in getting basics (think snacks, books and personal care items such as umbrellas or pain relievers, for example) as well as access to “location-based media.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, it wants to partner with companies to offer its platform as a way to communicate internal news in a more fun and engaging manner. The company is making a big push in the office vertical with the launch of its </span><a href="http://www.work.newstand.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand at Work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a workplace amenity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s not entirely surprising that Brookfield, one of the biggest commercial landlords in the country, would want to back a company that aims to make tenants and their employees happier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with co-founder and CEO Andrew Deitchman about the new raise and plans for the capital. He earnestly describes New Stand as a “day improvement company” that aims to make people’s days easier and more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we do it by making sure we have basic stuff that people need, but also curating things that we think they would like,” he said. “We have little shops or touch points that are like convenience stores, and we combine that with an app that introduces people to content, and also allows them to interact in other ways to accumulate points and rewards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So what New Stand really is building is a media and technology company, using convenience points as a means of accessing people&#8217;s lives and making their days a little bit better,” Deitchman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand is working to evolve from being primarily a consumer business to an enterprise one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can take care of basic needs but also engage people in a deeper relationship,” Deitchman said. “If you&#8217;re an employer who wants to relate to an employee or if you are a landlord who wants to relate better to your tenants, we can help make that happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use its new capital primarily toward expanding into new spaces, office and otherwise. Currently, it’s in about 20 locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also planning to create “new engaging services and formats” and “grow and densify its distribution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with its investment, Brookfield Properties said it plans to “further activate” its properties in New York and, ultimately beyond, with New Stand’s offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Brown, managing partner and head of the U.S. office in Brookfield&#8217;s Real Estate group, notes that prior to this investment, Brookfield had already partnered with New Stand at its flagship property, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Place New York &#8212; both as an amenity for its tenants and as an offering in its own office space for employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On both fronts, New Stand has provided an elevated experience with tangible benefits,” he told TechCrunch. “As one of the largest &#8212; if not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest &#8212; commercial real estate owners in the country and world, we have a particular interest in investing in enterprises we ourselves use, see the value in, and can help scale over time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the combination of New Stand’s physical assets and media platform has given Brookfield the opportunity to boost engagement with its tenants’ employees as well as its own, something “all landlords are trying to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helping the world’s leading companies attract, retain and motivate their workforces has long been job one for us, and that has only intensified today as firms increasingly look for ways to have the office compete with the home,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.NUE.Life">NUE Life Health</a>, a telemedine startup in the USA, is developing what it describes as a “next-generation mental wellness solution” employing treatments such as psychedelic-assisted therapies, combined with a graph database-driven app.</p>
<p>The Miami-based startup has raised a $3.3m Seed round from investors including Jack Abraham (Atomic Ventures, Hims), Shervin Pishevar (Shervin Pishevar (formerly of Sherpa Ventures, UBER), Martin Varsavsky (Prelude Fertility, Overture), and Jon Oringer (Shutterstock, Pareto Holdings), James Bailey (a capstone supporter of the Multidisciplinary Assoc. for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)) and Christina Getty. All the above are part of the recent diaspora from Silicon Valley to Miami.</p>
<p>NUE Life Health is currently operating in California, Texas, and Florida, with plans for expansion across the United States. The platform will offer at-home ketamine therapy, considered the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/behind-the-buzz-how-ketamine-changes-the-depressed-patients-brain/">fastest-acting</a> anti-depressant in the market, combined with music therapies and a data-led approach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NUE Life says research from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and Imperial College in London on MDMA and psilocybin assisted psychotherapy appears to indicate that these are “safe alternatives” in treating mental illness.</p>
<p>Juan Pablo Cappello, NUE Life’s CEO said: “We view ketamine therapy and psychedelic therapy simply as catalysts for change.  While helping patients reset is important, we at NUE Life are committed to helping our members find community and connection through our digital platform well after the effects of any psychedelic therapies have faded.”</p>
<p>NUE Life’s digital platform will leverage “Knowledge Graphs and AI to deliver personalized evidence-based therapies that approach patient care in a holistic manner,” said Demian Bellumio, co-founder and CTO of NUE Life Health. Its enterprise HIPPA-compliant health platform plans to launch in the late summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Christina Getty a co-founder and investor in NUE Life Health said: “With one of five women in the United States relying on an antidepressant to get through the day, and with our losing 22 veterans a day to suicide, we felt compelled to launch a different kind of mental wellness company.”</p>
<p>NUE Life comes as players in psychedelic medicine such as MindMed and ATAI are going public.</p>
<p>Bellumio added: “The mental wellness platform leverages Knowledge Graphs and AI to deliver personalized evidence-based therapies that approach patient care in a holistic manner.  Our platform also rigorously measures outcomes and improves over time,”</p>
<p>He said the platform creates a detailed “knowledge graph” of the patient. This allows it to understand everything about them in order to diagnose and treat their mental health condition, using an approach called integrated psychiatry. AI algorithms are then deployed to personalize recommendations, from what treatments use, what supplements to take, and what music to listen to during therapy. A proprietary music streaming service will be part of the offering.</p>
<p>Bellumio formerly worked on graph databases while at Accenture (where he ran the Knowledge Graph Center of Excellence for 2 years) and at NEORIS. The approach is also employed by United Healthcare, user its “<a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/connected-healthcare-data-challenges-graphconnect/">Connected Healthcare</a>” platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have asked tech giants to continue reporting on efforts to combat the spread of vaccine disinformation on their platforms for a further six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The continuation of the monitoring programme is necessary as the vaccination campaigns throughout the EU is proceeding with a steady and increasing pace, and the upcoming months will be decisive to reach a high level of vaccination in Member States. It is key that in this important period vaccine hesitancy is not fuelled by harmful disinformation,&#8221; the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/reports-april-actions-and-continuation-monitoring-programme-fighting-covid-19-disinformation">Commission</a> writes today.</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok and Twitter are signed up to make monthly reports as a result of being participants in the bloc&#8217;s (non-legally binding) Code of Practice on Disinformation &#8212; although, going forward, they&#8217;ll be switching to bi-monthly reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Publishing the latest batch of platform <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/reports-april-actions-and-continuation-monitoring-programme-fighting-covid-19-disinformation">reports for April</a>, the Commission said the tech giants have shown they&#8217;re unable to police &#8220;dangerous lies&#8221; by themselves &#8212; while continuing to express dissatisfaction at the quality and granularity of the data that is being (voluntarily) provided by platforms vis-a-via how they&#8217;re combating online disinformation generally.</p>
<p>“These reports show how important it is to be able to effectively monitor the measures put in place by the platforms to reduce disinformation,&#8221; said Věra Jourová, the EU&#8217;s VP for values and transparency, in a statement. &#8220;We decided to extend this programme, because the amount of dangerous lies continues to flood our information space and because it will inform the creation of the new generation Code against disinformation. We need a robust monitoring programme, and clearer indicators to measure impact of actions taken by platforms. They simply cannot police themselves alone.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">Last month</a> the Commission announced a plan to beef up the voluntary Code, saying also that it wants more players &#8212; especially from the adtech ecosystem &#8212; to sign up to help de-monitize harmful nonsense.</p>
<p>The Code of Practice initiative pre-dates the pandemic, kicking off in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/"> 2018</a> when concerns about the impact of &#8216;fake news&#8217; on democratic processes and public debate were riding high in the wake of major political disinformation scandals. But the COVID-19 public health crisis accelerated concern over the issue of dangerous nonsense being amplified online, bringing it into sharper focus for lawmakers.</p>
<p>In the EU, lawmakers are still not planning to put regional regulation of online disinformation on a legal footing, preferring to continue with a voluntary &#8212; and what the Commission refers to as &#8216;co-regulatory&#8217; &#8212; approach which encourages action and engagement from platforms vis-a-vis potentially harmful (but not illegal) content, such as offering tools for users to report problems and appeal takedowns, but without the threat of direct legal sanctions if they fail to live up to their promises.</p>
<p>It will have a new lever to ratchet up pressure on platforms too, though, in the form of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The regulation &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed at the end of last year </a> &#8212; will set rules for how platforms must handle illegal content. But commissioners have suggested that those platforms which engage positively with the EU&#8217;s disinformation Code are likely to be looked upon more favorably by the regulators that will be overseeing DSA compliance.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In another statement today, Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the EU&#8217;s Internal Market, suggested the combination of the DSA and the beefed up Code will open up &#8220;a new chapter in countering disinformation in the EU&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>“At this crucial phase of the vaccination campaign, I expect platforms to step up their efforts and deliver the strengthened Code of Practice as soon possible, in line with our Guidance,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Disinformation remains a tricky topic for regulators, given that the value of online content can be highly subjective and any centralized order to remove information &#8212; no matter how stupid or ridiculous the content in question might be &#8212; risks a charge of censorship.</p>
<p>Removal of COVID-19-related disinformation is certainly less controversial, given clear risks to public health (such as from anti-vaccination messaging or the sale of defective PPE). But even here the Commission seems most keen to promote pro-speech measures being taken by platforms &#8212; such as to promote vaccine positive messaging and surface authoritative sources of information &#8212; noting in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_2843">press release</a> how Facebook, for example, launched vaccine profile picture frames to encourage people to get vaccinated, and that Twitter introduced prompts appearing on users&#8217; home timeline during World Immunisation Week in 16 countries, and held conversations on vaccines that received 5 million impressions.</p>
<p>In the April reports by the two companies there is more detail on actual removals carried out too.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, says it removed 47,000 pieces of content in the EU for violating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies, which the Commission notes is a slight decrease from the previous month.</p>
<p>While Twitter reported challenging 2,779 accounts, suspending 260 and removing 5,091 pieces of content globally on the COVID-19 disinformation topic in the month of April.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, reported taking action against 10,549 URLs on AdSense, which the Commission notes as a &#8220;significant increase&#8221; vs March (+1378).</p>
<p>But is that increase good news or bad? Increased removals of dodgy COVID-19 ads might signify better enforcement by Google &#8212; or major growth of the COVID-19 disinformation problem on its ad network.</p>
<p>The ongoing problem for the regulators who are trying to tread a fuzzy line on online disinformation is how to quantify any of these tech giants&#8217; actions &#8212; and truly understand their efficacy or impact &#8212; without having standardized reporting requirements and full access to platform data.</p>
<p>For that, regulation would be needed, not selective self-reporting.</p>

<p><a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/">One Concern</a>, which builds a platform to model and simulate community resilience and response to earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, announced this morning that it has raised $45 million from SOMPO Holdings, the venture wing of Japan’s SOMPO, one of the country’s largest insurers. The investment is part of a total $100 million, multi-year deal that will plug One Concern’s platform into the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Japan has been something of a gem in One Concern’s market development the past few years. The startup hired Hitoshi Akimoto as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-concern-hires-cfo-cpo-and-japan-country-manager-300974286.html">country manager for Japan in late 2019</a> before <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/about/updates/one-concern-formally-expands-into-japan/">formally announcing</a> that it was expanding to Japan in February 2020. In August last year, it <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/about/updates/one-concern-forms-strategic-partnership-with-sompo-for-resilience-solutions-in-japan/">announced a strategic partnership with SOMPO</a>, and the insurer’s venture wing invested $15 million. Today’s deal expands that partnership further.</p>
<p>According to its press release, One Concern will sell its platform to six or more Japanese cities as part of the tie-up.</p>
<p>Previously, One Concern had raised three rounds of capital <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneconcern">according to Crunchbase</a> and SEC filings: a seed round in October 2015, a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001744497/000114036118032276/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">$33 million Series A round</a> led by NEA in 2017, and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744497/000156761919022632/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">a $37 million round also co-led by NEA</a>. The company was founded in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">United Airlines is the first official U.S. customer for Boom Supersonic, a company focused on making supersonic commercial flight a reality once again. Boom unveiled its supersonic sub-scale testing aircraft last year, and intends to start producing its Overture full-scale commercial supersonic passenger jet beginning in 2025, with a planned 2029 date for the beginning of commercial service after a few years of flight testing, design refinement and qualification.</p>
<p>United agreed to purchase 15 of the Overture aircraft, provided they meet United&#8217;s &#8220;safety, operating and sustainability requirements,&#8221; and the agreement also includes an option for the airline to purchase an additional 35 after that. United is obviously interested in the benefits of supersonic flight, which aims to reduce travel times by half, but it&#8217;s also looking to boost its sustainability profile with this deal with Boom.</p>
<p>Boom&#8217;s goal is to be the first commercial aircraft that runs on net-zero carbon footprint fuel right from day one. The company is focused on sourcing and using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, and part of the arrangement between the two companies includes United working in collaboration with the startup to develop and improve production sources for that sustainable fuel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>U.S. airlines committed jointly to a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and as part of that they agreed to partner with government and other stakeholders to accelerate the development and commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel, so this team-up with Boom could be a key driver of those aims for United long-term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Galactic has a new customer: The International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS), which will be flying researcher, citizen scientist and STEM influencer Kellie Gerardi on an upcoming dedicated Virgin Galactic launch. Gerardi will be conducing a range of experiments on her flight, focused on researching healthcare technologies including a new biomonitor system to study the effects of spaceflights on astronauts in real time.</p>
<p>Gerardi has flown on multiple previous parabolic research flights, which are high-altitude aircraft flights that simulate the reduced gravity environment of space. This will be her first trip to space proper, however, and that transition exemplifies the benefits Virgin Galactic hopes to be able to offer to researchers who previously conducted their work in simulated zero-G conditions.</p>

<p>The biomonitor system that Gerardi will be testing was developed by Canadian startup Hexoskin along with the Canadian Space Agency, and is a wearable array of sensors dubbed &#8216;Astroskin&#8217; that&#8217;s intended to provide monitoring of the impact of launch, reduced gravity, re-entry and landing for those making trips to space. Another experiment Gerardi will perform will test fluid dynamics to inform the design of humidifiers and syringes designed for use in space.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic has booked similar missions previously, including a dedicated flight for scientist Alan Stern, who will be performing experiments on behalf of NASA and the Southwest Research Institute. Much of the attention on the company has focused on its space tourism flights for paying private astronauts, but the potential for commercial research is another key ingredient in its overall business mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp will soon let you use the popular instant messaging app simultaneously on multiple devices, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. The instant messaging app, used by over 2 billion users, also plans to add more options to its disappearing messages feature, top executives said.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/">confirmed to news outlet WaBetaInfo</a> that multi-device support will be arriving on the instant messaging service “soon.” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said users will be able to connect up to four devices to one account. The messaging firm is also working to introduce a dedicated WhatsApp app for the iPad, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we&#8217;ve solved this and we&#8217;re looking forward to getting it out soon!&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The instant messaging service, which last year introduced the ability to set a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">seven-day timer on messages</a> (disappearing mode), is now planning to expand this feature to let users share pictures and videos that can only be viewed once. &#8220;We&#8217;re also about to start rolling out &#8216;view once,&#8217; so you can send content and have it disappear after the person sees it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>WhatsApp users will also get an option to enforce disappearing mode across the app for all new chats.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg and Cathcart told the news outlet &#8212; and it&#8217;s indeed the two of them talking &#8212; that these features will be available to users in public beta “in the next month or two.”</p>

In the coming months, the company plans to open in Cairo, Istanbul and Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often when small e-commerce brands take off, the owner usually starts by being passionate about their product and customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due to no fault of their own, most begin to reach a point of stagnation caused by constraints on working capital, operations, logistics and e-commerce commercial management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnston and Meyer started Opontia to take these burdens off their back by convincing them to sell their brands and for Opontia to manage all parts of their operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the interesting thing, like most companies that roll up e-commerce brands, these owners will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">be involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the day-to-day activities of building the brand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started Opontia to enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to do this both </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> getting an exit now as well as benefiting from future growth,&#8221; Johnston said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We also want to help nurture and build the entrepreneurial e-commerce ecosystem in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Opontia acquires these brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the owners get to share in the increase in profits over the next couple of years, Johnston added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We do this so that they continue to see the benefit of their hard work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-month-old company is particularly interested in brands with at least $10,000 in monthly revenue and at least $5,000 in net profit per month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the categories of products, Opontia has a soft spot for less seasonal &#8220;all-weather&#8221; products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including kitchen products, bathroom, sport, home and living, cosmetics and toys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of startups rolling up e-commerce brands worldwide besides Razor Group, Branded and Thrasio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But none of them has sights on the Middle East and Africa yet, with their bigger and more mature target markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce market, with an annual growth rate of more than 30% and <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/22729/e-commerce-sales-growth-by-region/">annual online sales exceeding $850 billion</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second-largest market, which is the U.S, stands at over $350 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazil has annual sales reaching $36 billion, accounting for <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2453/e-commerce-in-latin-america/">32% of Latin America&#8217;s e-commerce market</a>. For the Middle East and Africa, these numbers are at $30 billion and $25 billion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both regions present Opontia with a huge opportunity. Still, if past happenings in other regions repeat themselves, it wouldn&#8217;t be too long before the company starts facing new competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Every business needs to adopt what model works best in a region but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he founders believe the model used by companies in other markets can also serve the Middle East and Africa, despite differences in size and how they operate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market in the Middle East and Africa is currently less mature than in the West, but is growing faster than any other market in the world, with the number of sellers on marketplace growing at over 50% per year,&#8221; Meyer remarked. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business model will work here because there have been so many amazing entrepreneurs in the Middle East coming up over the last few years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a great opportunity for sellers to be able to realize some of the hard work from building their brand so that they can take a break or work on their next big thing.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, it would&#8217;ve been a concern if Opontia or a similar company launched in both regions, as there just weren&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough sellers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the recent and continued growth in marketplace sellers, there are now more than enough brands for Opontia to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon, with 1 million joining </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia says that its opportunity lies in the 30,000 African and Middle East sellers in Amazon and Noon marketplaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia adds that it will scale acquired brands across their regions and to other parts of the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is in talks with more than 100 small e-commerce brands and claims to have signed &#8220;several term sheets&#8221; with some of them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnston and Meyer come from two distinct e-commerce backgrounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former McKinsey consultant, Johnston worked on e-commerce strategy, private equity and post-merger integration at the Big 3 firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, he spent years doing venture capital, investing and banking across Southern Africa, London, New York and Singapore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Meyer worked as the chief marketplace officer for Lazada and CEO of Next Commerce, an e-commerce enabler in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to acquiring brands, the founders will be looking to hire talent with industry experience, who will be tasked with managing and growing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these brands post-acquisition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://golightyear.com">Lightyear</a>, a new London-based startup coming out of stealth today. The company is building a stock trading app with a focus on creating a truly commission-free app. In addition to waving account fees and trading fees, Lightyear doesn’t charge foreign exchange fees either — up to a certain point.</p>
<p>The two founders met when they were working at Wise — then known as TransferWise. That’s why it makes sense that Lightyear wants to stand out from the crowd with lower foreign exchange fees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinsokk">Martin Sokk</a>, co-founder and CEO of Lightyear, worked at Wise between 2012 and 2017. He has held various roles, such as head of product, head of people and head of operations. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihkel-aamer-9099b918">Mihkel Aamer</a>, Lightyear’s other co-founder and CTO, was an engineering lead at Wise between 2013 and 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Having spent my career in financial services, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. I believe retail investing in Europe is still very much ‘the ugly’ — we’re talking about sneaky fees, less access and complicated products remaining as the status quo,” Mihkel Aamer said in a statement. “We’re building something that will change that by opening up investing up to everyone, whichever global market they want to invest in and however much they want to invest.”</p>
<p>As a user, you can expect a mobile app that lets you buy and sell shares and ETFs. There will be 1,500 stocks and ETFs from multiple markets at launch. Customers won’t pay any account fees, trading fees and foreign exchange fees. But there will be a limit on foreign exchange fees. After £3,000 per month, users will pay 0.35% in FX fees.</p>
<p>The app isn’t quite ready just yet as Lightyear is opening up a waitlist today. The product should roll out at some point during the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160294" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160294" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="808" class="size-full wp-image-2160294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg 11400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=300,237 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=768,606 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=680,537 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=1536,1213 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=2048,1617 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lightyear_Mockup-04b.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lightyear</p></div></p>
<p>Lightyear has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round co-led by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/fund-with-no-name/">new unnamed fund</a> formed by Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and Teleport co-founder Sten Tamkivi Teleport. This is their first investment through this new venture. Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn is also co-leading the found through Metaplanet. There are also several business angels participating in today’s funding round, including Checkout.com CTO Ott Kaukver, former President of Robinhood UK Wander Rutgers, and Veriff founder Kaarel Kotkas.</p>
<p>It’s a nice list of investors but the company will face tough competition from other startups — you’ll likely end up paying more fees if you use one of these competitors, but they’re already well established. For instance, Berlin-based stock trading app <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a> has recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">raised $900 million</a>. In the U.K., <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a> has also managed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/stock-trading-app-freetrade-raises-69-million/">attract</a> 600,000 users.</p>
<p>And yet, more importantly, Lightyear also competes with legacy brokers. Unlike in the U.S., the vast majority of retail investors still rely on traditional banks and web platforms for stock trading. There will be room for more than one company in this space. So let’s see how Lightyear executes in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India may be grappling with the second wave of the coronavirus, rising unemployment, and a dwindling economy, but the South Asian nation’s burgeoning startup ecosystem has never had it better.</p>
<p>High-profile investors in India have long aggressively chased growth-stage, and late-stage deals, pouring <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/indian-startups-raised-7-8-billion-in-first-four-months-of-2021/articleshow/82889825.cms">record amounts of capital</a> into the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. But in a sign of the growing investor bullishness regarding Indian startups, even early-stage companies that have largely been bereft of much similar attention in recent years are now sharing the limelight.</p>
<p>More than 70 early-stage Indian startups are currently in various stages of talks to raise money, according to sources familiar with the matter. The size of the investments vary from a few million dollars to up to $100 million. TechCrunch is reporting some of the more notable deals today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The usual caveat &#8212; that many of deals haven’t yet closed, and that their terms could change or the talks may not materialize into an investment &#8212; applies in our reporting. The deals described below have not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India, the most prolific <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/sequoia-announces-1-35-billion-venture-and-growth-funds-for-india-and-southeast-asia/">investing firm in the country</a>, is in talks to make bets in over two-dozen Indian startups including <strong>Register Book</strong>, a firm that operates an eponymous bookkeeping app; <a href="https://vahvah.com"><strong>Vah Vah</strong></a>, which runs an app to educate people about makeup from artists; SaaS platform <a href="https://bamboobox.ai"><strong>BambooBox</strong></a>, and email marketing software provider <strong>MailModo</strong>.</p>
<p>The firm is also in talks to back, alongside venture fund Nexus, <a href="https://www.onecode.in"><strong>OneCode</strong></a>, a startup that runs an app to connect digital-first brands with sellers. Sequoia Capital India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/sequoia-surge/">launched a dedicated fund for early stage startups called Surge</a> two years ago, is also in talks to invest in <a href="https://probo.in"><strong>Probo</strong></a>, an app to predict future trends; and <strong>Rattle</strong>.</p>
<p>Vaibhav Domkundwar, who runs Better Capital, said the early-stage startup scene in India has never been this hot.</p>
<p>“Pre-seed and seed stage momentum is at its peak, but we are also seeing pre-emptive rounds at Series As and Bs now,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Domkundwar, who has backed over 140 startups including Khatabook and neobank Open, attributed some excitement to the new generation of founders in India, who he said are building product-first and distribution-first companies. “We are seeing the fastest pace of investment in these teams,” he said.</p>
<p>A different investor, who requested anonymity, said that second time founders are now able to raise on a deck or a Notion doc from elite angels, unicorn founders and microVCs. The pace at which these founders are able to close the deal, the investor said, was &#8220;stunning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The frantic pace of investments in early-stage deals come as many of the more mature bets have become unicorns in India and many established startups are finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">exploring taking the public markets</a>.</p>
<p>India has birthed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/home-services-platform-urban-company-raises-255-million-at-2-1-billion-valuation/">14 unicorns this year</a>, up from 11 last year and just 6 in 2019. High-profile investors such as Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">increased their focus on India</a> this year and winning founders with their large size of checks, higher valuation, access to resources, and quick turnaround time.</p>
<p>Many established firms are now chasing early-stage deals.</p>
<p>GSV is in talks to invest in <a href="https://www.findfilo.com"><strong>Filo</strong></a>, a startup that operates an eponymous tutor app; and payments stack startup <strong>Inai</strong> has closed a new round from Better Capital and others and will be part of Y Combinator’s next batch. (Speaking of which, Y Combinator’s previous batch featured its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/">largest cohort of Indian startups in history</a>.)</p>
<p>One-year-old startup <a href="https://www.brightchamps.com"><strong>BrightCHAMPS</strong></a>, which has built a coding and math platform for kids, is also in talks with GSV to raise.</p>
<p><a href="https://indiagold.co"><strong>Indiagold</strong></a>, a startup that allows people in the South Asian nation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/former-paytm-execs-team-up-indiagold/">access credit against their gold reserve</a>, is in talks to close a new round with two high-profile foreign investors that have traditionally backed growth and late stage deals.</p>
<p>Germany’s Razor Group is in late stage talks to invest in <strong>Upscale</strong>, a startup that is attempting to replicate the Thrasio model in India.</p>
<p>Fintech investor RTP is in talks to invest in <strong>Fleek</strong>, a startup that is building “a payments system for subscription economy.” Falcon Edge’s AWI is in talks to invest in <a href="https://www.absolutefoods.in"><strong>Absolute Foods</strong></a> and fitness subscription platform <a href="https://ultrahuman.com"><strong>Ultrahuman</strong></a>, while SaaS platform <a href="https://www.acceldata.io"><strong>AccelData</strong></a> has been approached by Bessemmer and WestBridge.</p>
<p>For high-profile investors with billions in dry powder, there are many rewards for spotting a promising startup in its initial years. One can buy a much larger stake in a startup for lower prices before the valuation of the startup &#8212; assuming things work out well &#8212; soars. Investing early also reduces the amount an investor may lose should things with the portfolio firm goes south.</p>
<p>But not everyone is happy with the new dynamics.</p>
<p>An investor with a micro fund told TechCrunch &#8212; on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly &#8212; that involvement of bigger investors in early stage deals has made it tougher for smaller firms to source new deals as the bigger investors are now aggressively trying to close entire rounds by themselves.</p>
<p>The investor said there is an additional competition in the market now: groups of high-profile founders, who tend to collectively back startups.</p>
<p>The investor cited earlier in the story termed these investments as &#8220;optionality checks.&#8221; These optionality checks &#8212; that usually back second time founders or first time founders who previously worked at a unicorn or soonicorn &#8212; started with the Series A crowd such as Sequoia Capital India, Matrix, Lightspeed India Partners, he said. Now, the investor said, Tiger and Falcon / AWI are doing it, too.</p>
<p>There are two implications of these optionality checks, the investor said. &#8220;They make life more difficult for microVCs / seed VCs as they cannot compete with the Tigers or Falcons or Series A funds who can cut &#8216;smaller&#8217; checks with impunity, and perhaps even dilute less.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the investor cautioned the founders who are raising such optionality checks. &#8220;If the same fund doesn&#8217;t back them in the next round, then the negative signal can imperil their chances of raising from other VCs. Second, the excess money that they get can sometimes encourage faster expansion and higher spends.</p>
<p>Lightspeed India Partners, best known for its investments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/lightspeed-raises-275-million-fund-for-india/">unicorns Oyo Rooms and e-commerce platform Udaan</a>, is in talks to back <a href="https://www.vegrow.in"><strong>Vegrow</strong></a>, a startup that partners with farmers; and has held talks to invest in <a href="https://100ms.live"><strong>100ms.live</strong></a>, which operates an eponymous tool to help developers add video conferencing features to their apps, as well as edtech startup <a href="https://www.kalamlabs.in"><strong>Kalaam Labs</strong></a>.</p>

<p>A survey by InnoVen Capital, results of which were published on Thursday, said that over 80% of the investors it had surveyed said their dealflow for early-stage startups had increased this year, compared to 2020.</p>
<p>Over 75% of the respondents in the same survey said the valuations in recent deals were on the “higher side” because of the “intense competition for high quality deals and entry of large established VCs in this space.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage investment activity has proven to be resilient despite the pandemic, with bigger transaction sizes and higher valuations, a clear sign of a maturing early-stage ecosystem,&#8221; said Tarana Lalwani, Senior Director at InnoVen Capital India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tuesday.vc/">Tuesday Capital</a>, a 10-year-old seed-stage fund that was founded by longtime VC Patrick Gallagher and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, has changed considerably over the years. Arrington now leads a <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">crypto hedge fund</a>. Tuesday was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crunchfund-rebrands-as-tuesday-capital-1528935755">formerly known as Crunchfund</a>. Gallagher now runs the outfit with partner Prashant Fonseka, who joined the fund in 2015 as an associate.</p>
<p>Tuesday has also formed a tight relationship over the years with the industrial design shop Frog Design, which is a limited partner in the fund and sold a portion of its venture portfolio to Tuesday early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/tuesday-capital-teams-up-with-design-powerhouse-frog-to-grab-startups-attention-and-keep-it/">last year</a>. (Tuesday obtained stakes in nine startups in the deal.)</p>
<p>Perhaps most meaningfully, ten years ago, Tuesday didn&#8217;t have stakes in so many portfolio companies. Now that it has backed 600 founders, it has exits to point to and networks to leverage, says Gallagher of why the firm, which recently closed its fourth fund with $30 million, is now investing all over the globe and could be in the market later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both make a huge difference in a frothy market, where everyone and her brother has become an angel investor &#8212; if not a pre-seed fund manager. Indeed, upwards of 30% of Tuesday&#8217;s deal flow now comes from referrals and 15% of its newest stakes are in portfolio companies whose founders have spun out of companies that Tuesday backed previously. Among those many portfolio companies is the cloud computing company DigitalOcean, which <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digitalocean-stock-opens-below-ipo-price-on-first-day-of-trading/">went public</a> in March; the collaborative software maker Airtable, recently valued by its investors at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/">nearly $6 billion</a>; and the pet care marketplace Rover, set to become publicly traded <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pet-care-marketplace-rover-to-go-public-via-spac/">via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>As it happens, the pandemic itself has also changed the firm is unanticipated ways. Though the firm&#8217;s early bets included some that are far flung, such as the buy-now-pay-later fintech <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/kueski-mexican-fintech/">Kueski</a> in Mexico, it is now seeing even more interesting startups outside the Bay Area because Fonseka has been &#8220;living like a nomad&#8221; since early last year &#8212; and talking with founders en route. (Recent stops include Tulum, Mexico; Costa Rica; Virginia; Miami; and Austin. &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure he&#8217;ll land,&#8221; laughs Gallagher. &#8220;He does enjoy this lifestyle.&#8221;)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wAAxGSixgO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/">Applied XL raises $1.5M to build &#8216;editorial algorithms&#8217; that track real-time data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Applied XL raises $1.5M to build &#8216;editorial algorithms&#8217; that track real-time data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/embed/#?secret=wAAxGSixgO" data-secret="wAAxGSixgO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tuesday is also ratcheting up its remote bets thanks in part to Frog, which has offices around the globe and often introduces Tuesday to clients, and to Zoom, which the firm has gotten more comfortable about using to diligence a deal.</p>
<p>One recent check, for example, went to Applied XL, a 16-month-old, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup that&#8217;s developing real-time information systems powered by experts to track the health of people, places and the planet, and which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/">$1.5 million</a> in seed funding led by Tuesday, with participation from Frog (which continues to fund the occasional startup off its balance sheet).</p>
<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed is the firm&#8217;s thinking about its place in the investing universe. While in go-go markets like this one, funds tend to get bigger, write larger checks, and lead deals as time passes, Tuesday is content to write initial checks of $250,000 to $550,000 and to be a syndicate partner.</p>
<p>While everyone has an angle these days, Tuesday has always been, and continues to be, a generalist fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mandate is very broad,&#8221; says Gallagher. &#8220;Prashant is spending time around digital health. I&#8217;ve [long liked] e-commerce and space. But when someone asks, &#8216;Should we show you a B2B deal? Should we show you vertical SaaS?&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we love mission-driven founders, whether consumer or enterprise,&#8221; and whether in California or as far away as Israel.</p>
<p>Tuesday, which also includes associate David Jee, has now backed 29 startups altogether with its newest fund, including the nine it acquired through Frog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roadster, the Palo Alto-based digital platform that gives dealers tools to sell new and used vehicles online has been acquired for $360 million by retail automotive technology company CDK Global Inc., according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1609702/000160970221000043/cdk-20210602.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the all-cash deal, Roadster is now a wholly owned subsidiary. Roadster&#8217;s business model has evolved since its founding in 2013. The online sales platform initially hosted dealers&#8217; inventory on its site, but handled the entire sales process with customers. Roadster now works more directly with dealerships by providing its digital retail tools directly to these businesses through its <a href="https://roadster.com/products#storefront">&#8220;Express&#8221; products</a>.</p>
<p>These digital tools have helped dealerships enter a modern era and serve customers who have become accustomed to completing retail purchases online, particularly in the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumers have shown they are increasingly more willing to purchase big ticket items online, and this trend has quickly accelerated during the pandemic,” said Brian Krzanich, CDK Global&#8217;s president and CEO, in a statement. “To meet their expectations, the automotive industry requires integrations of the right technology, data and infrastructure to better connect its online and in-store experiences.”</p>
<p>CDK is known for making the vehicle sales process easier with digital products like Connected Store, a digital quote, loan and payment tool, or Elead CRM, a leads generating software platform. Roadster&#8217;s assets will connect CDK to dealer back-end-systems for a more seamless end-to-end sales process.</p>
<p>“Automotive retailing is extremely complex, and the best way to create a truly frictionless, end-to-end buying experience is to fully integrate our technology with the back-end systems that power dealership sales, finance and operations, regardless of provider,” said Andy Moss, Roadster&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart accidentally scooped itself by publishing product listings for its own, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=onn+&amp;redirect=false">onn</a>-branded, low-cost Android TV streaming stick to the Walmart.com website ahead of its formal launch, where it <a href="https://twitter.com/AndroidTV_Rumor/status/1399274149835689991?s=19">was soon spotted</a>, alongside an <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device/636597403">upcoming 4K streaming device</a>. Both items are officially arriving next week in stores and online, Walmart told TechCrunch, but it seems the website revealed them a bit earlier than planned.</p>
<p>The entry-level device streaming stick had been <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/walmart-android-tv-stick-leaked-may-launch-under-the-onn-brand-20210317/">leaked</a> earlier this year thanks to its FCC listing, but its online listing caught people&#8217;s eye thanks to its almost absurdly low price point of just $24.88 &#8212; a figure that rivals or even undercuts other streaming sticks on the market, including some from Walmart&#8217;s partner, Roku.</p>
<p>Roku today makes a product line of Walmart exclusives, where its <a href="https://www.roku.com/products/players">cheapest player</a> is the Roku Express 4K at $34.99, currently. Otherwise, Roku&#8217;s most affordable streaming player is the Roku Express, at $24.99. Google&#8217;s entry-level <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv_compare?hl=en-US">Chromecast</a>, meanwhile, is $29.99, and Amazon&#8217;s cheapest Fire TV stick is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YNLBS7R/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c2_odscatsm_0_i?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=QK46P7QPSTN37CK7PN6N&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=46d7f922-acfb-4f96-beb4-f5c8cc052a80&amp;pf_rd_i=8521791011">the Fire TV Stick Lite</a> at $24.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Walmart streaming stick, which is published under the retailer&#8217;s onn electronics brand, falls in line with the specifications you&#8217;d expect to find on a low-cost device like this. It support FHD (Full HD, meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p">1080p</a>), Dolby Audio, and ships with an Android TV-style remote (with batteries included), 1 HDMI Extender, AC adapter, and 1 USB to Micro-USB cable.</p>

<p>The system itself is powered by Android TV, which offers an easy way for consumers to turn a regular TV into a smart TV with access to streaming apps, voice control, and the ability to &#8220;cast&#8221; content like photos, video and music to the TV. Device owners can also ask Google Assistant to control their TV with their voice, and access over 700,000 movies and TV shows from the Android TV interface.</p>
<p>The included remote offers a Google Assistant button and dedicated buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max.</p>
<p>The stick may not be the sort of thing you&#8217;d use in your living room for your big screen, but may make sense to add to another, less important TV &#8212; like the one in the kid&#8217;s room or guest room &#8212; where having the top specs isn&#8217;t as essential.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walmart is addressing the higher-end of the streaming market with its new 4K Android TV streamer <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device/636597403?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_zdY2WmQSGxyLT0swUx0Mo37nUkBzaL35TTi5XA0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_10078&amp;clickid=zdY2WmQSGxyLT0swUx0Mo37nUkBzaL35TTi5XA0&amp;sharedid=aftvnews.com&amp;affiliates_ad_id=612734&amp;campaign_id=9383">the $29.88 Onn UHD Streaming Device</a>, also published ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>The overall concept here is the same, but offers an affordable upgrade to 4K streaming.</p>
<p>The retailer&#8217;s <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=onn+&amp;redirect=false">onn brand</a> today carries a range of devices, including TVs, headphones, portable speakers, tablets, and other accessories.

<p>Walmart confirmed the new streaming devices are preparing to launch in stores and online in the retailer&#8217;s full assortment starting next week. Despite the website saying only a few devices are in stock or are out of stock, Walmart assures us there is, in fact, plenty of inventory available.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a year ago, Google <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561">announced</a> a couple of leadership changes that saw Prabhakar Raghavan, who joined the company back in 2012, take over the lead of Search, Assistant and Maps. Now, sources familiar with the hiring tell us, the company has hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherphillips1/">Christopher Phillips</a>, who was previously the chief product and technology officer at SiriusXM, to lead its geo team, which is responsible for products like Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Maps Platform, the company&#8217;s enterprise business around these products. Google has confirmed his hire but declined to share any additional information. Phillips will officially join the company later this month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160608" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160608" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2160608" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?w=300" alt="Christopher Phillips" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160608" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Christopher Phillips/LinkedIn</p></div></p>
<p>Phillips came to SiriusXM after the company acquired music service Pandora last year. Before the acquisition, he spent six years as Pandora&#8217;s CPO and head of Technology, a role he took after leading product and design for Amazon Music from 2012 to 2014 and executive roles at Workspeed and Intuit before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In his new role at Google, Phillips will lead both product and engineering for the Geo team and report directly to Raghavan, who will continue to oversee Search, Assistant, Geo, Commerce and Ads. Before last year&#8217;s leadership shuffle, Jen Fitzpatrick essentially played a similar role for the Geo team.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561">Search Engine Land</a>, Dane Glasgow and Liz Reid became the leads for the Geo team after her departure. Glasgow has since departed Google and is now at Facebook, while Reid recently <a href="https://searchengineland.com/prabhakar-raghavan-googles-head-of-search-appoints-new-leads-347498">took on a new role</a> to lead Google&#8217;s search experiences. That obviously left a bit of a vacuum, which Phillips will now fill.</p>
<p>While Phillips doesn&#8217;t have any direct experience in building geo products, he does bring with him extensive experience in managing product-oriented engineering teams. His hiring also comes at an interesting time for Google Maps, which only recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/google-maps-to-add-more-detailed-maps-crowd-indicators-better-routing-and-more/">announced</a> a number of <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/redefining-what-map-can-be-new-information-and-ai/">major updates</a> and which is becoming an increasingly important part of Google&#8217;s product portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As dating app Tinder and its parent company Match explore the future of personal connection through apps, it&#8217;s interesting to see what sort of ideas it tested but later discarded. One such experiment was something called &#8220;Tinder Mixer,&#8221; which had briefly offered Tinder users a way to join group video chats, and &#8220;play games&#8221; with others nearby.</p>
<p>The feature was tested for a short period of time last year in New Zealand, we understand, but will not be launching.</p>
<p>The Tinder Mixer experience was uncovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who found references the product in the Tinder Android app&#8217;s code. He had not yet publicized the finding, as we worked to learn more about the origins of the product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160545" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160545" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160545" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The resources he found in the dating app had given the appearance of a product in the midst of development, Paluzzi noted, but as it turns out it was one that had already been tested and quickly shut down as Tinder continued its other, ongoing experiments in the dating market.</p>
<p>According to Tinder, the Tinder Mixer test has no impact on its product roadmap this year, and the Tinder Mixer experience described here will likely never come into existence.</p>
<p>That said, what made the product particularly intriguing was that it saw Tinder venturing, however briefly and experimentally, into more of a social discovery space, compared with the usual Tinder experience. Typically, Tinder users swipe on daters&#8217; profiles, match, chat and sometimes even <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046122311-Face-to-Face-Video-Chat">video call</a> each other on a one-on-one basis. But live video chatting with a group is not something Tinder today offers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160546" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160546" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160546" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160546" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>That said, the idea of going live on video is not new to Match.</p>
<p>This is an area where the company has experimented before, including with its apps Plenty of Fish, which <a href="https://blog.pof.com/2020/03/what-is-the-live-feature-on-plenty-of-fish/">offers a one-to-many video broadcasting feature</a>, and <a href="https://ablo.live/">Ablo</a>, which offers one-on-one video chats with people around the world. These experiments constitute what the company considers &#8220;dating-adjacent&#8221; experiences. In other words, you <em>could</em> meet someone through these video interactions, but that&#8217;s not necessarily their main goal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160543" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160543" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>These video experiences have continued even as Match announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">$1.73 billion acquisition of Seoul-based Hyperconnect</a> &#8212; its biggest acquisition ever, and one that puts the company more on the path towards a future that involves the &#8220;social discovery&#8221; and live streaming market.</p>
<p>The company believes social discovery an area with vast potential, and a market it estimates that could be twice the size of dating, in fact.</p>
<p>Match Group CEO Shar Dubey spoke to this point recently at the JP Morgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference, noting that on some of its bigger platforms, Match has seen that a number of its users were looking for more of &#8220;a shared experience and a sense of community among other like-minded single people on the platform,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She noted that technology has reached a point where people could now interact with others through richer experiences than the traditional dating flow of swipe-match-chat allowed for, including few-to-few, many-to-many, and one-to-many type of experiences.</p>
<p>Hyperconnect brings to Match much of the technology that would allow the company to expand in these areas.</p>
<p>Today, it offers two apps, Azar and Hakuna Live, which let users to connect with one another online. The former, launched in 2014, is focused on one-on-one live video and voice chats while the latter, launched in 2019 is in the online broadcast space. Not coincidentally, these apps mirror the live stream experiences that Match has been running on Plenty of Fish and Ablo.</p>
<p>Because these live streaming services are often more heavily adopted by younger demographics, it makes sense that Match may have wanted to also test out such a live stream experience on Tinder, which also skews younger, even if the test ultimately only served as a way to collect data as opposed to informing a specific future product&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>With the Hyperconnect deal soon to be finalized, the incoming apps will initially give Match an expanded footprint in the live streaming and social discovery market in Asia &#8212; 75% of Hyperconnect&#8217;s usage and revenue comes from markets in Asia. Match then plans to leverage its international experience and knowledge to accelerate their growth in other markets where they haven&#8217;t yet broken through.</p>
<p>But another major reason for the acquisition is that Match sees the potential in deploying Hyperconnect&#8217;s technology across its existing portfolio of dating apps to not only create richer experiences but also to cater to users in markets where the &#8220;Western&#8221; way of online dating hasn&#8217;t yet been fully embraced, but social discovery has.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there is real synergy of bringing some of these experiences that are popular in social discovery platforms onto our dating platforms, as well as sort of enhance the social discovery platforms and help people get to their dating intent, should they choose to,&#8221; Dubey explained, at the JP Morgan conference.</p>
<p>What any of that may mean for Tinder, more specifically, is not yet known.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 2, 2021. It’s a good day in the tech world because former unicorn Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">is out with new features about <em>you</em></a>. Yes, the company is taking its yearly listening review to a midyear format and packing its app with even more personalized mixes. My playlists are why I won’t leave Spotify until the heat death of the universe, so I suppose it makes sense that the service is doubling down on its personalization feature set.</p>
<p>And yes, I do listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1400164730036277252">a lot of Taylor Swift in the morning</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-acquired-by-prosus-for-a-reported-1-8-billion/">Stack Overflow sells for $1.8B</a>: </strong>Well-known developer community and hub of copy-pastable coding snippets for software engineers of all skill levels Stack Overflow is selling itself to Prosus for nearly $2 billion. What’s Prosus? It’s part of Naspers, a South African investing group that you may have heard of. Naspers is perhaps best known for owning a large stake in Tencent.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/guild-education-valued-at-3-75-billion-with-newest-round/"><strong>Guild Education raises $150M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The company, focused on providing what TechCrunch described as “employer-sponsored learning opportunities” for employees, is now worth $3.75 billion after its latest funding round. For the burgeoning edtech startup market, the round is big news. There’s still lots of capital for tech companies tackling the various sides of the education market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/reading-the-ipo-markets-tea-leaves/"><strong>The great technology company liquidity run continues</strong></a><strong>: </strong>As well-known tech startups like Marqeta look to list, other companies are jumping on the bandwagon. TechCrunch reported this morning that fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/yieldstreet-raises-100m-as-it-mulls-going-public-via-spac-eyes-acquisitions/">Yieldstreet may go public via a SPAC</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">data-centered unicorn Confluent is also going public</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The week’s busy startup fundraising cycle continued today with a host of companies from the very earliest stages to the most mature unicorns raising capital. What follows is a selection of the day’s hottest deals. We’re starting in the world of wheels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/"><strong>Faction raises $4.3M for three-wheeled delivery vehicles</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That are driverless, we should add. Daily Crunch is certain that, simply given the sheer amount of capital that has gone into the various projects of this sort, it will eventually work. Perhaps Faction will be the company to get it right.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/"><strong>FlixMobility raises $650M for its low-cost bus service</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you are American, you may have not heard of FlixMobility, which operates FlixBus and FlixTrain, low-cost transport services in Europe. The company is also working to expand in the U.S. For reference, the new Flix round is a Series <em>G</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/"><strong>Tier options $60M for e-scooter network</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Electric scooter shares are <em>not</em> dead, it turns out. Sure, Bird’s SPAC demonstrates how difficult the economics proved for the model in some markets, but Tier now has access to a “highly scalable asset-backed debt facility,” in the words of its CFO, to keep growing. The company also has some neat battery tech aboard its portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, today’s other rounds of note tackling a more diverse set of industries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stemma-launches-with-4-8m-seed-to-build-managed-data-catalogue/"><strong>Stemma raises $4.8M for managed Amundsen</strong></a><strong>: </strong>What’s Amundsen? Per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a>, it’s a “data catalogue project that [Lyft built] to manage its massive data requirements.” And now there’s a startup offering it as a service. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">reminds me of BuildBuddy to a degree</a>, in which a startup takes on a BigCo tool, helping others access and leverage it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/"><strong>$131M in total capital for Jeeves</strong></a><strong>: </strong> It’s $31 million in equity funding and $100 million in debt access, which we presume is a revolving facility of sorts because Jeeves is building a multinational expense management platform. You know, for companies that have employees everywhere. Like every single early-stage startup we talk to these days.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/divido-bags-30m-to-take-its-buy-now-pay-later-platform-to-more-markets/"><strong>Divido raises money because apparently we still need more buy now, pay later (BNPL) services</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Divido has put together a fresh $30 million round to bring its BNPL service to more markets, TechCrunch reports. The startup BNPL market has been hot because the companies in it have been doing well. But at some point we hit saturation, right? <em>Right?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>With $1.6B Depop purchase, Etsy asks, &#8216;How do you do, fellow kids?&#8217;</h2>
<p>News broke today that Etsy will buy used fashion marketplace Depop in a transaction that values the U.K.-based startup at $1.625 billion.</p>
<p>Depop showed 100% year-over-year growth to reach $70 million in revenue last year, but it&#8217;s still worth asking whether Etsy paid a premium to expand its reach into the hearts, minds and wallets of Gen Z and young millennial consumers.</p>
<p>To frame the deal&#8217;s overall value in a larger context, let&#8217;s look at revenue multiples for rivals Poshmark and ThredUp. If large e-commerce players are willing to splash out for youth-approved marketplaces, there&#8217;s a good reason why.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech was super busy today, Spotify aside. Today we’re talking Amazon, Apple, Facebook, GitLab and Huawei:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"><strong>Welcome to 2021, Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The American e-commerce giant is doing away with cannabis testing of its employees. Our first reaction to this news was that <em>Amazon was drug testing its employees?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/"><strong>Apple thinks highly of itself</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Apple has a study out saying that it facilitated more than a half-trillion dollars in commerce last year. We are sure that Apple really put itself to the test in coming up with the number.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook does two things that don’t suck:</strong> Today Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/">opened up its Messenger API to all companies</a>, which is good. And Big Blue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/">put together a research API</a>. Both are good things from Zuck’s empire. Which is nice to say for once.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/gitlab-acquires-unreview-as-it-looks-to-bring-more-ml-tools-to-its-platform/"><strong>GitLab buys UnReview</strong></a><strong>:</strong> GitLab is north of $100 million in revenue and is slated for an eventual IPO, so it’s big enough to warrant inclusion in this section. Regardless, the GitHub competitor has bought a startup that “helps software teams recommend the best reviewers for when developers want to check in their latest code” using machine learning. Honestly, that sounds cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/"><strong>Huawei’s new OS loves Android</strong></a><strong>:</strong> TechCrunch has lots of details on HarmonyOS, the new operating system from Huawei. It turns out that it <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/02/huawei-harmonyos-android-launch/">uses some Android code</a>. All hail Google, we suppose.</li>
</ul>
