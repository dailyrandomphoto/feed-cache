										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.olo.com/">Olo</a>, the New York-based fintech startup that provides order processing software to restaurants, shared its initial IPO price range this morning. The company&#8217;s debut comes ahead of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981?mod=hp_lista_pos2">the expected IPO of Toast</a>, a Boston-based unicorn with a similar market remit.</p>
<p>Targeting $16 to $18 per share, Olo could raise as much as $372.6 million in its public offering.</p>

<hr />
<p>Unlike most companies going public in recent quarters that we&#8217;ve tracked, Olo has a history of growth and profitability, making its impending pricing all the more interesting. It&#8217;s unknown if Toast is profitable, but as most venture-backed IPO aren&#8217;t, we&#8217;re presuming it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re doing our usual work: parsing the company&#8217;s pricing interval to get a valuation range for Olo. We&#8217;ll calculate both simple and fully-diluted pricing and then do some quick work on its revenue scale to come to grips with its total scale.</p>
<p>Are investors willing to pay more for profits? And, if so, how much? This is a niche question, as most IPOs look a bit more like Coursera than Olo, but it&#8217;s still worth answering.</p>
<h2>Olo&#8217;s IPO valuation range</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow along, you can read the new S-1 filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001431695/000119312521072308/d867519ds1a.htm">here</a>. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">first look at Olo is here</a>, and its fundraising history is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olo">here</a>, per Crunchbase.</p>
<p>The company is targeting $16 to $18 per share with an expected sale of 18 million shares. The company is also reserving 2.7 million shares for its underwriters. At the upper-end of its range, not counting shares reserved for its bankers, Olo could raise $324 million in its debut.</p>
<p>Per the company, its total number of Class A and B shares outstanding after its IPO would come to 142,012,926, or what we calculate to be 144,712,926 shares, including its underwriters&#8217; option. Using the latter as we tend to look for valuation extremes, Olo would be worth $2.32 billion to $2.60 billion.</p>
<p>But what about its fully-diluted valuation? Adding in shares that are currently tied to un-exercised but vested stock options brings Olo to around 188,085,714 shares. Add in the underwriters&#8217; option and the total rises to 190,785,714 shares.</p>
<p>Using the latter figure, at $16 and $18 per share Olo could be worth $3.05 billion to $3.43 billion on a fully-diluted basis.</p>
<h2>Is that expensive?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out! Digging back into Olo&#8217;s growth, we can see a business with rapidly expanding software incomes. And the same software revenues are improving in quality over time. From 2019 to 2020, for example, Olo&#8217;s &#8220;platform&#8221; revenues &#8212; a mix of subscription and transaction top-line from software &#8212; grew from $45.1 million to $92.8 million. Over the same time, the company&#8217;s platform revenue saw its gross margin improve from 73.6% to 84.6%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are so many ways to secure capital for your startup beyond traditional venture capital, from crowdfunding to debt financings to revenue-share agreements. But is all money created equal if you are on route to becoming a billion-dollar business? Dr. Astrid Scholz, the co-founder of Zebras Unite, Sydney Thomas, a principal at Precursor Ventures, and Brian Brackeen, the founding partner of Lightship Capital, joined us as TC Sessions: Justice to discuss alternative pathways to funding, and if the democratization of capital is a facade.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On the choice to stay away from traditional venture capital</strong></h3>
<p>Scholz is currently building out Zebras Unite, a founder-led cooperative that is focused on making startups more sustainable, ethical and inclusive. During the panel, she mentioned that the capital arm of Zebras Unite could have been a traditional fund, but the organization ultimately decided to pursue more creative alternatives, such as the <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/capital-services">Future Economy Lab</a>. This lab, which focuses on helping founders find financing instruments that fit their sectors, took place in Montreal with a focus on climate tech.</p>
<p>Scholz shared why she went for this route, versus a traditional fund:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>In the big scheme of things, [VC] really is just a tiny drop in the large capital pool of capital that&#8217;s out there. And then on the other extreme, you have bank loans. That may or may not be accessible to startup founders, especially if they&#8217;re from certain demographics in this country. Of course we have a massive racial wealth gap and access to capital.</p>
<p>To me, that sounds just like two flavors of capital: vanilla and chocolate. It&#8217;s not interesting, if that was an ice cream store, it was not interesting. At Zebras Unite, we&#8217;re looking to increase the diversity of capital, as well as the diversity of managers of capital. So we&#8217;re very interested in revenue based financing mechanisms. We&#8217;re very interested in non-dilutive early stage forms of support to entrepreneurs who don&#8217;t have friends and family wealth. We were looking at new sort of character-based lending instruments and a bunch of blended approaches, so there&#8217;s more room on the capital spectrum to color in, beyond the two ends of the spectrum. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><strong>On why venture capital paths can be formed around a more inclusive strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Now, venture capital isn’t the devil, and in a market as hot as right now it’s clear that there is a huge demand to back great ideas. The problem starts when you look at which ideas get backed versus which don’t, and underrepresented founders lose out at a disproportionately higher rate than white founders.</p>
<p>Standards help everyone get on the same page, and in venture, any clarity around how one investor cuts checks versus another can help curb signaling risk and help set expectations on early-stage founders. Lightship Capital uses traditional venture capital but applies it in a way Brackeen thinks is more inclusive to founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oftentimes, VCs talk about designing your product for your customer, but then they don&#8217;t design themselves around the customer. They completely ignore what they tell people to do. And so we&#8217;re designed for the underrepresented founders. And for us, that&#8217;s women, minorities, lgbtq, plus disabled. And so the capital path for that founder is different from the white male Zuckerberg founder. Oftentimes, a Series A is very, very difficult, so we bridge that. We’ll write a smaller check &#8211; half a million dollars first &#8211; and then we’ll reserve $1.5 million so they can go out and get a Series A done. And so to do that, we don&#8217;t require board seats and things of that nature, we do require strong collaboration<em>. <strong>(Timestamp: 7:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On how your first check could impact your next check </strong></h3>
<p>Thomas noted that Indie.VC, an alternative financing program that was aimed at slow-growth, bootstrapped founders, shutting down this past week could be a lesson for founders who look to finance their companies from the plethora of programs out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>They were at the frontiers of building access to new capital. I think one of the things that we saw when we would talk to founders who were considering Indie.vc capital versus our capital was, ‘does the investor that you would like after you get that Indie.vc funding, if you decide to go to a more traditional VC firm? Can they actually even do revenue based financing investments, some people actually legitimately can&#8217;t because of the regulatory limits of their fund.<em><strong>(Timestamp: 16:28)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>She went on to explain how this isn’t simply a one-off problem that could happen with. Precursor founding partner Charles Hudson penned a post, months ago, about the <a href="https://www.charleshudson.net/we-only-have-100-points-of-equity-to-split-up">messiness in early-stage cap tables. </a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s unfair, but you have to make a pretty final decision, pretty early on in what type of company you want to build. And I don&#8217;t think that allows for a lot of the flexibility that is the reality of building a startup. When you pivot like five to 10 to 20 to 30 times before you finally get to something that, you know, matters. And so how do we also allow for more flexibility between multiple different types of revenue structures? I just don’t think that exists right now. <strong>(Timestamp: 17:12) </strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Brackeen added that his form loves non-dilutive financing before, and after, they are nicest. Pitch competitions might help a startup launch, but it won’t help founders get from stage to stage. This banter basically answers the question that I set early on: is all capital created equal in the eyes of investors? A cap table filled with different types of financing structures and notes, as Thomas mentions, could lead to your next check investor declining to invest based on a semantic versus a lack of believing in your vision. One side effect we see here is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/a-recapitalization-reckoning/">recapitalizations</a>, an event where startups restructure their entire cap table to squeeze out old investors, bring on new ones and shift the way equity and debt is managed.</p>
<p>Scholz chimed in about how startups should think about capital limitations, but also other corporate structures that could shape the trajectory of a startup.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think that point about founders basically getting locked into a corporate structure and an investment strategy before they even really know what they&#8217;re building or how it&#8217;s selling is just so important. I always joke, you know, like 99 out of 100, corporate lawyers will tell you to incorporate as a Delaware C. [But] that may or may not be the right answer. There may be a good reason to become a cooperative, and incorporating as a Delaware C will make your life very difficult.<strong> (Timestamp: 17:46)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On if VC will be even more relevant five years from now</strong></h3>
<p>The conversation turned into a broader discussion on if venture capital will be as relevant as it is today, five years from now. While Scholz said that she doesn’t even think venture is that important today, the two venture capitalists on the panel &#8211; Brackeen and Thomas &#8211; were good sports about the future of the asset class they have bet their careers on.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Thomas:</strong> The IPOs just keep on coming, and they keep getting bigger. It’s crazy. I think that there is recreating an immense amount of wealth, and that we need to be thoughtful, we need to be careful. And we need to be just considerate of that fact. And so I plan to be in venture for the next ten years. But I Ithink, to Astrid’s point, we are not the only ones on the island. We are connected to all of these other different capital structures, and different communities. But my bet is still here. <strong>(Timestamp 25:14) </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Brackeen:</strong> Capital will continue to play a large role in capitalism, because the two are hand in hand. And venture capital is a version of that. Watch what we do. To see billions of dollars go into these geographies, these communities, these groups, the value creation is outrageous. Morgan Stanley, and others say that racism and sexism cost this country somewhere between $4 trillion and $16 trillion in kind of untapped value. So venture capital can be a key lever in opening </em><em>that faucet. <strong>(Timestamp: 25:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only a matter of time before someone married the nascent nootropic supplements for brain health to the snack bar craze that continues to attract dollars and exits.</p>
<p>That time is apparently now, as Rob Dyrdek, the MTV-famous celebrity, pro-skater and entrepreneur, and Chris Bernard announce a new investment in the company they co-founded, <a href="http://www.getmindright.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mindright</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, alongside celebrity investors including Joe Jonas, Travis Barker, and The Profit&#8217;s Marcus Lemonis. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;When we started down the path of condition-specific food and beverage&#8230; we started doing a lot of research into the nootropics and adaptogens space,&#8221; said co-founder Bernard. Working with a food scientist who did not want to be named (which isn&#8217;t sketchy at all), Dyrdek and Bernard were introduced to several companies producing Ashwagandha, which the two had settled on as the new key ingredient in their snack bars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with ginseng and cordyceps mushrooms, the company has a trifecta of new (and old) supplements that have taken the nutraceutical world by storm.</p>
<p>Bernard had initially approached the <a href="https://dyrdekmachine.com/">Dyrdek Machine</a> group about another product, but the company was too far along and not something that Dyrdek felt passionate about backing. The story changed when Bernard returned with plans for this nootropic nosh.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[Bernard] brought back the concept of the path of what’s evolved from functional foods and probiotics and collagen and sort of the mental health and adaptogen and the supplement world and said here’s how to merge these,&#8221; Dyrdek said of Bernard&#8217;s second pitch. &#8220;It was a home-run for us. Our process is supporting a solopreneur where we help shape and build the company together and provide the outsourced resources. We fund the development of the idea to go to the capital markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So far, Drydek and his team have made 15 investments in consumer and entertainment businesses, and five of those business have since been acquired.</p>
<p>Most deals from Dyrdek Machine follow a similar trajectory. The firm becomes a co-founder and shares common stock and then negotiate a preferred equity investment for the capital infusion. Typically those deals will range from $250,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We co-found it and we share that common share class and our first money is preferred and pick a valuation that balances out the deal,&#8221; Dyrdek said. &#8220;How much equity do we want to develop it with you is what we negotiate with that initial capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122278" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122278" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122278" class="wp-caption-text">Portrait of Rob Dyrdek, founder of <a href="https://dyrdekmachine.com/">Dyrdek Machine</a></p></div></p>
<p>Dyrdek describes his investment firm as founder-driven and market agnostic. &#8220;We want a well-rounded, multi-dimensional founder and then we look at the market and how do we evolve it into something that has a larger, broader appeal,&#8221; Dyrdek said. &#8220;Rather than chasing down nootropics, we found that &#8216;good mood&#8217; was the important thing to the consumer base. That&#8217;s why we drove &#8216;Good mood superfood.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernard&#8217;s faith in Dyrdek&#8217;s ability to move the business forward has been proven in the evolution of other companies in the firm&#8217;s portfolio. Dyrdek pointed to Outstanding Foods, another investment, which he said had recently closed a $10 million round at a $100 million valuation. Another startup in the portfolio, Momentous, a supplement manufacturer, also closed on a big round recently after raising $5 million in 2019, Dyrdek said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Gig Workers Collective co-founder and organizer Vanessa Bain, The Congress of Essential Workers founder and former Amazon warehouse worker Christian Smalls and National Council for Occupational Safety and Health Co-Executive Director Jessica E. Martinez about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On the Amazon union drive</h3>
<p>Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama are in the midst of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/">historic union drive</a>. Smalls, who was fired from his job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island last year after speaking out about the lack of personal protective equipment, told me he recently spent a few days in Bessemer.</p>
<blockquote><p>The building opened up when Coronavirus started. When New York City became the epicenter, that&#8217;s when Bessemer facility opened up. So the union got a head start on talking to workers. So that&#8217;s a gem for anybody or any union that plans on trying to unionize the building &#8212; that you have a facility in your community that&#8217;s about to open up, when opening, that&#8217;s the best time to connect with workers. That&#8217;s what happened last year. And as a result, the workers had seen what happened to the workers that were unprotected and they don&#8217;t want that. They want better for themselves. And they rightfully desrve that, especially in Alabama. It&#8217;s a right to work state, a state with no state minimum, obviously a red state. So I think it&#8217;s a lot of intangibles against them. But these workers now see the window of opportunity for change systemically. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:40)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, President Biden recently came out in support of the unionizing efforts in Bessemer.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would hope that he is a man of his word. He&#8217;s a pro-union guy. He ran his campaign off of that, saying he&#8217;s a union guy and unions need to be strong, and he supports unions all the way. It was powerful to see that the President, the man, the highest plateau in the country, support the union. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:11)</strong></em></p>
<p>[&#8230;] But once again, like Vanessa said, I don&#8217;t put all my eggs in that basket either. I just want to hold him accountable. Make sure that, you. know, we see this all the way through to the end. Even if Alabama is not successful, if we were to try again, in other locations, other parts of the country, that we have the support of the highest power in the country, that is the most powerful thing that will resonate with workers. So it&#8217;s good to see that it&#8217;s happening now. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 14:17)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3>On the effects of Prop 22</h3>
<p>Already, Prop 22 has affected industries outside of tech. In December, supermarket chain Albertsons began replacing delivery drivers with contractors and hundreds of employees in California were swapped for DoorDash workers, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. Meanwhile, tech companies have spoken about implementing Prop 22-like legislation in other parts of the country. Martinez described how some California residents who voted to pass Prop 22 thought they were supporting workers for better access to rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>And unfortunately, you have workers who have possibly died. We have a California rideshare driver who died from COVID-19 last month. His independent classification means his family will receive no workers&#8217; compensation. That is a huge impact to workers and the reality of how it impacts day to day life for workers and in the midst of a pandemic. So I share that, because Prop 22 sets the tone, again, for what could happen nationally. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:00)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Bain said she sees the passing of Prop 22 as a failure of &#8220;our entire structure of economy.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>And we have really allowed tech to run rampant under this pretense that somehow it&#8217;s innovative, and especially within the gig economy. I mean, it&#8217;s the opposite of innovative, right? Like it&#8217;s feudalism on your phone, right? It&#8217;s 1-800 dial listserv. So it&#8217;s like, they&#8217;re not doing anything new that justifies creating an entirely different classification of labor than existed before, which is what Prop 22 did, right? It literally created this category of marketplace contractor that retains neither the protections of an independent contractor nor an employee. And allowing, you know, companies to write their own laws in this way is a systemic failure. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:57)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On the PRO Act</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s legislation in the U.S. Senate right now that aims to make it easier for workers to organize and form unions in the country. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act seeks to change labor laws in favor of giving workers more power.</p>
<p>Bain spoke about the importance of getting the PRO Act across the line in light of the passing of Prop 22 in California.</p>
<blockquote><p>These things shouldn&#8217;t be at the mercy of who happens to be, you know, held to a position. These are things that should be codified and enshrined really in law. And things that should be consistent and stable protections that people can rely on and count on. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 20:22)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Martinez explained how the PRO Act aligns with the <a href="https://nationalcosh.org/sites/default/files/2021-02%20National%20Agenda%20for%20Worker%20Safety%20and%20Health.pdf">work she&#8217;s doing at COSH</a>. The organization recently released a national agenda for worker safety and health, along with some recommendations.</p>
<blockquote><p>We want stronger safety laws, tougher enforcement, including a mandatory emergency standard to prevent the spread of infectious disease. And again, this is federally so if there is an ETS or an emergency [temporary] standard pass, it applies all over and impacts all kinds of workers, stronger protections against retaliation. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 07:53)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Martinez added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Employers will funnel resources to try to scare tactics to scare workers from organizing, demanding safer workplaces, job security, and so forth. [The agenda] also includes workers are included in all policy decisions. We believe strongly that workers, more than anyone, understand the job, know the solutions and controls to health and safety issues, and also equity and Inclusion to end the misclassification and better protections for temporary gig workers. Paid sick and family leave for workers also worker centered health protocols, including health for high risk workers and getting access to vaccines. And we want to confront the workplace effects of climate change. Finally, also prevent chemical catastrophes and harmful exposure. [&#8230;] With that said, this is not working in isolation. It works in collaboration with laws, we&#8217;re hoping that will pass, such as the PRO Act, allowing workers to gain bargaining power when organizing, essentially giving them the ability to negotiate with the employer get access to benefits again, such as some job security paid sick leave workers comp and so forth. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 8:23)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

The former was up 23% YoY, while the latter grew at a far slower 5% rate.</p>
<p>As for the entire year, the company reported $2.9 billion in total FY2020 revenue, up 10% YoY. That broke down to $1.6 billion in consumer net revenue up 20% YoY, and $1.3 billion in enterprise net revenue, an increase of just 1% for the full year.</p>
<p>The company has a complex history, starting life in the 1980s selling firewall software.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paypal-to-acquire-curv-301242347.html">announced</a> that it plans to acquire Curv, a cryptocurrency startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Israeli newspaper Calcalist <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3896291,00.html">originally reported</a> the move. And PayPal has now made an official announcement.</p>
<p>Curv is a cryptocurrency security company that helps you store your crypto assets securely. The company operates a cloud-based service that lets you access your crypto wallets without any hardware device.</p>
<p>Curv also lets you set up sophisticated policies so that the new intern cannot withdraw crypto assets without some sort of approval chain. Similarly, you can create allow lists so that regular transactions can go through more easily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, Curv uses multi-party computation to handle private keys. When you create a wallet, cryptographic secrets are generated on your device and on Curv’s servers. Whenever you’re trying to initiate a transaction, multiple secrets are used to generate a full public and private key.</p>
<p>Secrets are rotated regularly and you can’t do anything with just one secret. If somebody steals an unsecured laptop, a hacker cannot access crypto funds with the information stored on this device alone.</p>
<p>As you can see, Curv isn’t a cryptocurrency wallet for end users. The company offers its services to exchanges, brokers and over-the-counter desks. If you’re running a fund and you plan on buying a large amount of cryptocurrencies, you could also consider using Curv.</p>
<p>Finally, financial institutions that are looking for a solution to store digital assets and diversify their balance sheet could also work with Curv.</p>
<p>PayPal says that the Curv team will join the cryptocurrency group within PayPal. The payment giant has been gradually rolling out cryptocurrency products. It has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">partnered with Paxos</a> so that users in the U.S. can buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies from their PayPal account.</p>
<p>In the near future, PayPal also plans to let you buy and sell items using cryptocurrencies. During its <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/PYPL_Q4-20_Investor_Update-%281%29.pdf">most recent earnings release</a>, the company also said that it plans to launch cryptocurrency products in other countries and in Venmo, the consumer fintech super app owned by PayPal.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are undisclosed and the transaction should close at some point during the first half of 2021. Calcalist <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3896291,00.html">reported</a> that PayPal was paying between $200 million and $300 million for the acquisition. A person close to the company says that the transaction was under $200 million. I guess we’ll find out what happened exactly in the next earnings release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While not entirely non-existent, the union has been an elusive phenomenon in Silicon Valley. More recently, however, big names like Google and Kickstarter have taken key steps toward forming unions, as have smaller startups like Glitch, which made history this week by signing a collective bargaining agreement – the first team of software engineers to do so. Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama, meanwhile, are currently on the cusp of forming their own historic union. In this panel from TC Sessions: Justice, we discuss how we got here, what comes next and steps tech employees can take.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On Why Now?</h3>
<p>As has been the case with management throughout history, tech companies have long fought tooth and nail against labor organizing. Over the course of the last couple of years, however, we may have seen something of a critical mass that could represent the beginnings of a sea change for the industry.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Redwine:</strong> It seems like tech workers are reacting to some of the maturity of tech and the expansion of the platforms that we all work on, and also more worker instability in general in the US, especially. I think it&#8217;s sort of a response that workers are becoming more formal in their organizing efforts<em><strong>. (Timestamp: 1:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Parul Koul (Google):</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Koul:</strong> A variety of tactics and strategies have been tried, and we’ve been able to analyze the successes and failures of past movements and arrive at a point where we’ve developed enough institutional and organizational knowledge to try something new and – in some ways – more complex.<strong> (</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 3:25)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On Whether The Pandemic Will Spur More Organizing</h3>
<p>Covid-19 has radically transformed where – and how – we work. It’s upended many industries and cause millions to lose jobs. Could the pandemic prove to be yet another inflection point for a growing movement.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Koul:</strong> In our case, what we saw was companies moving to work from home and then, in certain categories of employees, not really receiving the same benefits […] whether it’s a stipend to buy equipment or even having the benefit from working from home […] We also saw a mass movement and social and political protests against police brutality erupt right in the middle of the pandemic. For me, and many other organizers at Google, it really galvanized us to do something and respond to that in the streets and in our own way. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 6:56)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>On How – or if – Unions Can Protect Against Layoffs</h3>
<p>For many industries, layoffs have become all but an inevitability during the pandemic. In a number of the aforementioned cases, they’ve continued even in the wake of employee unionizing. Ultimately, how much protection does a union give workers against layoffs?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Reckers:</strong> Kickstarter won its union on February 18, 2020. The pandemic hit in mid-March. The company announced that they were going to have pretty massive layoffs in early-April. That was a very difficult time. We looked at the numbers and did see that a number of the people they were proposing to layoff were advocates for the union or union members. That was very hard to stomach. What happens, though – and where the union comes into play – is that the company was not able to just lay people off like that. Especially under the terms that they wanted to impose unilaterally, without any consultation with staff. The difference was that when the company proposed these layoffs, because there was already a union in place, Kickstarter had to negotiate with the group of employees about the terms of that layoff. <em><strong>(</strong><strong>Timestamp: 9:10)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/following-unionization-glitch-signs-collective-bargaining-agreement/">Following unionization, Glitch signs collective bargaining agreement</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On How to Get Started</h3>
<p>First steps toward unionization are often difficult in an environment where organizing is frowned upon management. Many early conversations happen after hours and off-the-clock for fear of repercussion. This can be doubly difficult in an environments like white collar workers tech company, where some employees don’t tacitly understand the benefits of organizing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Reckers:</strong> You can best support each other by getting into conversations with your coworkers and understanding what’s been going on with them. The first question I often get from people is how to first start having conversations. I think that’s a challenge, especially since we’re not taught how to do that. But starting a conversation about what their experiences have been like at the organization or company, how long they’ve been there, how has there changed? What did they want to see when they were hired? What sort of workplace were they looking for? And how can we make sure that we have some way of achieving that?

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On Whether Expressions of Support From Management Are Always Positive</h3>
<p>Management often adopts the narrative that they support unions following hard fought battles. In the wake of support from certain tech executives and political leaders like Joe Biden, the question arises about whether such sentiments can ultimately have negative repercussions for organizing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Redwine:</strong> First and foremost, it’s really important to remember that the things that people in power say do not matter. All of the power that you have doesn’t come from people at the top giving it to you. It comes from linking arms with the people next to you and taking that power and influence for yourself. (<em><strong>Timestamp: 28:27)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ann Arbor-based <a href="https://refraction.ai/">Refraction A</a>I announced today that it has raised a $4.2 million seed round. The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/demo-with-matthew-johnson-roberson-refraction-ai/">debuted on the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage</a> back in 2019, was founded by a pair of University of Michigan professors (Matthew Johnson-Roberson &#8212; now CTO &#8212; and Ram Vasudevan) seeking to solve a number of issues posed by many delivery robots.</p>
<p>With an initial prototype built on a bicycle foundation, the company’s REV-1 robot is designed to operate in bike lanes and roads, rather than the standard sidewalk &#8216;bot. The different approach allows the robot to travel at higher speeds (topping out at 15 miles per hour) and removes some of the messy pedestrian-dodging issues that come with sidewalk use (while introducing some new ones on that narrow sliver of asphalt shared by cyclists).</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/47WNq9u4QsY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Refraction is currently testing a small fleet in its native Ann Arbor. The seed round, led by Pillar VC, will be used for R&amp;D, expanding the company’s reach and recruiting more customers, with a focus on grocery store and restaurant deliveries. Other investors include, eLab Ventures, Osage Venture Partners, Trucks Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Chad Laurans and Invest Michigan.</p>
<p>Another key differentiator is the use of cameras, versus LIDAR. The decision comes with some technological trade-offs, but benefits include a lower price point and the ability for the company to more quickly scale its fleet. The technology is also not easily districted by weather conditions encountered in the upper midwest, though it has limitations, too. As the company puts it, if you&#8217;re not comfortable walking out in it, the robot probably won&#8217;t be, either.</p>
<p>“Our platform uses technology that exists today in an innovative way, to get people the things they need, when they need them, where they live,&#8221; CEO Luke Schneider said in a release tied to the news. &#8220;And we’re doing so in a way that reduces business’ costs, makes roads less congested, and eliminates carbon emissions.”</p>
<p>With this new funding, the company plans to expand operations beyond its native Ann Arbor, though no additional test markets have been announced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon said on Monday it has expanded its food delivery service, called Amazon Food, across 62 zip codes in Bangalore, in what is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">first public update since entering the new category</a> in India last May.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce group said Amazon Food now reaches key localities in Bangalore such as Whitefield, HSR, Sarjapur, Koramangala, Indiranagar, MG Road, Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Frazer Town, Malleshwaram, Rajajinagar, and Vijayanaga.</p>
<p>At the time of the launch in May last year, Amazon Food was available in just four zip codes in Bangalore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Amazon Food remains limited to one key market in India, the company is aggressively trying to undercut the competition &#8212; heavily funded startups Zomato and Swiggy &#8212; in the city.</p>
<p>Food delivery is free to Prime members, while others have to pay a fee of 19 Indian rupees (26 cents) &#8212; cheaper than fees levied by Swiggy and Zomato.</p>
<p>The company, which has committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">investing $6.5 billion in its India operations</a>, said it has amassed 2,5000 restaurants and cloud kitchens in Bangalore &#8212; also referred as Bengaluru. Amazon Food customers can enjoy &#8220;offers&#8221; from these restaurants as well as cashbacks from Amazon, the company said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122243" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="834" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=768,625 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=680,554 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It, however, did not share why it has been uncharacteristically so slow with the expansion of Amazon Food in the country.</p>
<p>(Well, I mean, there is a global pandemic &#8212; but Amazon also makes a number of what its employees say &#8220;one-way door&#8221; and &#8220;two-way door&#8221; bets. Two-way door bets are those that the company has not fully committed to and is just attempting to test the waters before making a concrete decision. Think of Amazon Prime as a one-way door bet. So it&#8217;s not clear from day 1 how committed Amazon is to any new service.)</p>
<p>&#8220;With the expansion of Amazon Food in Bengaluru, we continue in our endeavor to offer unmatched convenience and value while being a part of their everyday lives. Amazon Food brings some of the city’s top restaurants including national outlets and as well as local favorites which are popular and follow strict delivery and safety protocols,&#8221; said Sameer Khetarpal, Director of Category Management at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Ant Financial-backed Zomato and Prosus Ventures-backed Swiggy have established duopoly in the food delivery market in India, with analysts at Bank of America estimating their combined market share to be over 90%. (Uber exited the Indian food delivery market early last year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/uber-sold-its-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato-for-206m/">selling its local food business to Zomato</a>.)</p>
<p>The expansion of Amazon Food also comes at a time when Zomato, which according to analysts leads the market, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">preparing to file for an IPO</a>.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s food delivery market is especially tough to crack because of local conditions. Unlike in the developed markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4, according to research firms. Both Zomato and Swiggy have significantly improved their unit economics in the past year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Antibiotic resistance is one of the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance#:~:text=Antibiotic%20resistance%20occurs%20naturally%2C%20but,treat%20them%20become%20less%20effective.">biggest potential threats to global health today</a>. But Locus Biosciences is hoping that their crPhage technology might provide a new solution.</p>
<p>Based in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, the startup recently<a href="https://www.locus-bio.com/locus-biosciences-completes-first-of-its-kind-controlled-clinical-trial-for-crispr-enhanced-bacteriophage-therapy/"> announced promising phase 1b clinical trial results</a> for their use of CRISPR-Cas3-enhanced bacteriophages as a treatment for urinary tract infections caused by escherichia coli. Led in part by former Patheon executive and current Locus CEO Paul Garofolo, the startup launched in 2015 with the goal of using a less popular application of CRISPR technology to address growing antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>CRISPR-Cas3 technology has notably different mechanisms from its more well-known CRISPR-Cas9 counterpart. Where the Cas9 enzyme has the ability to cleanly cut through a piece of DNA like a pair of scissors, Garofolo describes Cas3 more like a Pac-Man, shredding the DNA as it moves along a strand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“You wouldn’t be able to use it for most of the editing platforms people were after,” he said, noting that meant there wouldn’t be as much competition around Cas3. “So I knew it would be protected for some time, and that we could keep it quiet.”</p>
<p>Garofolo and his team wanted to use CRISPR-Cas3 not to edit harmful bacteria found in the body, but to destroy it. To do this, they took the DNA-shredding mechanism of Cas3 and used it to enhance bacteriophages—viruses that can attack and kill different species of bacteria. Together, co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer Dave Ousterout—who has a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Duke—thinks this technology offers an extremely direct and targeted way of killing bacteria.</p>
<p>“We armed the phages with this Cas3 system that attacks E. coli, and that sort of dual mechanism of action is what comes together, essentially, as a really potent way to remove just E. coli,” he said in an interview.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech&#8217;s role in the COVID-19 response: Assist, don&#8217;t reinvent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/techs-role-in-the-covid-19-response-assist-dont-reinvent/embed/#?secret=ysswavaKuA" data-secret="ysswavaKuA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That specificity is something that antibiotics lack. Rather than targeting only harmful bacteria in the body, antibiotics typically wipe out all bacteria they come across. “Every time we take antibiotics, we’re not thinking about all the other parts of us that are impacted by the bacteria that do good things,” said Garofolo. But the precision of Locus Biosciences’ crPhage technology means that only the targeted bacteria would be wiped out, leaving those necessary to the body’s normal function intact.</p>
<p>Beyond offering this more specific approach to treatment of pathogens, or any bacteria-based disease, Garofolo and his team also suspect that their approach will also be extremely safe. Though deadly to bacteria, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/phage-therapy">bacteriophages are typically harmless to humans</a>. The safety of CRISPR in humans is well-established, too.</p>
<p>“That’s our secret sauce,” said Garofolo. “We can build drugs that are more powerful than the antibiotics they’re trying to replace, and they use phage, which is probably one of the world’s safest ways to deliver something into the human body.”</p>
<p>While this new technology could certainly help treat pathogens and infectious diseases, Garofolo hopes that indications in immunology, oncology, and neurology might benefit from it too. “We’re starting to figure out that <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/infections-that-can-lead-to-cancer/bacteria.html">some bacteria might promote cancer</a>, or inflammation in your gut,” he said. If researchers can identify the bacteria at the root cause of those conditions, Garofolo and Ousterout think the crPhage technology might prove to be an effective treatment.</p>
<p>“If we’re right about that, it’s not just about infections or antimicrobial resistance, but helping people overcome cancer or delay the onset of dementia,” Garofolo said. “It’s changing the way we think about how bacteria really help us live.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the restaurant industry across different cities was massively hit by the pandemic-induced lockdowns last year, food aggregator platforms helped by driving online customers to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.getkoinz.com/">Koinz</a> is one such startup in Egypt. Its value for food and beverages brands before, during and after the lockdowns has bagged the startup a $4.8 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussein-momtaz/">Hussein Momtaz</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-said-496278b2/">Ahmed Said</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahkhaldi/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Acompanies_company_people_index%3BDkf5dpxeRFybMPZ%2Bev8Ifw%3D%3D">Abdullah Al Khaldi</a>, Koinz set out to solve two major problems in Egypt&#8217;s food aggregation industry.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offline and online food and restaurant experience in the country are totally separate. Most food aggregators who deal with delivery tend to focus on the online customer, and there&#8217;s no sophisticated experience for the offline customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the unit economics of the food aggregation industry is quite challenging. According to Momtaz, the startup&#8217;s CEO, the food aggregation industry usually takes about 25%-30% average commission from F&amp;B players for business to start to make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is not because they want to squeeze money from the hands of restaurants or brands,&#8221; Momtaz said to TechCrunch. &#8220;But the cost of acquiring customers and retaining them for the food aggregator itself is very high; that&#8217;s why they need very high commissions from the brands or restaurants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Koinz comes in. The company developed a mobile app for takeout and delivery orders that manages offline customer experiences while delivering an engagement platform to manage loyalty programs, customer feedback and analytics about the online and offline customer base.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="407" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1226 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122070" class="wp-caption-text">Abdullah Al Khaldi (CRO), Hussein Momtaz (CEO), and Ahmed Said (CTO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online food experience for Koinz customers is like a treasure hunt, and Momtaz claims the company&#8217;s business model has cracked the industry&#8217;s unit economics. This, alongside providing brands with insights, differentiates the platform from other aggregators and makes its customer acquisition cost and retention cost 60% less than most of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how the platform works. When customers visit a brand using for the first time, they enter their phone numbers to instantly receive points for their order via text message. After various restaurant visits and making orders, they accumulate enough points. They&#8217;ll need to download the Koinz mobile application to redeem them, thereby converting these offline customers to online ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, these offline customers can now discover new places to eat, read and leave reviews, and order delivery or takeout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;None of the small or big brands in the region had something like this before. The offline customer is like a ghost. He walks into the brands, takes his orders, and leaves without the brands knowing anything about him. Koinz is changing that,&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building its platform this way, Koinz tries to be different from other online aggregators that erode restaurant owners&#8217; profit margins while delivering limited customer access and interaction. How? By collecting real-time data and leveraging a digital rewarding system designed to drive customers to deepen their relationship with restaurants.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122071" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122071" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2122071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Koinz</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can configure their gifts lists and determine what customers can redeem their points for. For instance, customers in an Egyptian restaurant called Buffalo Burger can exchange 68 points for a Diablo Fries Medium; or wait till they get to 160 points to get a Mozzarella Sticks Medium; or 236 points for a Double Diggler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, every brand has its own configuration. A customer cannot get points in Buffalo Burger and redeem them at Hamburgini. Koinz charges subscriptions to the brands for its engagement and feedback platform and collects commission whenever an order is made via its platform, which varies across its markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its original business model, Koinz had to iterate several times. Before using phone numbers to collect customers&#8217; information, the company used QR codes and NFC tags. Momtaz says this was highly ineffective, and the move to phone numbers helped skyrocket its growth and value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-man team back in 2018 is now 80, and the platform, which is basically powering the growth of restaurants in the Middle East, claims to have had up to 4 million consumers earn points on its platform. These consumers have redeemed almost 300,000 rewards, while almost 800,000 customers have left reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in Egypt, Koinz has expanded to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Like Egypt, these markets have similar dynamics and demographics. They have also witnessed one of the <a href="https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/3151/online-grocery-sales-in-ksa-and-uae-doubles-during-covid-19">highest rates of new or increased users</a> in online deliveries &#8212; restaurant products and groceries &#8212; during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, consumers in the Middle East are outpacing the global appetite in food delivery, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/money/majority-of-middle-east-consumers-plan-to-spend-more-this-year-1.977492">with 64% ordering in at least once a week</a> compared to 40% made by global consumers. And with the fast-food industry in MENA was estimated at nearly $31 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach nearly $60 billion by 2025, there&#8217;s so much room for Koinz to grow in the region. Momtaz says the company is also considering a move to Sub-Saharan Africa in the nearest future despite them having distinct demographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur and investor Justin Mateen led this seed round. Since leaving Tinder in 2014, Mateen has been an active investor in early-stage companies. Koinz is his first investment in the MENA region. According to him, Koinz&#8217;s ability to allow food and beverages brands to understand their customers&#8217; needs and simultaneously increase their profit margins was one of the reasons he invested in the Egyptian-based startup.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The company&#8217;s unique business model will continue to scale as the food delivery space evolves. Hussein&#8217;s drive and excitement for what the team is building are what convinced me to lead a round in the Middle East for the first time,&#8221; Mateen added.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-focused VC 4DX Ventures and strategic angel investors from Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia participated as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Orth, co-founder and managing director of the firm, said of the investment that with restaurants in the region suffering under the traditional aggregator model, especially during the pandemic, Koinz has quickly become a win-win for both consumers and restaurant owners across the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the three-year-old company plans to use the capital to hire more talent and fuel its expansion across the Middle East, Mateen and Orth will join its board of directors.</span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Our transportation desk is taking shape. Two new reporters, Aria Alamalhodaei and Rebecca Bellan started Monday and have already provided some new and interesting coverage. Tamara Warren, a former editor at the Verge who has been writing about automotive and tech for two decades, reviewed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/the-aston-martin-dbx-is-a-tale-of-two-vehicles/">Aston Martin DBX</a>. This week, Abigail Basset, a World Car Juror former CNN producer who writes about cars, tech, business — pretty much everything — break down the new VW ID. 4.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re just getting started. <em>Vamos.</em></p>
<p>Please help welcome them and follow them on Twitter and maybe even drop them a DM. You can find them @RebeccaBellan and Aria over @breadfrom.</p>

<p>Scooter clutter has prompted a number of entrepreneurs to start companies, all aiming to solve the problem. Tortoise has its repositioning software, companies like Swiftmile offer docking stations that also charge scooters.</p>
<p>But what about a solution that works across brands? Paris aims to find out.</p>
<p>The city is testing universal charging infrastructure for electric scooters in a pilot project that will kick off in the second quarter of this year. DUCKT, which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6773179827798200322/">was awarded the pilot</a>, will install 150 dock and charge points that can be plugged into bus stations and street lighting to provide the power source.</p>
<p>DUCKT was one of 15 companies that were named <a href="https://urbanlab.parisandco.paris/QIU3">Urban Innovation District winners</a>. Each winner is testing a different urban project in the 13th arrondissement. The competition, which is run by Paris &amp; Co.&#8217;s urban innovation lab, includes pilots focused on food waste, rainwater collection, revegetation and waterproofing as well as several mobility projects. Ezymob will test a mobile app that helps visually impaired people navigate public transit, Mobilypod is launching a subscription-based cargo bike service and bike shelters and the LaCroix Lab is piloting 4SafeMobilities, a system designed to streamline traffic at intersections and pedestrian crossings.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Porsche is taking its electrification ambitions to two wheels. The German automaker unveiled this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/porsche-unveils-two-new-electric-bikes-alongside-the-taycan-gran-turismo/"> two electric bikes</a> alongside the global debut of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, the latest variant to its EV flagship. These bikes cost between $8,000 and more than $10,000 — prices one might expect from the luxury performance brand.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Forget the &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221; How about we take a stroll down memory lane and look at all the deals of 2020? CB Insights, released March 3 its <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/mobility-trends-2020/">State of Mobility report</a> that looks at 2020 investment data and trends surrounding all things transportation.</p>
<p>The upshot: The COVID-19 pandemic did help push total funding down 5% year-over-year to $27.19 billion, although CB Insights saw recovery in the second half of the year. There were 522 deals, a 21% drop from the previous year.</p>
<p>Total funding only tells part of the story though. If 2020 will be known for anything — aside from the whole global pandemic thing — it&#8217;ll be for the incredible number of SPAC deals across auto and mobility. There were 107 exits last year with 22 of them from startups going public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition, or &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. Having trouble gauging if that&#8217;s a big deal? Here&#8217;s some help: there were five auto and mobility SPACs between 2015 and 2019. Five. Electric vehicle companies and those with technology that supports EVs made up 68% of those SPAC deals in 2020.</p>
<p>The SPAC spree isn&#8217;t stopping either with Joby Aviation, Hellbiz and Otonomo are just a few that have reached merger agreements and will go public in 2021.</p>
<p>Electric vehicle tech and autonomous vehicle tech both reached peaks in 2020. EV tech companies raised $12.8 billion across 193 deals, while AVs brought in $7.3 billion across 105 deals, according to CB Insights. It&#8217;s worth noting that the AV industry appears to be maturing — at least in a funding perspective — with the average deal size rising 16.8% from the previous year to $104 million.</p>
<p>Connected car tech and auto commerce both saw dips in funding last year. For the second straight year, connected car tech saw a drop in funding and total number of deals. Funding plummeted 52% to $1 billion in 2020 compared to the previous year. CB Insights said the drop is because connectivity solutions have been widely adopted and investors have shifted their attention and money to other areas of auto tech such as electrification and autonomy.</p>
<p>Perhaps to no one&#8217;s surprise, bike and scooter companies saw funding rise 52% year-over-year to $2.4 billion in 2020. That&#8217;s still below funding seen in those heady days of 2017 and 2018 when scooters won over the hearts and minds of investors. Scooter and bike companies raked in $3.2 billion in 2017 and $4.9 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, funding to shared mobility companies (MaaS) fell 20% in 2020 to $6.3 billion across 116 deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aero</strong>, a startup backed by Garrett Camp&#8217;s startup studio Expa, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/aero-series-a/">raised $20 millio</a>n in Series A funding round led by Keyframe Capital, with Keyframe’s chief investment officer John Rapaport joining the Aero board. Cyrus Capital Partners and Expa also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Boom Supersonic</strong>, the aerospace startup building supersonic jets, landed a strategic investment from American Express Ventures. The funds will be used for the development of the company&#8217;s flagship product, the supersonic airliner Overture.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Fluid Truck</strong>,  a Denver-based app-based platform that lets users make short-term rentals of commercial vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/fluid-truck-the-zipcar-of-commercial-trucks-raises-63m-to-take-on-rental-giants/">raised $63 million in a Series A funding round</a>. The truck sharing platform is aimed at mid-mile and last-mile delivery companies, which use it to remotely manage an on-demand rental fleet via web or mobile app. Private equity firm Bison Capital led the round, with participation from Ingka Investments (part of Ingka Group, the main Ikea retailer), Sumitomo Corporation of Americas and Fluid Vehicle Owners.</p>
<p><strong>Instacart</strong>, the n-demand grocery delivery platform, raised $265 million in funding from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The new funding pushed the company&#8217;s valuation to $39 billion &#8212; more than double its $17.7 billion valuation when it raised $200 million just six months ago.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Darrell Etherington writes</a>: What&#8217;s behind the massive increase in the value investors are willing to ascribe to the business? Put simply, the pandemic. Last year, Instacart announced three separate raises, including a $225 million round in June, followed by a $100 million round in July. The rapid sequence of venture capital injections were likely designed to fuel growth as demand for grocery delivery services surged while people attempted to quarantine or generally spend less time frequenting high-traffic social environments like grocery stores.</p>
<p><strong>Loggi Tecnologia</strong>, the Brazilian delivery company backed by SoftBank and Microsoft Corp., raised 1.15 billion reais ($205 million) in a round led by CapSur Capital, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/softbank-backed-loggi-valued-near-2-billion-in-funding-round?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The company is now valued close to $2 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Rollick</strong>, the online powersports, RV and boat buying marketplace, raised $8.5 million in a funding round that included investors Sandbox Insurtech Ventures, TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Dallas Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures, and London Technology Club. Existing investors LiveOak Venture Partners, Silverton Partners, Autotech Ventures, ManchesterStory, Anthem Venture Partners and Capital Factory also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Volocopter</strong>, a startup out of southern Germany that has been building and testing electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, raised €200 million (about $241 million) in a Series D round of funding. New investors include funds managed by BlackRock, global infrastructure company Atlantia SpA., Avala Capital; Tier 1 supplier Continental AG, Japan’s NTT via its venture capital arm, Tokyo Century and multiple family offices.. Volocopter also said that all of its existing investors — a list that includes Geely, Daimler, DB Schenker, Intel Capital, btov Partners, Team Europe and Klocke Holding and more — also contributed to the round.</p>
<p>Alongside its aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas. CEO Florian Reuter told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flying-taxi-startup-volocopter-picks-up-another-241m-says-service-is-now-two-years-out/">TechCrunch editor Ingrid Lunden</a> that live services are now two years out for the two vehicle models it has been developing.</p>

<p>Policy: it&#8217;s what for dinner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying out a new, semi-regular section in the newsletter that will cover notable legislative activity around electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, public transit and personal mobility.</p>
<p>This week, let&#8217;s head on over to California, where State Sen. Dave Min introduced a bill that would require all autonomous vehicles to also be zero emission by 2025. The bill was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group says it doesn&#8217;t want to see future means of transportation married to the technology of the past. Proponents point out the potential for AVs to either help or hurt attempts to cut emissions.</p>
<p>While the amendment is in line with the state&#8217;s goals to reduce emissions, it also adds a wrinkle to the plans of any AV developer that doesn&#8217;t currently use electric vehicles. Cruise and Zoox, for instance, only use electric vehicles. AV giant Waymo and numerous others use a mix of vehicles, notably the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan.</p>
<p>As Rebecca Bellan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">notes in her article</a>, this proposed bill is in its infancy stages, so there are plenty of opportunities for it to be quashed.</p>
<p>The responses from the industry offered up the kind of political neutrality that aims to placate everyone. My interpretation of the various comments and statements — both on record and more informal on background chatter — is that work will soon begin to modify the language of the proposed bill to be more accommodating to the industry while hanging onto its original intent. That might mean pushing the deadline, adding hybrids and creating an exception for long-haul trucks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, over in the land of passenger electric vehicles, work is underway to pass laws that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/">allow direct sales</a> in at least eight states. Passage of such legislation would clear the way for EV giants like Tesla, along with newcomers Lucid and Rivian, which have yet to bring a vehicle to market, to sell directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Tesla, Rivian and other EV entrants are working together to pass these laws. Industry alliances are not unheard of on issues in which all the parties stand to benefit. Tesla&#8217;s cooperation is notable because it would end its monopoly on direct sales in some states.</p>

<p>Here are a few other stories that are worth sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Aston Martin</strong> CEO Tobias Moers&#8217; <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/why-aston-martins-ceo-confident-turnround-will-succeed?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">interview</a> with Automotive News Europe is a complementary side dish to Tamara Warren&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/the-aston-martin-dbx-is-a-tale-of-two-vehicles/">review of the DBX</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Postmates X</strong>, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion, has officially spun out as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">independent company called Serve Robotics</a>. (Y&#8217;all might recall I previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/uber-planning-to-spin-out-postmates-delivery-robot-arm/">reported that a deal</a> was being shopped to investors.)</p>
<p>Serve Robotics raised seed funding in a round led by venture capital firm Neo. Other investors included Uber as well as Lee Jacobs and Cyan Banister&#8217;s Long Journey Ventures, Western Technology Investment, Scott Banister, Farhad Mohit and Postmates co-founders Bastian Lehmann and Sean Plaice.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> is closing its forums and launching a new <a href="https://engage.tesla.com/articles/14-welcome-tesla-engagement-platform">social media platform</a> called the Tesla Engagement Platform. The move has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/tesla-has-closed-its-forums-to-launch-a-social-platform-and-fans-are-not-happy/">raised the ire</a> of a community of its most ardent supporters.</p>
<p><strong>Tortoise</strong> landed another deal, this time with Albertsons Companies, the grocery giant that owns Safeway and Jewel-Osco. Albertson said it has launched a pilot program that will test grocery delivery using remote-controlled delivery robots developed Tortoise. The pilot will start at two Safeway locations in Northern California, although Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko said if successful, he expects the pilot to continue to scale to other stores in the state and possibly throughout the West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota Motor</strong> said it plans to sell 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) in <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/34860933.html">&#8220;Woven Planet Bonds&#8221;</a> to fund a variety of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">renewable energy</span> and transportation<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> projects, including  assisted mobility vehicles, and increased use of </span></p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> said it plans to launch an electric sedan in 2026. The company said that the vehicle, dubbed Project Trinity, will set &#8220;new standards&#8221; with its charging speed, battery range, and in other technology, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35741685/vw-to-build-ev-trinity-2026/">Car and Driver reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo Cars</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/volvo-to-sell-only-all-electric-vehicles-by-2030/">only make and sell all-electric vehicles</a> by 2030 as part of a broader transformation of the automaker that will include shifting sales online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://en.eatplanted.com">Planted</a>, a startup pursuing a unique method of creating a vegetarian chicken alternative, has raised an $18M (CHF 17M) Series A to expand its product offerings and international footprint. With new kebabs and pulled-style faux meats available and steak-like cuts in the (literal) pipeline, Planted has begun to set its sights outside central Europe.</p>
<p>The company was a spinout from ETH Zurich and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/planted-joins-the-meatless-meat-melee-with-its-pea-protein-chicken/">made its debut in 2019</a>, but has not rested on the success of its plain chicken recipe. Its approach, which relied on using pea protein and pea fiber extruded to recreate the fibrous structure of chicken for nearly 1:1 replacement in recipes, has proven to be adaptable for different styles and ingredients as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;We aim to use different proteins, so that there is diversity, both in terms of agriculture and dietary aspects,&#8221; said co-founder Christoph Jenny.</p>

<p>&#8220;For example our newly launched planted.pulled consists of sunflower, oat and yellow pea proteins, changing both structure and taste to resemble pulled pork rather than chicken. The great thing about the sunflower proteins, they are upcycled from sunflower oil production. Hence, we are establishing a circular economy approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first wrote about Planted, its products were only being distributed through a handful of restaurants and grocery stores. Now the company has a presence in more than 3,000 retail locations across Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, and works with restaurant and food service partners as well. No doubt this strong organic (so to speak) growth, and the growth of the meat alternative market in general, made raising money less of a chore.</p>
<p>The cash will be directed, as you might expect for a company at this stage, towards R&amp;D and further expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding will be used to expand our tech stack, to commercialize our prime cuts that are currently produced at lab scale,&#8221; said Jenny. &#8220;On the manufacturing side we look to significantly increase our current capacity of half a ton per hour to serve the increasing demand coming from international markets, first in neighboring countries and then further into Europe and overseas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will further invest in our structuring and fermentation platforms. Combining structuring technologies with the biochemical toolboxes of natural microorganisms will allow <span lang="en-US">u</span>s to create ultimately new products with transformative character &#8211; all clean, natural, healthy and tasty,&#8221; said co-founder <span lang="en-US">Lukas Böni in a press release.<br />
</span></p>
<p>No doubt this all will also help lower the price, a goal from the beginning but only possible by scaling up.</p>
<p>As other companies in this space also raise money (incidentally, rather large amounts of it) and expand to other markets, competition will be fierce — but Planted seems to be specializing in a few food types that aren&#8217;t as commonly found, at least in the U.S., where sausages, ground &#8220;beef,&#8221; and &#8220;chicken&#8221; nuggets have been the leading forms of meat alternatives.</p>
<p>No word on when Planted products will make it to American tables, but Jenny&#8217;s &#8220;overseas&#8221; suggests it is at least a possibility fairly soon.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Vorwerk Ventures and Blue Horizon Ventures, with participation from Swiss football (soccer) player Yann Sommer and several previous investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to see huge infusions of cash from investors bullish on the opportunity for smaller and faster-moving tech-based banking startups to woo customers from their larger rivals. In the latest development, UK-based <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starling</a> announced that is has closed £272 million ($376 million at current rates), at a pre-money valuation of £1.1 billion.</p>
<p>This means that the round, a Series D, values the company at £1.372 billion ($1.9 billion) post-money.</p>
<p>Starling &#8212; which competes against incumbent banks, as well as other challengers like Monzo and Revolut &#8212; said it will be using the money to continue its growth. The bank is already profitable. In updated financials posted today, Starling said it generated revenue of £12 million ($16.6 million) in January of this year, up 400% compared to a year ago, with an annualized revenue run rate of £145 million. It posted operating profits for a fourth consecutive month, and net income currently exceeds £1.5 million per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starling, founded in 2017, has now pased 2 million accounts, with 300,000 business accounts among them. It&#8217;s not clear how many of those accounts are active: the figures are for opened accounts, Starling said. Gross lending has passed £2 billion, with deposits at £5.4 billion.</p>
<p>Starling said it plans to use the funding both to expand its lending operations in the UK, to expand into other parts of Europe, and make some strategic acquisitions.</p>
<p>“Digital banking has reached a tipping point,&#8221; said Anne Boden, founder and CEO of Starling Bank, in a statement. &#8220;Customers now expect a fairer, smarter and more human alternative to the banks of the past and that is what we are giving them at Starling as we continue to grow and add new products and services. Our new investors will bring a wealth of experience as we enter the next stage of growth, while the continued support of our existing backers represents a huge vote of confidence.”</p>
<p>This latest round is being led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA); RPMI Railpen (Railpen), the investment manager for the £31 billion Railways Pension Scheme; and global investment firm Millennium Management also participating, and it comes on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/starling-fund-raising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heels of us reporting in November</a> that it was raising at least £200 million.</p>
<p>The funding arrives at a critical time in consumer banking. The trend in the UK &#8212; the market where Starling is active &#8212; for the last several years has been a gradual shift to online and mobile banking. To decelerate the spread of Covid-19, those trends rapidly picked up pace in the last year of lock-downs and enforced social distancing.</p>
<p>Challenger (neo) banks have been some of the biggest winners of evolving consumer habits. Using rails provided as white-label services by way of APIs from banking infrastructure providers (another startup category in itself with companies like Rapyd, Plaid, Mambu, CurrencyCloud and others all involved) they will offer the same basic services such as checking and deposit, but they will typically do so with considerably  more flexibility, and additional savings and financial tips, and other services provided to customers (such as monthly financial calculators) &#8212; all carried out over digital platforms.</p>
<p>Big, incumbent banks have scrambled to keep up with innovation, but newer generations of users are less beholden to their brands and incumbency, not least a result of the banking crisis last decade that revealed many of them to be cosiderably less competent and solid than many might have assumed.</p>
<p>That bigger market picture has also meant a surge of many neobanks, and so Starling competes with more than just the incumbents. Others include Monese, Revolut, Tide, Atom and Monzo &#8212; the latter a particularly acute competitor, founded by the ex-CTO of Starling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The clock has officially started ticking on <a href="http://deliveroo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliveroo&#8217;s</a> plans to go public in April. After announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/deliveroo-confirms-anticipated-8bn-floatation-in-london-will-be-among-first-to-use-dual-shares-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a> that it planned to list on the London Stock Exchange, today the on-demand food delivery company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/amazon-takes-a-bite-into-deliveroo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by Amazon</a> and others published selected updated financials for the previous fiscal year, along with its <a href="https://corporate.deliveroo.co.uk/protected_file/166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expected Intention to Float (EITF)</a> &#8212; a more formal document that marks the two-week period until the company publishes its prospectus and, at the start of April, embarks on its subsequent IPO.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Deliveroo is still unprofitable. It posted a 2020 underlying loss of £223.7 million ($309 million), but that figure was down by nearly £100 million from 2019, when it chalked up a loss of £317 million ($438 million). It did not disclose revenues (sometimes called turnover) in today&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>The company said that it now serves some 6 million customers, with its three-sided marketplace also including more than 115,000 restaurants, takeaways and grocery stores, and 100,000 riders in 800 locations among 12 markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, Deliveroo showed some clear momentum in a year where many restaurants had to close their doors and shift operations to take-away models because of Covid-19.</p>
<p>It notes that it has been profitable on an &#8220;Adjusted EBITDA basis&#8221; over two quarters, with underlying gross profit up by 89.5% to £358 million ($495 million) compared to £189 million in 2019.</p>
<p>Its gross transaction volume (total amount spent by consumers ordering food) grew by 64% to £4.1 billion ($5.67 billion) with the run-rate in Q4 surging to £5 billion. This figure is unsurprising when you consider that Q4 represented the holiday period, and additionally the UK market (Deliveroo&#8217;s primary market and its home) went through not one but two different periods of being locked down in that quarter (the second of these is still in place).</p>
<p>It also notes that gross profit margin as a percentage of GTV has grown from 5.8% in 2018 to 8.8% in 2020, with some markets getting to 12%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company remains focused on investing in driving growth in a nascent online food market,&#8221; it noted in the EITF, although I&#8217;m not sure nascent is exactly the word I&#8217;d use. Its drivers are easily the most visible of the many delivery services that exist in London. Deliveroo estimates that the restaurant and grocery sectors represent an addressable market of £1.2 trillion ($1.66 trillion) across the 12 regions where it offers services. In that figure, it says that just 3% of sales are estimated to be online, &#8220;equivalent to less than 1 out of the 21 weekly meal occasions being online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company was valued at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-17/deliveroo-s-latest-funding-round-values-firm-at-over-7-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $7 billion</a> in it last fundraising, a $180 million round from Durable, Fidelity and others, as recently as January of this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge leap that is the stuff that tech myths are made of (with untold hours of blood, sweat and tears, and a lot of luck too). I met Will Shu, the CEO and founder, when he was just really getting started at Deliveroo, and he seemed somewhat bewildered by how fast the startup was growing and where it was leading him. It&#8217;s interesting that he himself hasn&#8217;t forgotten those early days, either, which surely help keep the company focused at a time when there are a lot of opportunities, and therefore a lot of potential for focus unravelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never set out to be a founder or a CEO. I was never into start-ups, I didn’t read TechCrunch. I’m not one of those Silicon Valley types with a million ideas,&#8221; he noted in his letter published in the EITF. &#8220;I had one idea. One idea born out of personal frustration. An idea that I was fanatically obsessed with: I wanted to get great food delivered from amazing London restaurants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospectus will tell us how much the company intends to raise in its IPO so we&#8217;ll know those numbers soon. In the meantime, Deliveroo said that it plans to &#8220;invest in its long-term proposition by developing its core marketplace, enhancing its superior consumer experience, providing restaurant and grocery partners with unique tools to help them grow their businesses, and providing riders with the flexible work they value alongside security.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also going to continue building out &#8220;dark kitchens&#8221; (which it brands Editions); Signature, a white-label service for restaurants to offer delivery via their own online channels; Plus, a Prime-style loyalty subscription service; and on-demand grocery &#8212; which is also shaping up to be a huge market in Europe and the rest of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rimac Automobili, the Croatian company known for its electric hypercars and battery and powertrain development, has gained yet another investment from Porsche AG.</p>
<p>Porsche said Monday it has invested 70 million euros ($83.3 miilion) into Rimac, a move that increases its stake from 15% to 24%.</p>
<p>This is the third time Porsche has invested into Rimac. The German automaker made its first investment into Rimac in 2018. Porsche increased its equity stake into Rimac in September 2019. A few months earlier, Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors jointly <a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/en/press/news/hyundai-motor-and-kia-motors-invest-80m-eur-in-rimac-and-establish-a-technology-partnership/?fbclid=IwAR1DZRsy0vQRCQVufkAiW4nBeLPRz6DaQiTQedv4ZughZIDaxfQ0FMNfCRo">invested €80 million</a> ($90 million at the time) into Rimac.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rimac was founded by Mate Rimac in 2009 and is perhaps best known for its electric hypercars, such as the two-seater C Two that it debuted in 2018 at the Geneva International Motor Show. The vehicle produces an eye-popping 1,914 horsepower, has a top speed of 256 miles per hour and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 1.85 seconds. Rimac plans to unveil C Two in its final form in 2021.</p>
<p>However, Rimac does more than produce hypercars. The company, which employs 1,000 people, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also focuses on battery technology within the high-voltage segment, engineers and manufactures electric powertrains and develops digital interfaces between humans and machines. </span></p>
<p>Porsche is most interested in Rimac&#8217;s development of components, according to comments made by Lutz Meschke, the deputy chairman of Porsche AG&#8217;s executive board. Meschke noted that Rimac is &#8220;excellently positioned in prototype solutions and small series&#8221; and &#8220;is well on its way to becoming a Tier 1 supplier for Porsche and other manufacturers in the high-tech segment.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Porsche has already placed its first orders with Rimac for the development of highly innovative series components, according to Meschke.</span></p>
<p>Despite its continued investments, Porsche said it doesn&#8217;t have a controlling stake in Rimac.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the few industries that have benefited from the COVID-19 crisis is online finance. Around the world, the pandemic has forced consumers to adopt digital banking. Hong Kong&#8217;s WeLab, a fintech company founded in 2013, saw users soar by 20% year-over-year in 2020, bringing its accumulative user base to 50 million.</p>
<p>Facing innovative players like WeLab, which aims to bring more convenience, transparency, and affordability to consumers, financial incumbents feel compelled to reinvent themselves. That&#8217;s in part why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/20/allianz-x-1-billion-eur/">Allianz X</a>, a venture capital arm of the 131-year-old European financial conglomerate Allianz, led WeLab&#8217;s latest funding round of $75 million. The Series C1, which involved other investors, followed WeLab&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/welab-raises-us156m-in-series-c-strategic-financing-completing-the-largest-fintech-fundraising-in-greater-china-in-2019-300973821.html">$156 million Series C round</a> in late 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, Allianz is one of the largest asset managers and insurers in the world with a strong presence and solid footprint,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Simon Loong told TechCrunch during an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Loong declined to disclose WeLab&#8217;s latest valuation but said the number has gone up since the firm last reached the $1 billion unicorn status.</p>
<p>When WeLab set out to build a digital bank, which launched in Hong Kong last year, one of the products it had in mind was &#8220;a new generation of wealth advisory on digital banks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allianz saw what we did over the last couple of years and identified this very interesting opportunity to co-develop a wealth technology for digital banks, so they came to us and said, why don&#8217;t they lead the round?&#8221; Loong explained.</p>
<p>Through the strategic investment, the partners will jointly develop and distribute investment and insurance solutions across Asia. Those products will diversify Welab&#8217;s current offerings, including a virtual bank and a lending product in Hong Kong, as well as several types of lending services in mainland China and Indonesia. Around 47 million of its total users are in mainland China, 2.5 million in Indonesia, and less than one million in Hong Kong, a city with a 7.5 million population.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting four-way cooperation,&#8221; said Loong, referring to the roles of Allianz as an asset management and insurance firm, and WeLab as a bank and fintech solution provider. &#8220;I think it will really be an interesting inflection point for the company to scale.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Working with titans</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2122158" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122158" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122158" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="749" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg 6706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122158" class="wp-caption-text">The WeLab team</p></div></p>
<p>Equally important to WeLab&#8217;s revenue is enterprise services, according to Loong, which are helping conventional banks and financial institutions build up a digital presence. The strategy is not unlike Ant Group&#8217;s effort to be an &#8220;<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/ant-financial-wants-to-be-tech-company">enabler</a>&#8221; for traditional financial players.</p>
<p>In spite of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">massive combined market share</a> of Ant and Tencent in China&#8217;s fintech market, there remains room for smaller and more specialized players like WeLab. To date, WeLab has attracted about 600 enterprise customers, most of whom are in mainland China.</p>
<p>&#8220;[We have] an interesting dynamics with Ant,&#8221; said Loong, when asked how WeLab wrestles with a goliath like Ant, whose e-commerce affiliate Alibaba is an investor in WeLab through the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are businesses where we compete, and there are also areas where we work well together,&#8221; he added. For example, WeLab introduced one of the first smartphone leasing services on Alipay, Ant&#8217;s flagship app that works as a marketplace for third-party financial products and end consumers. But Ant also has its own in-house financial products, which could clash with outside suppliers peddling on its marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, I would say that because we are a rather independent company, we work with everyone,&#8221; Loong asserted.</p>
<h2>Greater Bay links</h2>
<p>As a Hong Kong-founded firm, WeLab has actively taken part in the Chinese government&#8217;s push to integrate what&#8217;s dubbed the Greater Bay Area, which spans the two special administrative regions of China, Hong Kong and Macau, and nine cities in the southern province of Guangdong, including Shenzhen.</p>
<p>An objective of the GBA blueprint is to encourage cross-border talent flow. In a way, the area has all the right conditions to run a fintech startup, which would gain access to technological and banking talents respectively in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, two adjoining cities. WeLab has done exactly that, with a larger base of tech staff in Shenzhen compared to its Hong Kong office which has more finance professionals. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s planning to add around 100 hires this year to its 800-person headcount.</span></p>
<p>Aside from shared talent pools, Beijing also wants to encourage more financial integration in the GBA. WeLab has taken notice and plans to roll out its forthcoming wealth management products first in Hong Kong and later into other parts of the GBA through the government-supported scheme called the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/financial-services/articles/wealth-management-connect-in-the-gba.html">Wealth Management Connect</a>, which allows residents of Hong Kong and Macau to invest in wealth management products distributed by mainland banks in the GBA. Vice versa, residents in the mainland GBA cities will be able to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong is a great testbed, but for online business, you need to subject your successful business model to a large population,&#8221; said Loong, explaining the company&#8217;s expansion plan. &#8220;The Greater Bay Area gives us the opportunity to do so. There is a 72 million population with a GDP of $1.7 trillion, which is larger than South Korea&#8230; Naturally, it is a good area to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeLab was looking to go public back in 2018 but halted the plan because &#8220;we didn&#8217;t feel that it was the right market window to do this,&#8221; Loong recalled. The company was also in the process of securing a banking license, so it decided to work on the critical permit before going public.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously if you look now, it&#8217;s very hot in terms of the equity market,&#8221; said Loong. &#8220;So we are talking to a lot of people. We keep a close eye on this and we are always open-minded to explore the next right market window for us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imaging has long been the primary battlefield on which the smartphone battles are waged. It makes sense. The thing about smartphones in 2021 is that they’re mostly very good. Sure, there are differentiators, but if you spend a decent amount on a device from any major manufacturer, you’re probably going to get a pretty good device.</p>
<p>But there’s still plenty of opportunity to continually bridge the gap between smartphone imaging and devoted camera systems. And today OnePlus takes a potentially key step in that direction by announcing a partnership with Hasselblad. The DJI-owned Swedish camera maker has signed onto a three-year partnership with OnePlus.</p>
<p>According to a release tied to the news, the pair plan to spend $150 million over the course of the deal, in an attempt to vault OnePlus to the front of the pack. Hasselblad has dipped its toes in the mobile market, including a Moto Z attachment, and has created cameras for DJI drones, but this represents a pretty big move for the 180-year-old camera company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first fruits of the partnership will arrive on the OnePlus 9, a new handset set to launch on March 23. The companies promise a “revamped camera system.” The phone will feature a Sony IMX789 sensor, coupled with HDR video and the ability capture 4K at 120FPS and 8K at 30FPS.</p>
<p>Per the release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The partnership will continuously develop over the next three years, starting with software improvements including color tuning and sensor calibration, and extending to more dimensions in the future. The two parties will jointly define the technology standards of the mobile camera experience and develop innovative imaging technologies, continuing to improve the Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. Both companies are committed to delivering immediate benefit for OnePlus users, while continuously collaborating to further improve the user experience and quality for the long-term.</p></blockquote>
<p>The deal includes the development of four global labs, including U.S. and Japan locations and:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pioneering new areas of smartphone imaging technology for future OnePlus camera systems, such as a panoramic camera with a 140-degree field of view, T-lens technology for lightning-fast focus in the front-facing camera, and a freeform lens – to be first introduced on the OnePlus 9 Series – that practically eliminates edge distortion in ultrawide photos.</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see how a company like Hasselblad will take to mobile imaging, though such a deal could be a secret weapon as OnePlus looks to keep on the flagship end of the mobile spectrum against the likes of Apple and Samsung.</p>
