										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primary care startup <a href="https://goforward.com">Forward Health</a> is looking to expand its tech-powered, personalized healthcare model across the U.S., and will use a new $225 million Series D raise to help make it happen. The new capital comes from Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, SoftBank, Mark Benioff – and recording artist The Weeknd – among others. I spoke to Forward Health co-founder and CEO Adrian Aoun about his company&#8217;s plans for this fresh capital, and we also chatted briefly about how The Weeknd got involved.</p>
<p>Forward, which currently operates clinics in select U.S. markets including LA, New York, Chicago, SF and Washington, D.C., has a number of distinguishing features, but most notable are likely its tech-first approach that includes a full biometric assessment upon first visit, and its business model, which eschews insurance providers altogether and instead works based on a single flat membership fee.</p>
<p>Aoun and his co-founders created Forward Health with the idea of building a healthcare business that&#8217;s aligned with its customers in terms of incentives, which is why they sidestepped insurance altogether. That&#8217;s led to a focus on customer service and long-term patient relationships and outcomes, which Aoun says are stronger because they&#8217;re not bound by an individual&#8217;s relationship with their employer, for instance, which is often the case when an employer foots the bill for healthcare via company-provided insurance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The average person in the Bay Area is with their employer for about two and a quarter years,&#8221; Aoun told me. &#8220;So your employer is kind of sitting there thinking, if you get the flu, you&#8217;re missing three days of work – I&#8217;m out some money.&#8221; That means they&#8217;ll do things like institute programs to remind employees constantly to get their annual flu vaccine, and do other things to make that happen like provide on-premise shots. But Aoun says they&#8217;re optimizing for short-term outcomes, not long-term health – because that&#8217;s where their incentives tell them to optimize.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123975" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>But when long-term healthcare programs, like lifestyle shifts that can lessen the potential of truly dangerous outcomes like heart disease and cancer, come into play, an employer who expects you to stick around for a few years at most is far less incentivized to want to fund that. Forward Health, which aims to attract subscribers and, for lack of a better term, minimize churn, actually is incentivized to make those long-term outcomes positive for everyone who comes through the door.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of why one focus with this new funding is to debut new doctor-led programs tailored to treating conditions that individual patients might be predisposed to – like heart health, if heart disease runs in your family, or specific types of cancer, if there&#8217;s a history of that, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got our [in-clinic] body scanners, our blood tests, our gene sequencing – we basically collect on the order of about 500 biometric data points,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;The idea is you and your doctor then figure out which which kind of programs make sense for you based upon those.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Aoun says he&#8217;s actually at fairly high risk for developing heart disease, so there&#8217;s a Forward program that includes doing a heart risk analysis, blood tests, and regular at-home monitoring of key risk factors like blood pressure and weight. Another program for cancer prevention includes measures designed to help lessen the risk of contracting the top five cancers in terms of prevalence — so Forward created a dermatoscope for that, which is essentially a skin scanner to map out an individual&#8217;s moles and skin features and alert them of any changes.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Forward launches &#8216;Forward At Home&#8217; primary care service to address COVID-19 healthcare crunch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/forward-launches-forward-at-home-primary-care-service-to-address-covid-19-healthcare-crunch/embed/#?secret=Anj6kuHrXi" data-secret="Anj6kuHrXi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This builds on work that Forward began at the outset of COVID-19 — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/forward-launchesafarward-at-home-primary-care-service-to-address-covid-19-healthcare-crunch/">&#8216;Forward at Home&#8217;</a> program, which includes sending patients home with specialized sensors for remote care. Another specialized program tailored to COVID-19 actually offers monitoring specific to the disease in order to track a patient&#8217;s progress safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now launching programs for all the top diseases to help you get ahead of them,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;And whatever kind of programs you&#8217;re using, you walk away with plans that are tailored to you, again, to counsel you not only on the potential risks for the things like the cancer and heart disease, but also to be proactive, with guidance from diet, to exercise, to stress, and to sleep, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The programs are supported by Forward&#8217;s 24/7 worldwide care support team, which subscribers can access via their mobile app. It&#8217;s also complemented by the check-ins with your physician via the &#8216;Forward at Home&#8217; in-home virtual visits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123976" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123976" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>While Forward is already rolling these out, it has plans to continue to develop new ones, and it&#8217;s also monitoring results in order to understand how they&#8217;re working for users, and will be sharing that data once it has collected a significant sample. I asked Aoun how Forward can scale this kind of personalized care – especially now that the startup plans to open additional locations in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Basically, Aoun said that Forward approached it as an engineering problem. He argues that most solutions in healthcare see the fundamental issue as a labor problem — but trying to scale that, with the salaries that medical professionals command, and the limited availability of skilled talent, makes no sense. Especially because consumers are naturally looking for improvements in their standard of care over time, in the same way they expect improvements in the products they buy or services they use.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a chain of increasingly specific medical professionals to address individual health risks and needs, Aoun said Forward identified that there&#8217;s a massive amount of overlap in preventative care courses of action. The Forward team focused on breaking the fundamental elements down into what equate roughly to reusable Lego blocks, which can be recombined with relative speed and repeatability to produce a program that&#8217;s nonetheless tailored to an individual&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Combined with Forward Health&#8217;s longitudinal approach to care, these programs and their recombinant nature should prove a good dataset from which to assess how a direct, client-focused primary care model affects overall health.</p>
<p>And, because I promised, I&#8217;ll leave you with how Aoun says The Weeknd got involved in the Series D.</p>
<p>&#8220;He literally just walked by one of our locations, and walked in and was like, &#8216;This is awesome,&#8217; and then asked a friend, who asked a friend, who asked a friend to get connected,&#8221; he told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three and a half years after launching Google Pay in India, the Android-maker is paving the way to tap its users’ transaction data for monetization purposes &#8212; though it plans to give them ample warning, and the option to opt-out.</p>
<p>Google said on Thursday that it will roll out an update to its app next week that will ask users to choose whether they wish to share any data with the company.</p>
<p>Currently, Google makes limited use of users’ data based on their behaviour on the app, for instance, to prominently display relevant offerings. But the company has so far not used its users’ transactions data for monetary purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That changes starting next week. Users can choose to prevent Google from making any usage of their data, even those that are not transactional, the company said.</p>
<p>But for those users who do agree to share data with Google, the company will be using it to make personalized offers. The company said that it will not show ads to Pay users and reiterated that it will not sell their data to anyone and the transaction history will not be shared with any other Google product for targeting ads.</p>
<p>Ambarish Kenghe, VP of Product Management at Google, told TechCrunch in an interview that Google is offering this option to users &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; so that they have a better understanding of what data they are sharing with Google.</p>
<p>Users can choose to change their mind at a later date, and they can also choose to delete records of certain transactions. And those who do not agree to share data with Google won&#8217;t lose access to any of Pay app&#8217;s features, the company said.</p>
<p>The move is not a reaction to any regulatory notice from New Delhi, said Kenghe. And for what it is worth, plenty of apps in the country tap a user’s transaction history to offer them deals &#8212; and sometimes go to extreme lengths.</p>
<p>“We sincerely hope that people will appreciate the ability to easily see and control how their data is used, and enjoy delightful product experiences irrespective of the choices they make on Google Pay,” wrote Kenghe in a blog post.</p>
<p>“As India embraces digital payments, we remain committed to bringing the industry along to ensure that we keep raising the bar to deploy state-of-the-art data security and privacy measures and put the users in-charge of how their data is used.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taavet Hinrikus, the first employee of Skype and co-founder of fintech giant Wise (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly TransferWise</a>), is teaming up with Teleport co-founder and current Topia CPO Sten Tamkivi to create a new investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Both are already seasoned investors &#8212; Hinrikus is one of Europe&#8217;s bona fide super angels, with <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/inside-taavet-fund/">over 100 investments to his name</a> &#8212; and have already done a number of tickets together. The new as yet unnamed venture will see the pair’s investment activities formalised as an equal partnership and be supported by a team of six people based in Estonia, including an investment analyst.</p>
<p>Just don’t call it a VC fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I&#8217;m still not setting up a fund, but am partnering to help do more of the same on the investing side,” Hinrikus told me last week in a text message.</p>
<p>For the last few years &#8212; perhaps prompted by swapping the role of CEO of Wise for chairperson &#8212; there’s been speculation within London’s increasingly chatty venture capital scene that he might raise a fund of his own or join an A-list VC firm as a partner. The Wise founder actually spent about a year as a venture partner at Mosaic Ventures, which ended last summer and went unreported.</p>
<p>“When you say fund, this means other people&#8217;s money and a specific mandate (i.e. invest in seed or late, in biotech or fintech, promise to return the money in a certain time, etc.),” Hinrikus said in an email earlier this week. He also explained that the new firm will not be seeking outside LPs and will be “evergreen”, enabling it to make considerably longer-term bets than many VC funds. Instead, Hinrikus and Tamkivi are happy to hold investments for 10-20 years.</p>
<p>“This structure is both liberating and differentiating, because without strict external mandates we can go after the missions we feel passionate about and be really patient about how long we stay involved in our companies,” said Tamkivi in an email.</p>
<p>“[We] will not be the one pushing a founder to sell,” underlines Hinrikus. “Will always stay on the founder&#8217;s side as we&#8217;ve been in that position ourselves”.</p>
<p>The pair’s combined portfolios focus mostly on Europe but also further afield, including the U.S., Japan and Singapore. Mutual investments (or shareholdings) include Wise, Bolt, Veriff, LHV, Xolo, Oyster HR, Pactum, Starship, Curve, Sunrise and Acapela.</p>
<p>Hinrikus and Tamkivi have also jointly contributed to several “mission driven” nonprofit endeavours such as Jõhvi School of Technology, Good Deed Education Fund or Vabamu Museum of Freedom and Occupations, which they, and the new firm’s back office, will continue to support. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/">Hinrikus co-founded Certific</a>, which is building the rails for home health testing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Dyd5T5U4NY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/">Certific, a health tech startup from the founder of TransferWise, aims to be the rails for certified home testing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Certific, a health tech startup from the founder of TransferWise, aims to be the rails for certified home testing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/embed/#?secret=Dyd5T5U4NY" data-secret="Dyd5T5U4NY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hinrikus and Tamkivi say their new investment firm will back tech companies with a €250,000 to €1 million seed investment, but also has the freedom to follow on right up to an IPO. In most instances, it doesn’t expect to lead rounds but hopes to be seen as more collaborative than competitive.</p>
<p>“In short, we will be doing more of the same: give founder-backing to more upcoming founders,” said Hinrikus. “What excites us most is the future ahead and finding positive missions that improve our future. So far it&#8217;s been lots of future of work, future of finance, but in the future we&#8217;d love to think more about future of health and climate as well”.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a bit more conscious effort to figure out what our theses and strategy will be for completely new areas,&#8221; adds Tamkivi. &#8220;As humans, we both care about longevity, health, education, democracy &#8212; if we find ways how to move these huge problem spaces along with capital, we are very eager to learn&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pair are also willing to take positions in crypto tokens, real assets or any alternative financial instruments.</p>
<p>“On a high level you can think of DeFi as just a natural extension of our broader ‘future of money’ financial freedom thesis,” said Tamkivi. “When it comes to technical execution, we’ve benefited a lot from the freedom to invest not just in equity of established companies, but to also take token positions, use on-chain yield strategies or work with specialized venture funds. Whatever helps our founders”.</p>
<p>To that end, the new investment fund is breaking cover with very little fanfare &#8212; and, as mentioned, it doesn’t even have a name yet. “&#8217;Have you talked to Taavet and Sten yet?&#8217; should work fine for now,” quipped Hinrikus, in his own deadpan style of humour I’ve become accustomed to over the years.</p>
<p>“More seriously, we are just getting started together,” clarified Tamkivi. “[We’re] still figuring out what kind of structure, processes, new talent and other things, such as additional branding, we’ll need as we scale up the activities from our lives as individual angels to date”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional process of buying, insuring and financing cars across emerging markets can be challenging, and it defeats the purpose of building an all-around car shopping experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/">FlexClub</a>, a South African company, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $5 million to improve drivers&#8217; experience in these markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://mx.linkedin.com/in/marlongallardo">Marlon Gallardo</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/rudolfvavruch">Rudolf Vavruch</a> and <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/truzane">Tinashe Ruzane</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is an online marketplace that connects customers looking for flexible access to long-term cars with its partners, offering car subscriptions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same year, the company closed a $1.2 million seed round led by CRE Venture Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ruzane, the company&#8217;s CEO, this $5 million (in equity and debt) is a seed extension round, bringing the total investment raised by FlexClub to over $6 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it will use the funding to improve its technology which protects and limit partners&#8217; exposure to risk.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across emerging markets in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, most ride-hailing drivers don&#8217;t have access to car financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they rent their cars via social media, classified sites, or connect with a car owner willing to rent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was the model FlexClub launched in South Africa, and after raising $1.2 million, it expanded to Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/en/private">with Uber</a> in both countries and helping their community of drivers subscribe for cars, FlexClub claims to have garnered traction but wouldn&#8217;t divulge numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These customers, including those who use the cars for deliveries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commercial members by FlexClub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December last year, the company decided to open up its product to another set of customers who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we first started, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on phase one of our strategy, which came from our knowledge about ride-hailing drivers because of our careers at Uber,&#8221; Ruzane said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to help a community of ride-hailing drivers that had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from accessing cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But right now, we&#8217;ve built the product to work for anyone and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ride-hailing drivers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In FlexClub&#8217;s <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/en/how-it-works">marketplace</a>, cars<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are subscribed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for between a hybrid of short- and long-term lease</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means customers pay an all monthly inclusive fee, and at any time, they can cancel a subscription, switch cars or buy it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to buy a car from FlexClub, drivers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are encouraged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comply with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FlexClub&#8217;s recommendations while using the car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doing that earns them points that accumulate over time, making cars cheaper to buy if they choose to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, alongside the use of banking, credit bureau and identity data, lets FlexClub assess its members&#8217; risk profile and reward them when need be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruzane says last year was challenging for the company because of what it meant for mobility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic, ride-hailing members had financial difficulties. Still, the company partnered with delivery platforms to allow ride-hailing drivers to use their cars to transport goods and packages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that period, FlexClub was also able to partner with large brands like U.S. car rental company Avis to offer car subscriptions on its marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Avis, Ruzane says the company&#8217;s partners range from small fleet owners to multinational fleet operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic made it possible for FlexClub to think outside the box and enlist these partners on its platform. However, it didn&#8217;t come easy as FlexClub has had to earn trust by building credibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the challenges we have faced was that we had to build a reputation to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be trusted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took us two years to get a brand like Avis to see the value in putting their subscription offers on FlexClub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with that established, it&#8217;s now a lot easier for us to continue investing in driving this new distribution model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He likens the distribution model of the automotive industry to how the music industry was decades ago. Then, CDs dominated music revenue but has now given way to streaming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you look at what the music industry looked like 10 years ago, over 50% of music revenue was CDs. Now over 80% is streaming. The industry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transitioned from product-led distribution to service-led distribution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s what we can expect in the automotive industry over the next decade,&#8221; Ruzane remarked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can be an ally to the automotive industry in driving that evolution because we&#8217;ve tested our product in a marketplace with the segment of the population that people thought wasn&#8217;t a good profile of customers to serve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub&#8217;s expansion to Mexico instead of other African countries continues a series of global expansion that has become common for South African companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two factors decided the move for FlexClub, according to the CEO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the founders are from both countries &#8212; Marlon Gallardo is Mexican while Rudolf Vavruch and Tinashe Ruzane are South Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next, both markets have a lot of similarities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the automotive industry works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa and Mexico have large manufacturing bases and advanced secondary markets where brands can lease used cars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya and Nigeria, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have a different automotive value chain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there&#8217;s a growing manufacturing industry in both countries, it is still nascent as most vehicles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are imported</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from countries like the U.S. and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Japan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Tinashe says there&#8217;s an opportunity to take FlexClub to not only these regions but most emerging markets around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is in no rush to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub has been able to attract investors who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its mission of democratizing access to car financing and becoming a global mobility company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kindredventures.com/">Kindred Ventures</a>, its lead investor, has backed mobility-first companies like Postmates, Uber and Virgin Hyperloop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other VC investors include <a href="https://cre.vc/">CRE Venture Capital</a> and </span><a href="https://endeavor.co.za/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors like Matt Mullenweg, founder of WordPress; Federico Ranero, COO of KAVAK; Tariq Zaid, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Shopify and Getaround; and Ron Pragides, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Twitter and Salesforce, also took part in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a presence in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia, as well as two unnamed countries, mPharma wants to increase access to these medications at a reduced cost while assuring and preserving quality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to serve over 100,000 patients monthly and has distributed over a million drugs to Africans from 300 partner pharmacies across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Rockson says that when mPharma started eight years ago, he wanted to own a pan-African brand with operations in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria from the get-go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018, mPharma went live in the West African country. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the health tech acquired Haltons, the second-largest pharmacy chain in Kenya, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entering the market and gaining 85% ownership in the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it seemed like a stretch to the Ghanaian-based company to expand to the East African country as it met several pushbacks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rockson attributes this to the harsh nature of doing business with foreign companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ethiopia is one of the most closed economies on the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has made it a bit hard for other startups to launch there </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the government rarely allows foreign investments in the retail sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rockson, most foreign brands operate in the country through franchising, a method mPharma has employed for its expansion into Africa&#8217;s second most populous nation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company signed a franchise agreement with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belayab Pharmaceuticals is a part of the Belayab Group &#8212; a conglomerate that is also an official franchisee of companies like Pizza Hut and Kia Motors in Ethiopia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson says we should expect the partnership to open two pharmacies in Addis Ababa this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each pharmacy will offer the company&#8217;s consumer loyalty membership program called Mutti, where they&#8217;ll get discounts and financing options to access medication</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This franchising is a part of mPharma&#8217;s growth plans of enabling companies looking to enter the pharmacy retail sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is to provide access to a &#8220;pharmacy-in-a-box&#8221; solution where mPharma handles every infrastructure involved, and the pharmacy is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerned about the consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done is that we enable these pharmacies with our software, and we have the backend physical infrastructure and warehousing,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;They can rely on mPharma to do all the background work from getting the products into your pharmacy and also providing the software infrastructure to be able to run delivery services while they focus on clinical care</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma is one of the well-funded healthtech startups in Africa and has raised over $50 million. L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ast year when <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/">it secured a Series C round</a> of $17 million, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S., was appointed to its board</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She joined Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and Chairman of Novartis as members who have decades of experience in the pharmaceutical industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of backing, both in expertise and investment, has proven vital to how mPharma runs operations. Rockson</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn&#8217;t mince words when saying t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he company wants to dominate African healthcare with Ethiopia, its toughest market to enter, already secured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are issues of fragmentation in pharmacy retailing, poor standards and high prices that haven&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been fixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African opportunity is still huge, and we are still at the beginning stages of privatisation of healthcare on the continent,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://snyk.io/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://snyk.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq1JZDZuQaIdS9a8AgRcM93RyCYw">Snyk</a>, a developer of application security technology, is now worth $4.7 billion after a new fundraising and secondary sale that totaled $300 million.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In all, investors have poured $470 million into the company after this new investment, which was led by Accel and Tiger Global, with participation from a host of existing investors including Addition, Boldstart Ventures, Canaan Partners, Coatue, GV, Salesforce Ventures, and funds managed by Blackrock.</p>
<p>New investors joining Accel and Tiger on the cap table included Alkeon, Atlassian Ventures, Franklin Templeton, Geodesic Capital, Sands Capital Ventures and Temasek.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Withe big valuation and very very late stage investors on the cap table, it&#8217;s likely that this will be Snyk&#8217;s last round before a public offering. And the markets for enterprise software companies have been white hot recently, so the reception for Snyk should be positive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk&#8217;s value and sky high valuation comes from its ability to offer an application security platform that the company said is designed to provide security visibility and remediation for every component of modern applications &#8212; including their code, open source libraries, container infrastructure and infrastructure as code.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Investors seem to believe the company&#8217;s claims and so do a clutch of key new hires including Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-yoshimura-4055/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-yoshimura-4055/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDx75GcLzuX3-0isJzxLyk1hDBYQ">Jeff Yoshimura</a>, a former executive at Elastic; CIO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericahgeil/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericahgeil/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3AMQAms9KsQog_P6n_VN2Er0Fjw">Erica Geil</a>, who previously worked at Groupon; and Vice President, Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) Sales, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunmclagan/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunmclagan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXCkA9FMp9j-v9w8cDsPHN00gxOw">Shaun McLagan</a>, who previously worked for EMC.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the funding, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-scarpelli-1b289b9/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-scarpelli-1b289b9/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGwcDxhmwduZYsaL74QTnPOEAMCA">Michael Scarpelli</a>, the Chief Financial Officer of the enterprise software darling and last year&#8217;s blockbuster public offering, Snowflake, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/pingli8?challengeId=AQH4Skg5DseKkgAAAXfV2MpFVWtEVbvX1iSxPZyz_VitzojRpiuLYmlbQveU65dLjYh4a_688kLVQb6gnT5DCqBbPJyuuSZ_EQ&amp;submissionId=ad85cf22-cbca-6616-5efe-6ec3ebb61811" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/pingli8?challengeId%3DAQH4Skg5DseKkgAAAXfV2MpFVWtEVbvX1iSxPZyz_VitzojRpiuLYmlbQveU65dLjYh4a_688kLVQb6gnT5DCqBbPJyuuSZ_EQ%26submissionId%3Dad85cf22-cbca-6616-5efe-6ec3ebb61811&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxOquWHJZj9NVJXcvFghyaZIjYHw">Ping Li</a>, a longtime enterprise software investor and a Partner at Accel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We first met the Snyk team at the start of their journey, as early investors,” said Li, in a statement. “Throughout our partnership, we’ve witnessed first-hand Snyk’s unshakeable dedication to developer and security teams and their original vision become a reality. We’re looking forward to supporting the successes of Snyk in 2021 and beyond.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk&#8217;s financing comes as application vulnerabilities are becoming an increasingly popular attack vector for hackers. Roughly 43% of data breaches have been linked back to flaws in applications, according to the company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a dearth of developers focused on security means that automation has to do more heavy lifting. Snyk says it provides that through automated remediation and the integration of security features directly into developer workflows. The company also offers real-time answers to coders&#8217; security questions.</p>
<p>So far, that suite of services has meant more than 27 million developers around the world are using Snyk tools and the company also provides a marketplace for security coders to pitch their own tools on the Snyk platform.</p>
<p>“We believe Snyk’s developer-first approach to security is a fantastic tool for developers and organizations today,” said Chris Hecht, Head of Corporate Development, Atlassian. “Snyk has already showcased some amazing integrations with our tools, and we’re now thrilled to extend our partnership with them through an Atlassian Ventures investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Montreal-based <a href="https://www.heyday.ai">Heyday</a> announced today that it has raised $6.5 million Canadian ($5.1 million in US dollars) in additional seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Steve Desjarlais told me that the startup&#8217;s goal is to allow retailers to support more automation and more personalization in their online customer interactions, while co-founder and CMO Etienne Merineau described it as an &#8220;all-in-one unified customer messaging platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>So whether a customer is sending a message from Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Google’s Business Messages or just via email, Heyday brings all that communication together in one dashboard. It then uses artificial intelligence to determine whether it&#8217;s a customer service or sales-related interaction, and it automates basic responses when possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heyday chatbots can provide order updates or even recommend products (it integrates with Salesforce, Shopify, Magento, Lightspeed and PrestaShop), then route the conversation to a human team member when necessary.</p>
<p>There are other platforms that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/gorgias-series-b/">combine customer service and sales</a>, but at the same time, Merineau said it&#8217;s important to treat the two categories as distinct and trust that a good service experience will lead to sales in the feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123908" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123908" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="Heyday screenshot" width="680" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123908" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Heyday</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that helping is the new selling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Desjarlais added, &#8220;We’re really against the ticket ID system. A customer is not a ticket &#8230;<br />
I truly believe that every single customer is a relationship with a brand that needs to be nurtured over time and that will give more value to the brand over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heyday was founded in 2017 and says that over the past two quarters, it has doubled recurring revenue. Customers include French sporting good company Decathlon, Danish fashion house Bestseller to food and consumer product brand Dannon — Merineau noted that the platform was &#8220;bilingual out of the box&#8221; and has seen strong international growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retailers who believe that [the changes brought about by] COVID-19 are temporary are in the wrong mindset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The new mantra of future-forward brands is &#8216;adapt or die.&#8217; &#8230; Brands obviously want to delvier great service, but they care about the bottom line. We help them kill two birds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> with one stone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The startup had previously raised $2 million Canadian,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/heyday"> according to Crunchbase</a>. This new round comes from existing investors Innovobot and Desjardins Capital. Merineau said the money will help Heyday &#8220;double down on the U.S. and scale.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month Jeff Bezos announced he would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">step down as CEO of Amazon</a> later this year, moving into the executive chairman role, while passing the baton to AWS CEO Andy Jassy. Could Marc Benioff, co-founder, chairman and CEO at Salesforce be the next big-name executive to make a similar move?</p>
<p>A Reuter&#8217;s story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-ceo/exclusive-salesforces-taylor-emerges-as-ceo-candidate-sources-idUSKBN2B12C0?il=0">published on Monday</a> suggested that could be the case. Citing unnamed sources, the story indicated that Benioff&#8217;s CEO exit could happen this year. Further those same sources suggested that current Salesforce president and COO Bret Taylor is the likely heir apparent.</p>
<p>We wrote a story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">at the end of last year</a> speculating on possible successors to Benioff, were he to step away from the CEO role. There were a number of worthy candidates, several of whom, like Taylor, came to the company via an acquisition. All the same, we thought that Taylor seemed to be the most likely candidate to replace Benioff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We asked Salesforce for a comment on the Reuter&#8217;s story. A company spokesperson told us that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation.</p>
<p>While the entire scenario fits firmly in the rumor and speculation column, it is not entirely unlikely either. What would it mean if Benioff stepped away and what if Taylor was truly the next in line? And how would that swap compare with the Bezos decision were it to happen?</p>
<h2>Similar yet different</h2>
<p>Salesforce and Amazon are both companies founded in the 1990s, each looking to shake up its industry.</p>
<p>For Amazon, it was changing the way goods (starting with books) were bought and sold. And for Benioff the goal was changing the way software was sold. Bezos famously founded his company in his garage. Benioff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">built his in a rented apartment</a>. From these humble beginnings both have built iconic companies and accumulated enormous wealth. You could understand why either could be ready to step away from the daily grind of running a company after all these years.</p>
<p>Bezos announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">veteran executive Andy Jassy,</a> who runs the company&#8217;s cloud arm, would be his replacement when the handoff comes. Jassy knows the organization&#8217;s priority mix as he&#8217;s been working at the company for more than two decades. He&#8217;s locked into the culture and helped take AWS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">from idea</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">$50 billion juggernaut</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wGH44CNl6B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=wGH44CNl6B" data-secret="wGH44CNl6B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Benioff hasn&#8217;t made any actual firm pronouncement, we have seen Bret Taylor &#8212; who joined the company in 2016 when Salesforce purchased <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">his startup Quip for $750 million</a> &#8212; move quickly up the ladder.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and analyst at SMB Group, who has been following Salesforce since its earliest days, says that if Benioff were to leave, he would obviously leave big shoes to fill. But she agreed that everything seems to point to Taylor as his successor should that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce has been grooming Taylor for awhile. He has some stellar credentials both at Salesforce, his own start-up, Quip, that Salesforce acquired, and at Facebook. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind he can lead Salesforce forward, but he&#8217;ll bring a different more low-key style to the role. And I&#8217;m sure Benioff will stay very involved [&#8230;],&#8221; McCabe said.</p>
<h2>Two different situations</h2>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that while he believes Taylor could be chosen as Benioff&#8217;s successor, and would be qualified to lead the company, he&#8217;s taken a very different path from Jassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Benioff moving on could be different from Bezos in the sense that Jassy has been at Amazon for over 20 years and was there to basically see and be part of most of the story. [&#8230;] But if Taylor were to succeed Benioff there&#8217;s not as much [history] at Salesforce with him not being on board until the Quip acquisition in 2016,&#8221; Leary said.</p>
<p>Leary wonders if this relatively short history with the company could create some political friction in the organization if he were chosen to succeed Benioff. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that this would happen, but choosing one of the many possible heirs that have come via a number of high profile acquisitions could possibly lead to high level turnover from those not picked to succeed Benioff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says that if you look at the range of candidates available, he believes that Taylor would be the best choice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect any issue because there is no one with a similar or even better background, which is when there are problems &#8212; that or when people are in an open competition as it used to be at GE,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know for sure what the final outcome will be, but if Benioff does decide to join Bezos and takes the executive chairman mantle at the company, it makes sense that the person to replace him will be Taylor. But for now, it remains in the realm of speculation, and we&#8217;ll just to wait and see if that&#8217;s what comes to pass.</p>

<p>The new group will be led by Joe Bryan, who was appointed as a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense focused on climate earlier this year.</p>
<p>The move is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-biggest-step-the-biden-administration-took-on-climate-yesterday-wasnt-rejoining-the-paris-agreement/">one of several steps that the Biden administration has taken</a> to push an agenda that looks to address the dangers posed by global climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bryan, who previously served as deputy assistant to the Secretary of the Navy for Energy under the Obama administration, will oversee a group intended to coordinate the Department&#8217;s responses to Biden&#8217;s recent executive order and subsequent climate and energy-related directives and track implementation of climate and energy-related actions and progress, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense controls the purse strings for hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending and is a huge consumer of electricity, oil and gas, and industrial materials. Any steps it takes to improve the efficiency of its supply chain, reduce the emissions profile of its fleet of vehicles, and use renewable energy to power operations could make a huge contribution to the commercialization of renewable and sustainable technologies and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Pentagon is already including security implications of climate change in its risk analyses, strategy development and planning guidance, according to the statement, and is including those risk analyses in its installation planning, modeling, simulation and war gaming, and the National Defense Strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it is increasing platform efficiency to improve freedom of action in contested logistics environments, or deploying new energy solutions to strengthen resilience of key capabilities at installations, our mission objectives are well-aligned with our climate goals,&#8221; wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement. &#8220;The department will leverage that alignment to modernize the force, strengthen our supply chains, identify opportunities to work closely with allies and partners, and compete with China for the energy technologies that are essential to our future success.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you have a meeting coming up, Superpowered will display a drop-down notification to alert you, or you can opt for a more subtle halo effect instead to have it get your attention. You can also configure other preferences &#8212; like whether you want a chime to sound, how far in advance you want to be alerted, whether you want a meeting reminder as text to appear in the menu bar ahead of the meeting and so on.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time for the meeting, all you have to do is click the button it displays to join your Zoom call or Google Meet. The solution is simple, but effective. The startup plans to add support for more integrations going forward, including Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx and others.</p>
<p>The idea for the app comes from four computer science and software engineering students from the University of Waterloo, who previously interned at tech companies like Google, Facebook, Asana and Spotify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123817" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123817" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123817" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123817" class="wp-caption-text">Team photo.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Wanting to build a startup of their own, the team applied to the accelerator Y Combinator with an idea to build a lecture platform for professors. But they soon faced issues in keeping up with their own calendar appointments as they began to conduct user research interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were struggling to keep up with each other&#8217;s calendars and balance all these meetings throughout the day,&#8221; explains Superpowered co-founder Jordan Dearsley, who built the service alongside teammates Nikhil Gupta, Ibrahim Irfan and Nick Yang. &#8220;We would be at lunch and be like, &#8216;Oh shoot, we have a meeting now &#8212; I have to run!&#8217; or just completely miss it altogether,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Irfan had the idea to just put a button in the Mac menu bar to make it easier to join Zoom meetings and soon the team pivoted to work on Superpowered instead.</p>
<p>The product itself is very new. Development work began roughly two months ago and Superpowered <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/superpowered-2">opened up to users just last month</a> &#8212; a quick pace that Dearsley says was possible because three of the four team members are engineers, and the other, Yang, is the designer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123820" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?w=603" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png 1689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=768,866 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=603,680 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=1362,1536 1362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123820" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a paid product offered at $10 per month, Superpowered already has hundreds of users who are interacting with the app, on average, 10 times per day. Busier users, like product managers, are clicking on Superpowered as many as 20 to 40 times per day &#8212; an indication that it&#8217;s found a place in users&#8217; workflows. In the month since its launch, the app has connected users with over 10,000 online meetings, the company says.</p>
<p>Superpowered is not the first to add calendar appointments to the Mac&#8217;s menu bar. It competes with a range of products, like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/meetingbar">MeetingBar</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meeter-fast-call-initiation/id1510445899?mt=12">Meeter</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-meeting/id1017470484?mt=12">Next Meeting</a> and others. But users have been responding to Superpowered&#8217;s sleek, clean design.</p>
<p>The company also has a vision for the product&#8217;s future that extends beyond meetings. After solving this particular pain point, Superpowered plans to broaden its scope to fix other annoyances for knowledge workers &#8212; like Slack notifications, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really annoying to be pinged all the time while I&#8217;m coding … and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s worth seeing because Slack doesn&#8217;t really give me those controls or ability to peek,&#8221; explains Dearsley. Meanwhile, Mac&#8217;s built-in Notification Center isn&#8217;t smart enough to show you just those items that you really need to know about.</p>
<p>To address this, the team is now working on a Slack integration that will let you quickly check your messages and reply without having to launch the Slack app. Further down the road, the team wants to integrate support for other platforms &#8212; like Google Docs, JIRA and GitHub &#8212; which would all be pulled into Superpowered&#8217;s universal notification inbox.</p>
<p>For the time being, Superpowered is $10 per month for Mac users or $8 per month for those who sign up with a team. Annual pricing is not yet available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Actor Terry Crews is going in on the blockchain. With the help of social currency startup <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a>, Crews is launching his own social currency, $POWER.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s break down what that means. Anyone can create a social currency, which hundreds of creators have already done via Roll, to change their relationships with fans and users. Roll enables creators to mint and distribute their own social currency under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 standard</a> and then determine the ways in which their communities can earn and spend that social currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own content,&#8221; Roll founder and CEO Bradley Miles told TechCrunch. &#8220;We refer to this as mass personalization of content. Right now, Roll is experiencing the same thing with money itself. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way I think of it is it&#8217;s almost like the process for earning and redeeming credit card points but minus the credit card company and plus the blockchain and creators. I haven&#8217;t run this analogy by Miles, but I&#8217;m going with it. Just how your credit card provider gives you points for using your card and then you can redeem those points for cash, airline tickets, etc., creators give fans social currency for engaging with their work in a variety of ways. Then, fans can redeem that social currency for more art, content or what have you.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 300 creators, including Crews, using Roll. Roll, which has <a href="https://tryroll.com/roll-fundraise-mainstream/">$2.7 million in funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Trevor McFedries and others,</a> recently saw its <a href="https://app.tryroll.com/markets">social currency market cap surpass $1 billion</a>. Bradley Miles gifted me .10 $WHALE (worth about $3) so I could get a better understanding of how creators are already using Roll. $WHALE is backed by tangible and rare nonfungible token assets, which means that I can use my $WHALE to buy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">NFTs</a>. Because Roll enables users to trade their social currency for over 600 other digital assets, that means I could buy the below NFT over on NFT marketplace OpenSea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123747" style="width: 1132px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123747 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png" alt="" width="1122" height="616" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x9e1f3e8db4d1119894624632499eaed1e56d2b1d/268">Screenshot/OpenSea</a></strong></p></div></p>
<p>However, you&#8217;ll see that the Podmork Pix 35 WS cost 28 $WHALE, so I will not be buying this NFT.</p>
<p>In the case of Crews, he envisions folks earning $POWER via blockchain art purchases, NFTs, physical goods and experiences. Initially, Crews is engaging with his $POWER community through Discord. Folks with 50 $POWER, for example, can access a special channel within Discord. To date, Crews had distributed $POWER to about 100 people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give you $POWER, you own a piece of me,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I want to be very careful about who is holding me, no puns intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for $POWER, but Crews says he eventually wants to offer interest-free microloans to artists. The ultimate goal with $POWER is to empower artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our long-term plan,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;To become this thing that this community can live and exist in. You could use it anywhere you are &#8212; at Target, the grocery store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews attributes his interest in this space to something that happened to him about four years ago.</p>

<p>While in Milan, Crews said he was trying to buy designer furniture from an artist he respected at <a href="https://www.salonemilano.it/en/exhibitions/international-furnishing-accessories-exhibition">Salone del Mobile</a>. He realized he needed extra money to complete the purchase, but didn&#8217;t have enough cash in his checking account to cover it. So he got on the phone with American Express, he said, who told him to go to a local bank. American Express, on Crews&#8217; behalf, then tried to explain the situation to the local bank manager so that Crews could get the funds he needed to complete the transaction. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Crews said the local bank manager took one look at him and said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m watching all these white men and women pass me in line, and they&#8217;re looking at me strangely,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;I&#8217;d been standing there for 15 minutes and it slowly dawns on me that because I&#8217;m Black, I was not going to get my money,&#8221; he said. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;That was the moment I knew everything had to change for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Crews ended up going to a check-cashing place, in an area where he said his Uber driver refused to go, and got the funds to pay the fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing it up still makes me angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I love about this new world of finance is that cryptocurrency does not know what race you are, how old you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through $POWER, Crews hopes to put power back in the hands of artists and creators, Crews explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gatekeeper to tell us no,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crews says he&#8217;s also going to start putting out his own content into the $POWER community, where the community will collectively own it together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is bigger than me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a new future.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Miles, he envisions a world in which $POWER is accepted at movie theaters or at Paramount Pictures properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Social currency] is not to replace the dollar,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to complement [money] and do work that probably the dollar is not suited to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Crews if this means he&#8217;s leaving Hollywood and will solely focus on producing his own content for his $POWER community. But Crews said he left Hollywood when he sued William Morris Endeavor in 2017 alleging an executive from the firm groped him. Crews and WME <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/">settled the suit in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were done with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the deal is, is that I had my power. I still had my talent. William Morris threatened to end everything I&#8217;m doing. But everything I&#8217;m doing right now, you can&#8217;t take. So that&#8217;s when I separated from Hollywood. I&#8217;ve never felt like a Hollywood person, even to this day. But every artist out there probably feels the same way. They want their power.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has challenged the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">FTC&#8217;s antitrust case against it</a> using a standard playbook that questions the agency&#8217;s arguably expansive approach to defining monopolies. But the old reliable &#8220;we&#8217;re not a monopoly because we never raised prices&#8221; and &#8220;how can it be anti-competitive if we never allowed competition&#8221; may themselves soon be challenged by new doctrine and the new administration.</p>
<p>In a document filed today, which you can read at the bottom of this post, Facebook lays out its case with a tone of aggrieved pathos:</p>
<blockquote><p>By a one-vote margin, in the fraught environment of relentless criticism of Facebook for matters entirely unrelated to antitrust concerns, the agency decided to bring a case against Facebook that ignores its own prior decisions, controlling precedent, and the limits of its statutory authority.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, Facebook is the victim here, and don&#8217;t you forget it. (Incidentally, the FTC, like the FCC, is designed to split 3:2 along party lines, so the &#8220;one-vote margin&#8221; is what one sees for many important measures.)</p>
<p>But after the requisite crying comes the reluctant explanation that the FTC doesn&#8217;t know its own business. The suit against Facebook, the company argues, should be spiked by the judge because it fails along three lines.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yDyWjpVjps"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">FTC seeks to break up Facebook, alleging illegal monopoly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;FTC seeks to break up Facebook, alleging illegal monopoly&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/embed/#?secret=yDyWjpVjps" data-secret="yDyWjpVjps" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First, the FTC does not &#8220;allege a plausible relevant market.&#8221; After all, to have a monopoly, one must have a market over which to exert that monopoly. And the FTC, Facebook argues, has not shown this, alleging only a nebulous &#8220;personal social networking&#8221; market, and &#8220;no court has ever held that such a free goods market exists for antitrust purposes.&#8221; The FTC also ignores the &#8220;relentlessly competitive&#8221; advertising market that actually makes the company money.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the FTC&#8217;s efforts to structure a crabbed &#8220;use&#8221; market for a free service in which it can claim a large Facebook &#8220;share&#8221; are artificial and incoherent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The implication here is not just that the FTC has failed to define the social media market (and Facebook won&#8217;t do so itself), but that such a market may not even exist because social media is free and the money is made in a different market. This is a variation on a standard Big Tech argument that amounts to &#8220;because we do not fall under any of the existing categories, we are effectively unregulated.&#8221; After all you cannot regulate a social media company by its advertising practices or vice versa (though they may be intertwined in some ways, they are distinct businesses in others).</p>
<p>Thusly Facebook attempts, like many before it, to squeeze between the cracks in the regulatory framework.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7DxMnuTLGj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/ftc-to-examine-every-acquisition-by-alphabet-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-in-2010-2019-over-antitrust-issues/">FTC to examine every acquisition by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft in 2010-2019 over antitrust issues</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;FTC to examine every acquisition by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft in 2010-2019 over antitrust issues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/ftc-to-examine-every-acquisition-by-alphabet-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-in-2010-2019-over-antitrust-issues/embed/#?secret=7DxMnuTLGj" data-secret="7DxMnuTLGj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This continues with the second argument, which says that the FTC &#8220;cannot establish that Facebook has increased prices or restricted output because the agency acknowledges that Facebook’s products are offered for free and in unlimited quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea here is literally that if the product is free to the consumer, it is by definition not possible for the provider to have or abuse a monopoly. When the FTC argues that Facebook controls 60% of the social media market (which of course doesn&#8217;t exist anyway), what does that even mean? 60% of zero dollars, or 100%, or 20%, is still zero.</p>
<p>The third argument is that the behaviors the FTC singles out — purchasing up-and-coming competitors for enormous sums and nipping others in the bud by restricting access to Facebook&#8217;s platform and data — are not only perfectly legal but that the agency has no standing to challenge them, having given its blessing before and having no specific illegal activity to point to at present.</p>
<p>Of course the FTC revisits mergers and acquisitions all the time, and there&#8217;s precedent for unraveling them long afterward if, for instance, new information comes to light that was not available during the review process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook acquired a small photo-sharing service in 2012, Instagram … after that acquisition was reviewed and cleared by the FTC in a unanimous 5-0 vote,&#8221; reads the document. Leaving aside the absurd characterization of the billion-dollar purchase as &#8220;small,&#8221; leaks and disclosures of internal conversations contemporary with the acquisition have cast it in a completely new light. Facebook, then far less secure than it is today, was spooked and worried that Instagram may eat its lunch, so it was better to buy than compete.</p>
<p>The FTC addresses this and indeed many of the other points Facebook raises <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/facebook-q-a">in a FAQ it posted</a> around the time of the original filing.</p>
<p>Now, some of these arguments may have seemed a little strange to you. For instance, why should it matter if a market has no money from consumers being exchanged, if there is value exchanged elsewhere contingent on those users&#8217; engagement with the service? And how can the depredations of a company in the context of a free product that invades privacy (and has faced enormous fines for doing so) be judged by its actions in an adjacent market, like advertising?</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/embed/#?secret=XQyT4ouxpR" data-secret="XQyT4ouxpR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The simple truth is that antitrust law and practice have been stuck in a rut for decades, weighed down by doctrine that states that markets are defined by consumer good, defined as the price of a product and whether a company can increase it arbitrarily. A steel manufacturer that absorbs its competitors by undercutting them and then later raises prices when it is the only provider is a simple example, and the type that antitrust laws were created to combat.</p>
<p>If that seems needlessly simplistic, well, it&#8217;s more complicated in practice and has been effective in many circumstances — but the last 30 years have shown it to be inadequate to address the more complex multibusiness domains of the likes of Microsoft, Google and Facebook (to say nothing of TechCrunch parent company Verizon, which is a whole other matter).</p>
<p>The ascendance of Amazon is one of the best examples of the failure of antitrust doctrine and resulted in <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">a breakthrough paper called &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221;</a> that pilloried these outdated ideas and showed how network effects led to subtler but no less effective anti-competitive practices. Establishment voices decried it as naive and overreaching, and progressive voices lauded it as the next wave of antitrust philosophy.</p>
<p>It seems that the latter camp may win out, as the author of this controversial paper, Lina Khan, has just been nominated for the vacant fifth commissioner position at the FTC.</p>
<p>Whether or not she is confirmed (she will face fierce opposition, no doubt, as an outsider plainly opposed to the status quo), her nomination validates her view as an important one. With Khan and her allies in charge at the FTC and elsewhere, the decades-old assumptions that Facebook relies on for its pro forma rejection of the FTC lawsuit may be challenged.</p>
<p>That may not matter for the present lawsuit, which is unlikely to be subject to said rules given its rather retrospective character, but the gloves will be off for the next round — and make no mistake, there <em>will</em> be a next round.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, Sun Microsystems piloted its “Open Work” program, letting roughly half of their workforce work flexibly from wherever they wanted. The project required new hardware, software and telecommunications solutions, and took about 24 months to implement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results were </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20281475"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a reduction in costs and the company’s carbon footprint. Despite this outcome, long-term remote work never really caught on more broadly. In fact, the 2010s were focused on going the other direction, as open offices, on-site perks and coworking spaces sprung up around the idea that in-person community is an essential component of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, companies of all sizes, in all corners of the world, were forced to shift to remote work with the onset of COVID-19. While some companies were better positioned than others — whether it be due to a previously distributed workforce, a reliance on cloud apps and services, or already-established flexible work policies — the adjustment to a fully remote workforce has been challenging for everyone. The truth is that even the largest companies have had to rely on the heroics of employees making sacrifices and persevering through numerous challenges to get through this time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best engineering work isn’t done in isolation, but in collaboration, as teams discuss, wrangle and brainstorm through problems.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology like high-quality video conferencing and the cloud have been integral in making remote work possible. But we don’t yet have a complete substitute for in-person work because we continue to lack tooling in one critical area: passive collaboration. While active collaboration (which is the lion’s share) can happen over virtual meetings and emails, we haven’t fully solved for enabling the types of serendipitous conversations and chance connections that often power our biggest innovations and serve as the cornerstone of passive collaboration.</span></p>
<h2><b>Active versus passive collaboration</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those outside of the tech industry may think that software engineers only need a computer and a secure internet connection to do their work. But the stereotype of the lone engineer coding away in solitude has long been shattered. The best engineering work isn’t done in isolation, but in collaboration, as teams discuss, wrangle and brainstorm through problems. Video conference platforms and chat applications help us collaborate actively, and tools like Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Google Docs allow for dedicated asynchronous collaboration, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what we currently lack are the moments of spontaneous engagement that energize us and invite new ideas that otherwise wouldn’t have been part of the conversation. The long-term impact of not having access to this has not yet been measured, but it’s my belief that it will have a negative effect on innovation because passive collaboration plays such a critical role in fostering creativity.</span></p>
<h2><b>The whiteboard</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to think about the differences between passive and active collaboration is to look at a whiteboard. Someone recently asked me, “What is it with people in tech and whiteboards? Why are they such a big deal?” Whiteboards are simple and “low-tech,” yet have become quintessential in our industry. That’s because they represent a source of multimodal collaboration for engineers. Let’s think back to before COVID. How many times have you walked by (or been a part of) a scrum meeting of engineers huddled around a whiteboard? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever stopped by because you overheard a snippet of a conversation and wanted to learn more or share your perspective? Or maybe something on a whiteboard caught your eye and caused you to start a conversation with another colleague, leading to a breakthrough. These are all moments of passive collaboration, which whiteboards so excellently enable (in addition to being a tool for real-time, active collaboration). They’re low-friction ways to invite new ideas and perspectives to the conversation that otherwise wouldn’t have been considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While whiteboards are one mode of facilitating passive collaboration, they aren’t the only option. Serendipitous meetings in the break room, overhearing a conversation from the next cubicle over, or spotting someone across the room who’s free for a quick gut check are also examples of passive collaboration. These interactions are a critical piece of how we work together and the hardest to recreate in a world of remote work. Just as silos in the development process are detrimental to software quality, so too is a lack of passive collaboration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need tools that will help us peek over at what other people are working on without the pressure of a dedicated meeting time or update email. The free and open exchange of ideas is a birthplace for innovation, but we haven’t yet figured out how to create a good virtual space for this.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of work is one in which teams are more distributed than ever before, meaning we need new tools for passive collaboration not just for this year, but for the future, too. Our own internal survey results tell us that while some employees prefer the option to be fully remote once the pandemic is behind us, the majority want a more flexible solution in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crucially, the answer is not to create more meetings or email threads, but instead to reimagine virtual spaces that can function like the classic whiteboard and other serendipitous modes of collaboration. As we all still look for ways to solve this challenge, we at LinkedIn have been thinking about how to encourage cross-team conversations and open Q&amp;As to share resources, as a start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, the tech industry has paved the way for innovations in employee experience, creating spaces and benefits that reduced friction in collaboration and productivity. Now, as we look ahead to a hybrid work world, we must find new ways to continue supporting employee productivity and creativity. It’s only when we’re able to fully realize passive collaboration virtually that we’ll have unlocked the full potential of remote and hybrid work situations.</span></p>

Currently, Roblox is trading at $71.10 per share, up just over 60% from the reference price that it announced last night. That effort finally<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> set a directional value of sorts on Roblox&#8217;s shares before it floated on the public markets. </span></p>
<p>Roblox, a gaming company aimed at children and powered by an internal economy and third-party development activity, has had a tumultuous if exciting path to the public markets. The company initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">intended to list in a traditional IPO</a>, but after enthusiastic market conditions sent the value of some public-offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">shares higher after they began to trade</a>, Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">hit pause</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Na2Ppmvjrv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">The Roblox Gambit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The Roblox Gambit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/embed/#?secret=Na2Ppmvjrv" data-secret="Na2Ppmvjrv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The former startup then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raised a Series H round of capital</a>, a $520 million investment that boosted the value of Roblox from around $4 billion to $29.5 billion. TechCrunch jokes that, far from IPOs mispricing IPOs, that $4 billion price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">set in early 2020</a> was the real theft, given where the company was valued just a year later. Sure, the pandemic was good for Roblox, but seeing a 5x repricing in four quarters was hilarious.</p>
<p>Regardless. At $45 per share, Roblox&#8217;s direct listing <i>reference</i> price, the company was worth $29.1 billion, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79113/Robloxs-NYSE-reference-price-is-set-at-$45-ahead-of-direct-listing">per Renaissance Capital</a>, an IPO-focused group. Barron&#8217;s <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-roblox-worth-well-know-more-today-51615320241">placed the number</a> at $29.3 billion. No matter which is closer to the truth, they were <em>both</em> right next to the company&#8217;s final private price.</p>
<p>So, the Series H investors nailed the value of Roblox, or the company merely tied its reference price to that price. Either way, we had a pretty clear Series H <em><strong>→</strong></em> direct listing reference price handoff.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s performance today makes that effort appear somewhat meaningless as both prices were wildly under what traders were willing to cough up during its first day of trading; naturally, we&#8217;ll keep tabs on its price as time continues, and one day is not a trend, but seeing Roblox trade so very far above its direct listing reference price <em>and</em> final private valuation appears to undercut the argument that this sort of debut can sort out pricing issues inherent in more traditional IPOs.</p>
<p>To understand the company&#8217;s early trading activity, however, we need to understand just how well Roblox performed in Q4 2020. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">last noodled on the company&#8217;s valuation</a>, we only had data through the third quarter of last year. Now we have <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521075435/d87104d424b4.htm">data through December 31, 2020</a>. Let&#8217;s check how much Roblox grew in that final period, and if it helps explain how the company managed that epic Series H markup.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buying an electric car is a big, scary switch for most drivers,” Onto CEO Rob Jolly told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “Charging anxiety is an issue for them, so we’re trying to make EVs as accessible and affordable as possible, and the Shell partnership is a step up from that.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&#8217;t Onto&#8217;s first partnership. The company, which is an “all-inclusive” subscription model that covers servicing, road tax, insurance and charging in its monthly fee, has already locked up network partnerships with BP and Tesla. Onto has been expanding its electric fleet beyond its base of Tesla, BMW, Jaguar and Renault vehicles to</span><a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/02/09/onto-expands-ev-subscription-fleet-once-more/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai, which joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids climbed to more than 3 million and reached a market share of more than 4%, according to </span>preliminary estimates <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-global-electric-car-sales-defied-covid-19-in-2020">from the IEA</a>. While 4% can hardly be considered market saturation, <span style="font-weight: 400;">automakers, charging network companies and energy experts expect existing infrastructure to be squeezed as new electric vehicles come to market. VW, GM, Ford, Hyundai and Rivian are just a few of the automakers that are introducing new electric vehicles in 2021. </span></p>
<h2>A subscription (ev)olution</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://uk.motor1.com/news/353737/91-percent-cars-financed-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 90% of new car buyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finance their vehicles, a transition from a decade ago when the common practice was to buy a car outright. Jolly believes the EV subscription model is going to be the next evolution in the auto market, especially as the UK and other countries move to ban gas and diesel cars and drivers cozy up to the idea of having a flexible, accessible, all-inclusive means of getting into an electric car. Jolly&#8217;s pitch to consumers is that the startup’s EV subscription prices are competitive with premium financing deals, but they don’t include the big upfront deposits or the hassle of having to locate and pay for charging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forty percent of the UK population doesn’t have access to off road parking,” said Jolly. “They’re going from knowing exactly how and where to refuel to being unsure of how charging works. Will they leave it on a street nearby their house or will they charge it on the way to work, or will they charge it at work? That’s the ambition of working with Shell. It’s making the options available to them and making sure our charging infrastructure footprint is as far and wide as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell’s British network includes more than 950 charge points, including Shell Recharge rapid and high-powered chargers (50 kWh and 150 kWh respectively), which are powered by renewable energy sources, and the Shell Recharge and Ionity network of ultra-high power (350 kWh) charge points. Customers can find all of Onto’s participating charging stations through the company’s app or online map, and all customers have been issued Shell Recharge cards so they have fast access to energy company&#8217;s network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell’s move to partner with the EV subscription startup is in line with the company’s plans to move away from gas stations and towards charging stations. The energy giant made its first move in this space in 2019 when it</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/with-its-greenlots-acquisition-shell-is-moving-from-gas-stations-to-charging-stations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Los Angeles-based EV charging developer Greenlots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier this year, Shell also acquired Ubitricity in the U.K. and announced its</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/planning-500000-charging-points-for-evs-by-2025-shell-becomes-the-latest-company-swept-up-in-ev-charging-boom/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to launch 500,000 new EV charging stations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the next four years. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter says it&#8217;s running a test with a small subset of iOS and Android users to &#8220;give people an accurate preview&#8221; of what an image will look like without the trial and error that process involves now. As it stands now, the platform automatically crops images to make them display in a more condensed way in the timeline, where users often scroll through without clicking on an image preview. But that approach has created some problems.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we’re launching a test to a small group on iOS and Android to give people an accurate preview of how their images will appear when they Tweet a photo. <a href="https://t.co/cxu7wv3Khs">pic.twitter.com/cxu7wv3Khs</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Dantley Davis (@dantley) <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1369682375668424707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The biggest one, historically, is that Twitter&#8217;s algorithm that decides which part of an image gets the focus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/">demonstrated to have baked-in racial bias</a>. The algorithm prioritized white faces over Black ones in its image preview, even<a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528"> cropping out the former president of the United States</a> in one person&#8217;s tests.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s automatic image handling is also a hassle for photographers and artists, who generally prefer to have total control over how an image is presented. If the crop is off, that small misfire can be the difference between a photo attracting a ton of attention or getting ignored outright. It also ruins narrative tweets, as Twitter notes in its example of the tweet about a dog who is conspicuously absent from one of its crops.</p>
<p>It sounds like Twitter is also trying out showing more full images in the timeline. In tweets, Twitter&#8217;s Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis said that anyone testing the new image cropping system will find that most single image tweets in normal aspect ratios won&#8217;t get a crop at all, though super wide or super tall images will get a crop weighted around the center.</p>
<p>For photographers (present company included) tired of toggling between Instagram&#8217;s preference for portrait-oriented images and Twitter&#8217;s insistence on landscape crops, that&#8217;s good news too. As you can see in the sample image, the change could actually make Twitter a richer visual platform. That would likely mean more scrolling past images that take up multiple tweets&#8217; worth of vertical space, but we&#8217;d be happy to trade the time spent clicking through images for a prettier Twitter timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m an entrepreneur who wants to expand my startup to the U.S. What are the benefits and drawbacks of various types of visas and green cards? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The ones I’ve heard the most about are the H-1B, O-1 and EB-1A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Intelligent in India</strong></p>
<p>Dear Intelligent:</p>
<p>I’m happy to hear you’re considering the O-1A extraordinary ability visa and the EB-1A extraordinary green card! Individuals often assume they need to have won a Nobel Prize or some other major award or be well known in their field to qualify for either the O-1A or the EB-1A — and that’s simply not the case.</p>

<p>“Particularly for folks from Asia, being a self-promoter is massively looked down upon. Humility is important,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/navroopsahdev/">Navroop Sahdev</a>, a pioneering economist and blockchain expert <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/061-the-immigration-journey-with-navroop-sahdev/">I recently interviewed for my podcast</a>. Sahdev is founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com/">The Digital Economist</a>, a <a href="https://connection.mit.edu/navroop-sahdev">Connection Science Fellow</a> at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a partner at <a href="http://www.nextgenvp.com">NextGen Venture Partners</a>.</p>
<p>She spoke with me about her immigration journey to the United States, which included two <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> visas, an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/o-1a-extraordinary-ability/">O-1A</a> visa and an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a> green card.</p>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of each visa and green card that you listed.</p>
<h2>H-1B visa</h2>
<p>Overall, the requirements for the H-1B specialty occupation visa are not as stringent as those for the O-1A visa and the EB-1A green card, which is why many employers sponsor international students who are on an F-1 visa and recently graduated or on OPT (Optional Practical Training) or STEM OPT for an H-1B.</p>
<p>Because demand for the H-1B far exceeds the annual supply of 85,000, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) holds a random lottery to determine who can apply for an H-1B. (That random lottery is slated to switch to a wage-based selection process next year.)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.arist.co/">Arist</a>, a startup that sells software allowing other organizations to offer SMS-based training to staff, announced that it has extended its seed round to $3.9 million after adding $2 million to its prior raise.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the company modestly before this seed-extension, noting that it was part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/with-the-crv-backed-liftoff-list-competition-and-prize-student-entrepreneurs-get-rewarded/">the CRV-backed Liftoff List</a>, and reporting on some of its business details when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">took part in a recent Y Combinator demo day</a>.</p>
<p>Something that stood out in our notes on the company when it presented at the accelerator&#8217;s graduation event was its economics, with our piece noting that the startup &#8220;already [has] several big ticket clients and [says it] will soon be profitable.&#8221; <em>Profitable</em> is just not a word TechCrunch hears often when it comes to early-stage, high-growth companies.</p>
<p>So, when the company picked up more capital, we picked up the phone. TechCrunch spoke with the company&#8217;s founding team, including <a href="https://twitter.com/maxrosea?lang=en">Maxine Anderson</a>, the company&#8217;s current COO; <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjlaverty?lang=en">Ryan Laverty</a>, its president; and <a href="https://twitter.com/realioffe?lang=en">Michael Ioffe</a>, its CEO, about its latest round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KqnyvWNI42"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">Here are the 98 companies from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 Demo Day 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Here are the 98 companies from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 Demo Day 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/embed/#?secret=KqnyvWNI42" data-secret="KqnyvWNI42" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to the trio, Arist raised its initial $1.9 million around the time it left Y Combinator, a round that was led by <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/">Craft Ventures</a> at a $15 million valuation. Following that early investment, the company&#8217;s business with large clients performed well, leading to it closing $2 million more last December. The founders said that the new funds were raised at a higher price-point than its previous seed tranche.</p>
<p>The second deal was led by <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/">Global Founders Capital</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s enterprise adoption makes sense, as all large companies have regular training requirements for their workers; and as anyone who has worked for a megacorp knows, current training, while improved in recent years, is far from perfect. Arist is a bet that lots of corporate training &#8212; and the training that emanates from governments, nonprofits and the like &#8212; can be sliced into small pieces and ingested via text-message.</p>
<p>For that the company charges around $1,000 per month, minimum.</p>
<p>Arist did catch something of a COVID wave, with its founding team telling TechCrunch that pitching its service to large companies got easier after the pandemic hit. Many concerns better realized how busy their staff was when they moved to working from home, the trio explained, and with some folks suffering from limited internet connectivity, text-based training helped pick up slack.</p>
<p>We were also curious about how the startup onboards customers to the somewhat new text-based learning world; is there a steep learning curve to be managed? As it turns out, the startup helps new customers build their first course. And, in response to our question about the expense of that effort, the Arist crew said that they use freelancers for the task, keeping costs low.</p>
<p>Recently Arist has expanded its engineering staff, and plans to scale from around 11 people today to around 30 by the end of the year. And while Anderson, Laverty and Ioffe are based in Boston, they are hiring remotely. The startup serves global customers via a WhatsApp integration. So Arist should be able to scale its staff and customer base around the world effectively from birth. (This is the new normal, we reckon.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead? Arist wants to grow its revenues by 5x to 10x by the end of the year, hire, and might share if it wants to raise more capital around the end of the year.</p>
<p>Oh, and it partners with Twilio to some degree, though the group was coy on just what sort of discounts it may receive; the founding team merely noted that they liked the SMS giant and deferred further commentary.</p>
<p>All told, Arist is what we look for in an early-stage startup in terms of growth, vision and potential market scale &#8212; the startup thinks that 80% of training should be via SMS or Slack and Teams, the latter two of which are a hint about its product direction. But Arist feels a bit more mature financially than some of its peers, perhaps due to its price point. Regardless, we&#8217;ll check back in at the mid-point of the year and see how growth is ticking along at the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Today, there is a greater number of mature fintech companies, so this could be slowing down the pace at which seed- or angel-stage fintech companies are forming or receiving funding."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re putting aside the IPO news cycle this morning to check in on the venture capital world and the fintech market in particular.</p>
<p>As we all know, fintech is booming: Between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">Public</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">M1 Finance</a> raising competing rounds, payment-tech startup Finix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/">moving to diversify its cap table</a>, and ideas that work in one market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">finding purchase and capital in others</a>, it&#8217;s a damn good time to build financial technology.</p>
<p>But perhaps even with all that recent knowledge, we&#8217;re still missing the point.</p>

The preceding period, Q4 2020, for example, saw 30 fintech rounds across the globe that were worth nine figures. But, to date, Q1 2021 is ahead and is thus guaranteed to set a new record, having already bested the preceding all-time high.</p>
<p>This morning we&#8217;re talking big money and fintech, with a splash of early-stage digging. I asked a CB Insights analyst about what appears to be falling fintech seed deal volume. Is this the result of data reporting delays inherent to seed data, the impact of SAFEs and other sorts of notes limiting visibility into the earliest stages of venture, or just a plain-old slowdown? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Big, bigger, small, fewer</h2>
<p>Per the interim CB Insights dataset, there have been some 33 fintech mega-rounds so far in 2021. For context, it&#8217;s more than 50% more such rounds in Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Via the preliminary report, here&#8217;s the data:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
