										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.justkitchen.com/">JustKitchen</a> operates cloud kitchens, but the company goes beyond providing cooking facilities for delivery meals. Instead, it sees food as a content play, with recipes and branding instead of music or shows as the content, and wants to create the next iteration of food franchises. JustKitchen currently operates its &#8220;hub and spoke&#8221; model in Taiwan, with plans to expand four other Asian markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore, and the United States this year.</p>
<p>Launched last year, JustKitchen currently offers 14 brands in Taiwan, including Smith &amp; Wollensky and TGI Fridays. Ingredients are first prepped in a &#8220;hub&#8221; kitchen, before being sent to smaller &#8220;spokes&#8221; for final assembly and pickup by delivery partners, including Uber Eats and FoodPanda. To reduce operational costs, spokes are spread throughout cities for quicker deliveries and the brands each prepares is based on what is ordered most frequently in the area.</p>
<p>In addition to licensing deals, JustKitchen also develops its own brands and performs research and development for its partners. To enable that, chief operating officer Kenneth Wu told TechCrunch that JustKitchen is moving to a more decentralized model, which means its hub kitchens will be used primarily for R&amp;D, and production at some of its spoke kitchens will be outsourced to other food vendors and manufacturers. The company’s long-term plan is to license spoke operation to franchisees, while providing order management software and content (i.e. recipes, packaging and branding) to maintain consistent quality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Demand for meal and grocery deliveries <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pandemic-has-more-than-doubled-americans-use-of-food-delivery-apps-but-that-doesnt-mean-the-companies-are-making-money-11606340169">increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. In the United States, this means food deliveries made up about 13% of the restaurant market in 2020, compared to the 9% forecast before the pandemic,<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1170614/online-food-delivery-share-us-coronavirus"> according to research firm Statista</a>, and may rise to 21% by 2025.</p>
<p>But on-demand food delivery businesses are notoriously expensive to operate, with low margins despite markups and fees. By centralizing food preparation and pickup, cloud kitchens (also called ghost kitchens or dark kitchens) are supposed to increase profitability while ensuring standardized quality. Not surprisingly, companies in the space have received significant attention, including former Uber chief executive officer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/the-next-big-bet-for-former-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-may-be-cloud-kitchens-in-china/">Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/in-the-ghost-kitchen-race-gv-backed-kitchen-united-aims-to-kill-with-kindness-heres-its-playbook/">Kitchen United </a>and REEF, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/">raised $1 billion led by SoftBank</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The hidden cost of food delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/embed/#?secret=2DG07kvS5q" data-secret="2DG07kvS5q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wu, whose food delivery startup Milk and Eggs was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/grubhub-acquires-milk-eggs--990135cd">acquired by GrubHub in 2019</a>, said one of the main ways JustKitchen differentiates is by focusing on operations and content in addition to kitchen infrastructure. Before partnering with restaurants and other brands, JustKitchen meets with them to design a menu specifically for takeout and delivery. Once a menu is launched, it is produced by JustKitchen instead of the brands, who are paid royalties. For restaurants that operate only one brick-and-mortar location, this gives them an opportunity to expand into multiple neighborhoods and cities (or countries, when JustKitchen begins its international expansion) simultaneously, a new take on the franchising model for the on-demand delivery era.</p>

<p>Each spoke kitchen puts the final touches on meal before handing them to delivery partners. Spoke kitchens are smaller than hubs, closer to customers, and the goal is to have a high revenue to square footage ratio.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thesis in general is how do you get economies of scale or a large volume at the hub, or the central kitchen where you’re making it, and then send it out deep into the community from the spokes, where they can do a short last-mile delivery,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>JustKitchen says it can cut industry standard delivery times by half, and that its restaurant partners have seen 40% month on month growth. It also makes it easier for delivery providers like Uber Eats to stack orders, which means having a driver pick up three or four orders at a time for separate addresses. This reduces costs, but is usually only possible at high-volume restaurants, like fast food chain locations. Since JustKitchen offers several brands in one spoke, this gives delivery platforms more opportunities to stack orders from different brands.</p>
<p>In addition to partnerships, JustKitchen also develops its own food brands, using data analytics from several sources to predict demand. The first source is its own platform, since customers can order directly from Just Kitchen. It also gets high-level data from delivery partners that lets them see food preferences and cart sizes in different regions, and uses general demographic data from governments and third-party providers with information about population density, age groups, average income and spending. This allows it to plan what brands to launch in different locations and during different times of the day, since JustKitchen offers breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>JustKitchen is incorporated in Canada, but launched in Taiwan first because of its population density and food delivery’s popularity. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery penetration in the U.S. and Europe was below 20%, but in Taiwan, it was already around 30% to 40%, Wu said. The new demand for food delivery in the U.S. &#8220;is part of the new norm and we believe that is not going away,&#8221; he added. JustKitchen is preparing to launch in Seattle and several Californian cities, where it already has partners and kitchen infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to focus on software and content, and give franchisees operations so they have a turnkey franchise to launch immediately,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;We have the content and they can pick whatever they want. They have software to integrate, recipes and we do the food manufacturing and sourcing to control quality, and ultimately they will operate the single location.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk said Thursday via a tweet that he will donate $100 million toward a prize for the best carbon capture technology.</p>
<p>Musk, who recently surpassed Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Bezos to become the world&#8217;s richest person, didn&#8217;t provide any more details except to add in an accompanying tweet the &#8220;details will come next week.&#8221;  <em>Updated</em>: A person familiar with the plan has told TechCrunch that this will be connected to Xprize Foundation, the non-profit organization that host competitions aimed at encouraging technological development and innovation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The broad definition of carbon capture and storage is as the name implies. Waste carbon dioxide emitted at a refinery or factory is captured at the source and then stored in an aim to remove the potential harmful byproduct from the environment and mitigate climate change. It&#8217;s not a new pursuit and numerous companies have popped up over the past two decades with varying means of achieving the same end goal.</p>
<p>The high upfront cost to carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) has been a primary hurdle for the technology. However, there are companies that have found promise in carbon capture and utilization — a cousin to CCS in which the collected emissions are then converted to other more valuable uses.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">For instance, LanzaTech has developed technology that captures waste gas emissions and uses bacteria to turn it into useable ethanol fuel. A bioreactor is used to convert into liquids captured and compressed waste emissions from a steel mill or factory or any other emissions-producing enterprises. The core technology of LanzaTech is a bacteria that likes to eat these dirty gas streams. As the bacteria eats the emissions it essentially ferments them and emits ethanol. The ethanol can then be turned into various products. LanzaTech is spinning off businesses that specialize in a different product. The company has created a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/lanzajet-launches-to-make-renewable-jet-fuel-a-reality/">spin-off called LanzaJet</a> and is working on other possible products such as converting ethanol to ethylene, which is used to make polyethylene for bottles and PEP for fibers used to make clothes.</p>

<p>Other examples include Climeworks and Carbon Engineering.</p>
<p>Climeworks, a Swiss startup, specializes in direct air capture. Direct air capture uses filters to grab carbon dioxide from the air. The emissions are then either stored or sold for other uses, including fertilizer or even to add bubbles found in soda-type drinks. <a href="http://carbonengineering.com/">Carbon Engineering</a> is a Canadian company that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and processes it for use in enhanced oil recovery or even to create new synthetic fuels.</p>

<p>The demise of Loon, which assumed spotlight after the project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/07/google-parent-alphabet-looks-to-restore-cell-service-in-puerto-rico-with-project-loon-balloons/">helped restore cell services</a> knocked out by a hurricane in Puerto Rico, comes a year after the Android-maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">ended Google Station</a>, its other major connectivity effort to bring internet to the next billion users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through Station, Google provided internet connectivity at over 400 railway stations in India and sought to replicate the model in other public places in more nations.</p>
<p>That said, Alphabet&#8217;s move today is still surprising. Just last year, Loon had secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/alphabets-loon-deploys-internet-connectivity-balloons-to-kenya-for-first-commercial-service-launch/">approval from the government of Kenya</a> to launch first balloons to provide commercial connectivity services &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/alphabets-loon-launches-its-balloon-powered-kenyan-internet-service/">something it did successfully achieve months later</a>, giving an impression that things were moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>On its website, Loon has long stated its mission as: &#8220;Loon is focused on bringing connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world. We are in discussions with telecommunications companies and governments worldwide to provide a solution to help extend internet connectivity to these underserved areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/spacex-snags-885m-from-fcc-to-serve-rural-areas-with-starlink/">growing interest of SpaceX</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/amazon-gains-fcc-approval-for-kuiper-internet-satellite-constellation-and-commits-10-billion-to-the-project/">Amazon</a> in this space influenced Alphabet&#8217;s decision &#8212; if not, the two firms are also going to have to confront some difficult feasibility questions in the future.</p>
<p>“We talk a lot about connecting the next billion users, but the reality is Loon has been chasing the hardest problem of all in connectivity — the last billion users,” wrote Alastair Westgarth, chief executive of Loon, in a blog post.</p>
<p>“The communities in areas too difficult or remote to reach, or the areas where delivering service with existing technologies is just too expensive for everyday people. While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business. Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.”</p>
<p>The blog post characterised Loon&#8217;s connectivity effort as success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Loon team is proud to have catalyzed an ecosystem of organizations working on providing connectivity from the stratosphere. The world needs a layered approach to connectivity — terrestrial, stratospheric, and space-based — because each layer is suited to different parts of the problem. In this area, Loon has made a number of important technical contributions,&#8221; wrote Westgarth.</p>
<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>In a separate blog post, the firm <a href="https://blog.x.company/loons-final-flight-e9d699123a96">said</a> it had pledged a fund of $10 million to support nonprofits and businesses focussed on connectivity, internet, entrepreneurship and education in Kenya.</p>
<p>Alphabet also plans to take some of Loon&#8217;s technology forward and share what it learned from this moonshot idea with others.</p>
<p>Additionally, &#8220;some of Loon’s technology — like the high bandwidth (20Gbps+) optical communication links that were first used to beam a connection between balloons bopping in the stratosphere — already lives on in <a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/">Project Taara</a>. This team is currently working with partners in Sub-Saharan Africa to bring affordable, high-speed internet to unconnected and under-connected communities starting in Kenya,&#8221; the firm said.</p>
<p>Scores of firms including Google and Facebook have visibly scaled down several of their connectivity efforts in recent years after many developing nations such as India that they targeted solved their internet problems on their own.</p>
<p>It has also become clear that subsidizing internet access to hundreds of millions of potential users is perhaps not the most sustainable way to acquire customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forhims.com/">Hims</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.forhers.com/">Hers</a>, a San Francisco-based telehealth startup that sells sexual wellness and other health products and services to millennials, began trading publicly today on the NYSE after completing a reverse merger with the blank-check company Oaktree Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>Its shares slipped a bit, ending the day down 5% from where they started, but the company, which was founded in 2017 and now claims nearly 300,000 paying subscribers for its various offerings, has never been focused on a splashy headline about its first-day performance, co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum told us earlier today.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Dudum says that while Hims might have once imagined a traditional IPO, it decided to go the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) route because of their pricing mechanisms and because it was approached by a SPAC led by renowned money manager <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/people/bio/howard-marks">Howard Marks</a>, the founder of the global alternative investment firm Oaktree Capital Management. (&#8220;We fell in love with the Oaktree team and the capital market experience and deep resources they have.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Dudum about that SPAC&#8217;s structure; the lockups involved now that Hims&#8217; shares are trading; and how much of the business still centers around one of its first offerings, which was a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/life-could-grow-easier-for-men-for-two-reasons-and-startups-and-investors-are-on-it/">generic version</a> of erectile dysfunction pills. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re a Bay Area-based company selling to a mostly U.S. audience. How are you thinking about expanding that footprint geographically?</strong></p>
<p>AD: We do have a small operation selling in the U.K.; we&#8217;re getting our feet wet in that market and building out a team and infrastructure and fulfillment. If you look at the regulatory landscape, there&#8217;s a huge amount of room [to grow] in Europe, Australia, Canada, the Middle East and Asia, and so in that order, we&#8217;ll start to [move into those markets].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is your average customer cost? </strong></p>
<p>AD: It has come down from $200 when we first launched, to roughly $100 last year, and we make, on average, close to $300 in the first couple of years in terms of a patient’s lifetime value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How quickly do customers churn?</strong></p>
<p>AD: We break down lifetime value projections by quarter cohorts, and quarter over quarter, year over year, we&#8217;re monetizing each of these cohorts better, with high-margin profiles.</p>
<p>As of last quarter, the business was growing 90% year-over-year, with 76% gross margins and greater cash efficiency, and that&#8217;s because as we provide more offerings, there is more cross-purchasing. Also, word of mouth is becoming more of a dynamic, with more than 50% of the traffic to the site free at this point because we have built a brand with a young demographic.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When are you projecting that you&#8217;ll turn profitable?</strong></p>
<p>AD: We’ve reduced our annual burn and increased our margin efficiency and organic growth, so on a quarterly basis, we think in the next couple of years is a real possibility.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Hims&#8217; first wellness offerings included pills for male pattern hair loss and erectile dysfunction. How much revenue does that ED business account for?</strong></p>
<p>AD: What we&#8217;ve disclosed is that roughly half [of our revenue] is that sexual health category &#8212; which includes [medicines for] generic erectile dysfunction, birth control, STDs, UTIs and premature ejaculation. The other half is predominately dermatology, including hair care [to address hair loss] and acne, and we&#8217;ve more recently moved into primary care and behavioral health.</p>
<p><strong>TC: For retail investors, how do you differentiate the business from that of your rival Ro, which heavily promotes its ED products?</strong></p>
<p>AD: There are a number of core differences between us and public and private players. First is our real focus on diversifying our offerings. With our focus on sexual health, dermatology, primary care and behavioral health, it&#8217;s in our DNA to quickly expand into new businesses.</p>
<p>We also think we&#8217;re different from most [rivals] in that we really invest time in building deep relationships with [those who represent] the future of healthcare markets &#8212; people in their teens, 20s and 30s. This demographic has a different set of tech expectations and consumer expectations than people in their 40s, 50s and 60s, and if we want to build for the future, that means building for the largest body of payers in the future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hims launches group therapy services as first foray into broader mental health initiative&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/hims-launches-group-therapy-services-as-first-foray-into-broader-mental-health-initiative/embed/#?secret=9GGCTafkny" data-secret="9GGCTafkny" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Traditional healthcare companies monetize only the sick, but optimizing around that demographic precludes you from understanding what the next generation really needs and wants. I&#8217;ve never seen such a divergence between a patient population and legacy experience, and that’s a real advantage to us as a business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Hims just went public through a SPAC in a deal that gives the company around $280 million in cash &#8212; $205 million of that from Oaktree&#8217;s blank-check company and another $75 million through a private placement deal. How much runway does that give you?</strong></p>
<p>AD: The company doesn&#8217;t burn a tremendous amount &#8212; between $10 million and $20 million a year &#8212; so a relatively long runway if we keep operating the business as is. But it does allow us to expand and grow into new businesses, too, including into big categories like sleep, infertility, diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What about acquisitions?</strong></p>
<p>AD: We&#8217;ll keep an eye open for strategic opportunities and consolidation opportunities. More than a dozen businesses a month come to us to be consolidated into the brand, but generally speaking, we&#8217;ve had the belief that so much is in front of us that we don&#8217;t want to be distracted.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there a lockup period for anyone?</strong></p>
<p>AD: There&#8217;s a traditional lockup for executives and employees and the <a href="https://investors.forhims.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx">board</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did your SPAC sponsors get a board seat?</strong></p>
<p>AD: No.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much do they now own of the company, and can they sell?</strong></p>
<p>AD: Oaktree owns a couple percent and [the syndicate they brought to do the private placement] [owns] 12%. But the very reason we went with them was the quality of the team and the organization . . . and they have the added incentive for the next year or two from a compensation standpoint for the company to succeed and to prove [out their thesis that Hims is a smart investment].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you think the traditional IPO process is broken?</strong></p>
<p>AD: The traditional IPO market hasn&#8217;t changed. It takes 12 to 18 months of preparation, which is a crazy amount of time for management to be distracted, then there&#8217;s this one-day PIPE that gives institutions a tremendous amount of money instantaneously. Maybe it makes for a good CNBC headline, but at tremendous cost to the company. It&#8217;s atrocious. If you were a founder or employee and getting diluted twice as much as you have to be, you&#8217;d be really upset. It&#8217;s no surprise to me that founders like myself are looking at other modalities with better pricing and better structures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new report suggests there&#8217;s a pricey Apple VR headset in the works, Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board will examine one of the social network&#8217;s most consequential decisions and we review the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. This is your Daily Crunch for January 21, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Apple might be working on a VR headset</strong></p>
<p>Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/apple-said-to-be-working-a-high-priced-standalone-vr-headset-as-debut-mixed-reality-product/">developing a standalone virtual reality headset</a> that could debut in 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The headset is supposed to include a processor more powerful than the M1 chip currently included in the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And it would cost more than most competing products (so possibly in the $1,000 range or more).</p>
<p>It sounds, in other words, like this is meant to be a specialist product, perhaps paving the way for a more mass-market device later.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">Facebook’s Oversight Board will review the decision to suspend Trump</a> — Facebook VP Nick Clegg called the circumstances around Trump’s suspension an “unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/youtube-launches-hashtag-landing-pages-to-all-users/">YouTube launches hashtag landing pages to all users</a> — The company has been quietly working on a new feature that allows users to discover content using hashtags.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A couple of months ago at CNBC’s Transform conference, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">painted a picture of a company</a> in the midst of a transformation. He said that he wanted to take advantage of IBM’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">$34 billion 2018 Red Hat acquisition</a> to help customers manage a growing hybrid cloud world, while using artificial intelligence to drive efficiency.</p>
<p>It seems like a sound enough approach. But instead of the new strategy acting as a big growth engine, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005929/en/IBM-Reports-2020-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results">IBM’s earnings today</a> showed that its cloud and cognitive software revenues were down 4.5% to $6.8 billion. Meanwhile cognitive applications &#8212; where you find AI incomes &#8212; were flat.</p>
<p>If Krishna was looking for a silver lining, perhaps he could take solace in the fact that Red Hat itself performed well, with revenue up 18% compared to the year-ago period, according to the company. But overall the company&#8217;s revenue declined for the fourth straight quarter, leaving the executive in much the same position <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/">as his predecessor Ginni Rometty</a>, who led IBM during 22 straight quarters of revenue losses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Krishna laid out his strategy in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">November, telling CNBC</a>, &#8220;The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey.&#8221; So far the approach is simply not generating the growth Krishna expected.</p>
<p>The company is also in the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">spinning out its legacy managed infrastructure services division</a>, which, as Krishna said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">in the same November interview,</a> should allow Big Blue to concentrate more on its new strategy. &#8220;With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s certainly too soon to say his transformation strategy has failed, the results aren&#8217;t there yet, and IBM’s falling top line has to be as frustrating to Krishna as it was to Rometty. If you guide the company toward more modern technologies and away from the legacy ones, at some point you should start seeing results, but so far that has not been the case for either leader.</p>
<p>Krishna continued to build on this vision at the end of last year by buying some additional pieces like cloud applications performance monitoring company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">Instana</a> and hybrid cloud <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/ibm-snags-nordcloud-to-add-multi-cloud-consulting-expertise/">consulting firm Nordcloud</a>. He did so to build a broader portfolio of hybrid cloud services to make IBM more of a one-stop shop for these services.</p>
<p>As retired NFL football coach Bill Parcells used to say, referring to his poorly performing teams, &#8220;you are what your record says you are.&#8221; Right now IBM&#8217;s record continues to trend in the wrong direction. While it&#8217;s making some gains with Red Hat leading the way, it&#8217;s simply not enough to offset the losses, and something needs to change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has denied an attempt by conservative social network Parler to force Amazon to host it on AWS. As expected by most who read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">Parler&#8217;s ramshackle legal arguments</a>, the court found nothing in the lawsuit that could justify intervention, only &#8220;faint and factually inaccurate speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the order, filed in the Western Washington U.S. District Court, Judge Barbara Rothstein explained how little Parler actually brought to the table to support its allegations that Amazon and Twitter were engaged in antitrust collusion and that AWS had broken its contract.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZjaJp3alMt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">Parler sues Amazon, leveling far-fetched antitrust allegations</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler sues Amazon, leveling far-fetched antitrust allegations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/embed/#?secret=ZjaJp3alMt" data-secret="ZjaJp3alMt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On the question of antitrust, Parler fell far short of demonstrating anything at all, let alone collusion in breach of the Sherman Act.</p>
<blockquote><p>The evidence it has submitted in support of the claim is both dwindlingly slight, and disputed by AWS. Importantly, Parler has submitted no evidence that AWS and Twitter acted together intentionally — or even at all — in restraint of trade.</p>
<p>… Indeed, Parler has failed to do more than raise the specter of preferential treatment of Twitter by AWS.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon had explained in its filing that not only does AWS not even host Twitter yet, though there are plans to do so, but that there are strict rules in place to prevent discussing one client with another. This was more than enough to dispute Parler&#8217;s flimsy claim, Rothstein noted.</p>
<p>On breach of contract, Parler had in the course of its argument essentially admitted to breach of contract on its end, but said that Amazon had broken its side of the bargain by not giving it 30 days to fix the problem as stipulated in the customer service agreement (CSA) at Section 7.2(b)(i). Turns out that doesn&#8217;t even matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Parler fails to acknowledge, let alone dispute, that Section 7.2(b)(ii) — the provision immediately following — authorizes AWS to terminate the Agreement &#8220;immediately upon notice&#8221; and without providing any opportunity to cure …</p></blockquote>
<p>So the 30-day agreement was never in play if Amazon didn&#8217;t want it to be; one imagines that the clause is for less immediately concerning causes for action. Contract breach argument denied.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s allegation that Amazon was &#8220;motivated by political animus&#8221; likewise holds no water, according to the judge.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parler has failed to allege basic facts that would support several elements of this claim. Most fatally, as discussed above, it has failed to raise more than the scantest speculation that AWS&#8217;s actions were taken for an improper purpose or by improper means … To the contrary, the evidence at this point suggests that AWS&#8217;s termination of the CSA was in response to Parler&#8217;s material breach.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company also made the argument that it would suffer &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; if AWS services were not restored, and in fact Rothstein had no reason to doubt Parler&#8217;s claims that it may face &#8220;extinction&#8221; as a result of these circumstances. Except that &#8220;Parler&#8217;s claims to irreparable harm are substantially diminished by its admission &#8216;that much of that harm would be compensable by damages.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, money would fix it — which means it isn&#8217;t exactly <em>irreparable</em>.</p>
<p>On other legalities and technicalities, Rothstein finds that Parler makes no case or that Amazon&#8217;s case is much stronger — for instance, that being forced to host violent and hateful content would damage AWS&#8217;s reputation, perhaps even irreparably.</p>
<p>As is important to note in cases like this, the judge is not ruling on the merits of the whole case, only on the arguments and evidence presented in the request for an injunction to restore services while the case proceeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, the Court is not dismissing Parler&#8217;s substantive underlying claims at this time&#8221; — which is to say that it is not dismissing the substance of the claims, nor asserting that they have substance. But Parler &#8220;has fallen far short&#8221; of demonstrating what it needs to in order to justify a legal intervention of that type.</p>
<p>The case will proceed to its next date, if indeed Parler has not faced the &#8220;extinction&#8221; it warned of by then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Decades ago, a software program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_(software)">Trillian</a> introduced a way for internet users to interact with multiple IM networks, like ICQ, AIM and MSN Messenger, in a single window. Now, Pebble founder and Y Combinator Partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/">Eric Migicovsky</a> is revisiting this concept, but this time with a focus on centralizing access to modern-day chat applications. Through the newly launched app, <a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/">Beeper</a>, users can connect with 15 different messaging services, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Instagram and Twitter DMs, Messenger, Skype, Hangouts and others &#8212; even, through a few tricks, iMessage.</p>
<p>Migicovsky says he first came up with the idea for a universal chat app while working on the smartwatch pioneer Pebble, before its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/fitbit-pebble-acquisition/">acquisition</a> by Fitbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really wanted Pebble to be able to send iMessages, but we could never figure out a way to do it because there&#8217;s no API for iMessage,&#8221; he explains. But the idea for Beeper came to a head two years ago when he learned about a protocol called <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>. &#8220;All of Beeper is built on top of Matrix, which is this open-source federated, encrypted messaging protocol,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Migicovsky describes Matrix as mostly &#8220;a hacker thing,&#8221; but believes it&#8217;s starting to take off among developers. Basically, Matrix offers an API that allows developers to connect with other chat networks using a &#8220;bridge,&#8221; which relays the messages back and forth from one side to another.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I learned about that, I was like &#8216;Hey, we could build Trillion using Matrix,'&#8221; Migicovsky says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099222" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099222" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2099222" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="634" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?resize=300,280 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?resize=768,716 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?resize=680,634 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beeper-diagram.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099222" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beeper</p></div></p>
<p>Migicovsky began to work on Beeper as a side project with <a href="https://twitter.com/tulir293">Tulir Asokan</a>, a Matrix contributor he met in a Matrix chat room.</p>
<p>To make Beeper (previously called Nova) work with all the different chat apps, they had to build these connecting &#8220;bridges.&#8221; This code is also open-sourced and available at <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova">Gitlab.com/Nova</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s really important for people to know what code they&#8217;re running &#8212; so it&#8217;s all open source. People can inspect it,&#8221; notes Migicovsky.</p>
<p>Because of this, people also don&#8217;t have to pay Beeper the $10 per month it&#8217;s charging for access to the service. If they know what they&#8217;re doing, they can just run the bridges on their own servers, if they choose.</p>
<p>While every messaging platform has its own unique setup in Beeper, making iMessage work was the most complicated. And the workaround here is somewhat involved, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>Beeper actually ships its users an old, jailbroken iPhone (iPhone 4S, because it&#8217;s cheap) to serve as the bridge. The code installed on the iPhone reads and writes to the database file where your iMessages are stored. The iPhone encrypts the messages with your own private key and then sends it over the Beeper network. This means Beeper, the company, can&#8217;t read your messages, Migicovsky says.</p>
<p>This process allows Android, Windows and Linux users to use iMessage. But it&#8217;s not the only way Beeper can make iMessages work. Mac users with an always-on device can instead choose to install a Beeper Mac app to work as the bridge.</p>
<p>Migicovsky says he&#8217;s not afraid of any shutdown attempts or litigation by Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they going to do?,&#8221; he asks, rhetorically.</p>
<p>Even if Apple somehow stopped Beeper from providing jailbroken iPhones to users, the company could redirect their customers to acquire their own old iPhones from Craigslist instead. Meanwhile, the software itself is open source and running on an iPhone at the user&#8217;s house &#8212; so Beeper isn&#8217;t really &#8220;hacking&#8221; into iMessage itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think given the current climate of messaging freedom &#8212; I think it would be insane for Apple to start picking a fight with their own users,&#8221; Migicovsky adds. Plus, he notes that the European Commission is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">working</a> on draft legislation similar to the GDPR that mandates all companies to open up messaging for other platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that passes, they legally won&#8217;t be able to block people from doing something like Beeper,&#8221; Migicovsky notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099244" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099244" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2099244 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.17.25-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beeper</p></div></p>
<p>Beeper, of course, is not the first or only startup focused on trying to break through the iMessage lockdown. Other apps have tried to do this in the past, like <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/">AirMessage</a> or <a href="https://wemessageapp.com/">weMessage</a>, for example. They have only seen limited adoption, however. And Beeper is not the only startup to try to centralize chat applications, either &#8212; <a href="https://texts.com/?">Texts.com</a> is developing a similar system.</p>
<p>That said, signups for Beeper were bigger than Migicovsky expected, he says, though declined to share the details. He says Beeper is slowly onboarding users as a result. (For that reason, we have not been able to actually use Beeper. We can&#8217;t speak to its claims or usability.)</p>
<p>Despite the competition, where Beeper may have an advantage is in understanding what makes for a great user experience. Pebble, after all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207152451/https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/">sold</a> over 2 million watches.</p>
<p>Today, Beeper promises features like search, snoozing, archiving, and reminders, and works across MacOS, Windows, Linux&#x200d;, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Longer term, Migicovsky envisions a platform that could do more than just text and share media, stickers and emoji, like other chat apps. Instead, the team is building a platform that would allow people to build more tools and apps on top of Beeper &#8212; a system sort of like Gmail&#8217;s plugins. For example, there could be tools that would let users schedule calendar events from within their chats. Or perhaps a tool could help you see all the most recent messages you&#8217;ve had with a particular user across different platforms, like <a href="https://clearbit.com/">Clearbit</a>.</p>
<p>Migicovsky declined also to detail how the work on Beeper is being financed but when asked if Beeper could be the next step for him &#8212; as in, a new company to work on &#8212; he replied, &#8220;possibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m enjoying my time at YC. It is fantastic. I was just inspired by all the companies that I work with to do this. Part of being VC is talking to all these founders who are building cool stuff and launching it. And I got a little bit jealous,&#8221; he admits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, <a href="https://www.solugentech.com/">Solugen</a>, a startup using synthetic biology to take hydrocarbons out of the chemicals industry, decided against pursuing a new round of funding that would have valued the company at over $1 billion, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Instead, the Houston-based bio-manufacturing company raised an internal round of roughly $30 million from existing investors and continued working on its latest project &#8212; a new bio-based manufacturing process for a high-value specialty chemical that can act as an anti-corrosive agent.</p>
<p>That work represents a potentially lucrative new product line for the company and charts a course for a host of other businesses that are refashioning the basic building blocks of life in an attempt to supplant chemistry with biology for manufacturing and production.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If Solugen can get its high-value chemical into commercial production, the company can follow the path that sustainable tech companies like Tesla have mastered &#8212; moving from a pricy specialty product into the mass market. And rather than over-promise and underdeliver, Solugen wanted to get the product line right first before raising big bucks, according to people familiar with the company&#8217;s thinking.</p>
<p>As the world looks to move away from oil and its byproducts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down or reverse global climate change, the chemicals industry is in the crosshairs as a huge target for disruption. Vehicle electrification solves only one part of the oil problem. The extractive industry doesn&#8217;t just produce fuel, but also the chemicals that make up most of the products that defined consumer goods in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Chemicals are everywhere and they&#8217;re a huge business.</p>
<p>Companies like Zymergen raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/zymergen-raised-300-million-because-synthetic-biology-is-so-hot-right-now/">hundreds of millions of dollars last year to develop industrial applications for synthetic biology</a>, and they&#8217;re not alone. Startups including <a href="https://geltor.com/">Geltor</a>, <a href="https://www.impossiblefoods.com/">Impossible Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/">Ginkgo Bioworks</a>, <a href="https://www.lygos.com">Lygos</a>, <a href="https://www.novomer.com/">Novomer</a> and <a href="https://perfectdayfoods.com/">Perfect Day</a> have all raised significant amounts of capital to reduce the environmental footprint of food, chemicals, ingredients and plastics through synthetic biology.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Synthetic biology startups are giving investors an appetite&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/synthetic-biology-startups-ride-a-wave-of-investor-interest/embed/#?secret=TIUcR8AexN" data-secret="TIUcR8AexN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some of these companies are seeing early success in food replacements and ingredients, but the promise of biologically based chemicals have been elusive &#8212; until now.</p>
<p>Solugen&#8217;s new product will produce glucaric acid, a tough-to-make chemical that can be used in water treatment facilities and as an anti-corrosive agent &#8212; and the company can make it with a zero carbon (or potentially carbon negative) manufacturing process, according to Solugen co-founder and chief technology officer, Sean Hunt.</p>
<p>The glucaric acid from Solugen is cheaper to produce and more environmentally friendly than existing phosphonates that are used for water treatment &#8212; and the company has the benefit of competing against chemicals manufacturers in China.</p>
<p>Given the continuing tensions between the two countries, the U.S. is looking to make more high-value products &#8212; including chemicals &#8212; domestically, and Solugen&#8217;s technology is a good way forward to have home-grown supplies of critical materials.</p>
<p>Solugen still intends to raise more capital, the company just wanted to wait until its latest production plant for the acid came online, according to Hunt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the fruit of years of planning. The two co-founders, Hunt and Gaurab Chakrabarti, first realized they could potentially use the technology they&#8217;d developed to make specialty chemicals back in 2017, according to Hunt. But first the company had to make the hydrogen peroxide as a precursor chemical, Hunt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s advantageous for us to focus on this,&#8221; said Hunt. &#8220;As we scale, we can enter more commodity-type markets down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of the notable strides the entire industry is making, said Hunt. &#8220;Synthetic biology has really made significant strides,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have our commercial plant coming online this summer [and it proves] synthetic biology has gotten to the point where we can compete on price and performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the capital infusion will come as the company gets closer to the completion of these commercial scale facilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we were sitting on a term sheet and we said no,&#8221; Hunt said. &#8220;We want to make sure that we are hitting the milestones and the goals at a commensurate pace which is this year. I&#8217;m extremely bullish and optimistic of 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solugen&#8217;s co-founder sees the path that his company is on as one that other startups working in the synthetic biology space will pursue to bring profitable products to market at the higher end before competing with more sustainable versions of commodity chemicals.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you start a company that has this level of capital intensity?&#8221; Hunt asked. &#8220;You can start in the fine chemicals space where everything sells for tens to hundreds of dollars per pound. For us, glucaric acid is that specialty chemical and then we will do commodity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has officially appointed Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel acting FCC chairwoman, and she very well may be the first woman to hold the official position if she is nominated for it later this year, as many expect. With her record of standing for equal access, industry accountability and net neutrality, Rosenworcel&#8217;s FCC will be very different from her predecessor&#8217;s.</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: This article previously stated that Rosenworcel would be the first acting FCC chairwoman, but the formidable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/fcc-commissioner-mignon-clyburn-talks-privacy-compromise-and-connecting-communities/">Mignon Clyburn</a> briefly held the acting role in 2013 while Tom Wheeler was being confirmed. If nominated and confirmed, Rosenworcel would be the first chairwoman.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be designated as the acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden.  I thank the president for the opportunity to lead an agency with such a vital mission and talented staff. It is a privilege to serve the American people and work on their behalf to expand the reach of communications opportunity in the digital age,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Rosenworcel&#8217;s agenda will be made clear over the coming weeks and months, it is likely we will see the return of net neutrality from the shallow grave dug for it by Ajit Pai, and probably a new effort to better understand where in the country actually needs help getting broadband to those who need it, and how to do so quickly and equitably. Her first items of business, however, will likely pertain to getting internet access to those most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p><em> (Disclosure: The FCC regulates TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Verizon, but this has no effect on our coverage.)</em></p>
<p>Rosenworcel first started at the FCC in 2003 and filled other federal communications regulation roles over the years. She was nominated for commissioner by President Obama in 2011 (confirmed in 2012), and was in the running for chair in 2013, though Tom Wheeler ended up taking the spot. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/fcc-fills-vacant-seats-as-jessica-rosenworcel-and-brendan-carr-are-confirmed-by-senate/">Her second term as commissioner began in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout her tenure at the FCC Rosenworcel has pushed for net neutrality and improved broadband access for schools and economically disadvantaged areas. During Ajit Pai&#8217;s tumultuous term as chairman she offered implacable resistance to what she saw as an overly hands-off approach to regulating telecoms, and a fierce indictment of the FCC&#8217;s failure to act in the best interest of the people it serves. Here are a few examples.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>At the 2017 vote killing net neutrality, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/the-fcc-officially-votes-to-kill-net-neutrality/">Rosenworcel was unsparing in voicing her fury</a> at the shadiness of the entire rule-making process:</p>
<blockquote><p>I dissent from this rash decision to roll back net neutrality rules. I dissent from the corrupt process that has brought us to this point. And I dissent from the contempt this agency has shown our citizens in pursuing this path today. This decision puts the Federal Communications Commission on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of the American public.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2018, with an epidemic of robocalling growing by the month, she contradicted Pai&#8217;s claim that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/fcc-slaps-robocaller-with-record-120m-fine-but-its-like-emptying-the-ocean-with-a-teaspoon/">$120 million fine</a> (almost certainly never collected) for one offender proved there was a &#8220;cop on the beat&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today the FCC adopts a forfeiture order to impose a penalty on one operation that made tens of millions of robocalls two years ago.  I support it. But let’s be honest: Going after a single bad actor is emptying the ocean with a teaspoon — and right now we’re all wet.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the industry <em>still</em> has not widely adopted the framework that would nip robocalls in the bud is testament to this, though they should soon after the FCC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fcc-mandates-strict-caller-id-authentication-to-beat-back-robocalls/">finally got in gear</a>. (This year she also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/10/its-time-to-chart-a-course-for-5g-success/">contributed a piece to TechCrunch to call for immediate action on the rollout of 5G</a>.)</p>

<p>In 2019, Rosenworcel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/a-year-after-outcry-carriers-are-finally-stopping-sale-of-location-data-letters-to-fcc-show/">called out the agency&#8217;s seeming lack of concern</a> about a major loophole in telecoms regulation that allowed every mobile service vendor to essentially sell real-time location data to anyone willing to pay for it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FCC has been totally silent about press reports that for a few hundred dollars shady middlemen can sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data. That’s unacceptable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her office released letters to the agency from the major carriers as a stopgap measure to inform people. When the FCC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/carriers-violated-federal-law-by-selling-your-location-data-fcc-tells-congress/">finally formally moved against the practice</a>, she noted, &#8220;It’s a shame that it took so long for the FCC to reach a conclusion that was so obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, Rosenworcel raised for the nth time the FCC&#8217;s lack of good data concerning broadband deployment in the country. The problem had rankled for years but was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/fcc-dings-company-for-164k-after-its-false-broadband-claims-distorted-national-report/">highlighted by a spectacular failure to vet industry data</a> provided more or less on the honor system, which ended up throwing off numbers nationally:</p>
<blockquote><p>This should have set off alarm bells at the FCC. In fact, agency staff reached out to the company nearly a dozen times over multiple years, including after this suspect data was filed. Despite these efforts behind the scenes, on February 19, 2019, the FCC used the erroneous data filed by BarrierFree in a press release, claiming great progress in closing the nation’s digital divide. When an outside party pointed out this was based on fraudulent information, the FCC was forced to revise its claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>An embarrassing demonstration of how poor the current system is. Of the broadband report itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/fccs-broadband-deployment-report-called-fundamentally-at-odds-with-reality/">she had written earlier</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This report deserves a failing grade. Putting aside the embarrassing fumble of the FCC blindly accepting incorrect data for the original version of this report, there are serious problems with its basic methodology. Time and again this agency has acknowledged the grave limitations of the data we collect to assess broadband deployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, if the FCC doesn&#8217;t know who actually is getting decent broadband and who isn&#8217;t, how can they direct funds to help bridge that gap?</p>
<p>Lastly, late in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/with-absurd-timing-fcc-announces-intention-to-revisit-section-230/">when Pai caved to administration pressure</a> to reevaluate the hugely important Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for the content posted on them, Rosenworcel once again summed up the situation simply and honestly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The timing of this effort is absurd. The FCC has no business being the president’s speech police.</p></blockquote>
<p>This abortive attempt to weaken Section 230 never had legs to begin with and will not be pursued further, according to an FCC source.</p>
<p>These are only a handful of the more high-profile moments of Rosenworcel&#8217;s latest term, and in fact it is something of a disservice to list just them. The work of an FCC commissioner, their staff and the bureaus they rely on, is largely obscure and technical, with moments like those listed above more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/senate-confirms-nathan-simington-as-fcc-commissioner-potentially-setting-up-years-of-stonewalling/">last-minute confirmation of Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington</a>, the FCC is currently at a 2-2 in its normally 3-2 partisan makeup in favor of the presiding administration. Since Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia, the feared deadlock will likely be avoided, with a fifth commissioner nominated and confirmed in short order so that work can begin. We&#8217;ll know more about Rosenworcel&#8217;s priorities and agenda soon.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Regulators may still want to imply Bitcoin is merely a tool for criminals, but for many middle-class users, it’s proving to be a lifeline.</p>
<p>Even as politicians like European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde criticize cryptocurrency for providing &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1349341678335893504"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loopholes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; used for “funny business,” people like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saeed, an Iranian immigrant to France, see cryptocurrency as a necessity, because of the difficulty using mainstream financial systems.</span></p>
<p>Until 2020, Saeed, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was a software engineer in Iran whose salary barely reached €300 due to <a href="https://www.iranfocus.com/en/economy/46057-irans-poor-economic-outlook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rampant inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, he started freelancing for international clients that paid him in Bitcoin. By September 2020, he’d finally saved enough Bitcoin to go to graduate school in France. However, the pandemic made his immigration process much harder.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I passed all that strange bureaucracy and to get to a course in France last September, with only €1,000 in my pocket,” Saeed said. “HSBC, Banque Nationale de Paris, La Banque Postale, all rejected me, declining to open a bank account. I finally found a bank after a month.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Saeed used Bitcoin. He is exactly the type of person who benefits from “loopholes” in the traditional banking system.</p>
<p>“Many people in Iran are working with European tech companies,” Saeed said. “Maybe I can’t buy Bitcoin directly from the exchange because of my nationality.”</p>
<p>Saeed thinks Lagarde represents bankers’ and government interests, not average citizens, who are happy to work with him. He said stricter regulations would make his access to the financial system more time-consuming and expensive, because he’d have to pay friends and colleagues to transact on his behalf. However, Iranian migrants are hardly the sole user group relying on Bitcoin during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, a British expat named Paul found himself trapped in London when flights back to his Asian country of residence got canceled. Due to tight capital controls in his former country, and the challenges of repatriation during constant lockdowns, Paul was living in between regulatory systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I closed down the business [in Asia] just before the pandemic started. My father passed away and it was difficult to continue my company,&#8221; Paul said. &#8220;I was in hotels and Airbnbs for weeks and didn’t have a residential address&#8230;without Bitcoin I would have been locked out of cash. I could only take money out of the ATM for a certain number of months because it’s limited to holidays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily, Paul had a little Bitcoin from earlier that year. Unlike Saeed, he didn’t feel comfortable with the technical aspects, but he learned quickly. He used Bitcoin to buy gift cards for groceries, phone bills, hotels and Uber, plus paid a friend back in Asia to help wrap up his apartment and put things in storage.</p>
<p>“I think it was generally a bad idea but, at least with Brexit, thank god we won’t be subject to whatever Lagarde does,” Paul said, adding that regulation can be beneficial if it avoids restrictions for people who don’t have banking access.</p>
<p>Today, almost a year later, Paul still doesn’t have access to most of his financial accounts. Instead, he downloaded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">Monzo</a>, a banking app that uses passports for identity verification instead of residential addresses. He pays friends in London to deposit to his Monzo account.</p>
<p>“It becomes really convoluted. I primarily use crypto because it’s easier,” Paul said. “One of my friends is a student from Nigeria and had a similar experience. He used Bitcoin to pay his school fees… I’ve been at my current residence for a couple of months, so I would be able to finally open a bank account. But now I don’t really see the need, especially with the news of negative interest rates.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fiat-denominated price of Bitcoin<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past six months. This provided Saeed and Paul both with a little extra capital to spend time figuring out what they want to do next. For Saeed, does it make sense to do the graduate program online, with fewer networking benefits and hands-on experiences (the reason he came to France)? How does Paul move forward with his career now that his family business closed and his sector (music marketing) is in shambles? </span></p>

<p>Buying Bitcoin could be considered a form of gambling. Indeed, many <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/normies-crypto-rich-defi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">middle-class hobbyist traders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accrued life-changing amounts of wealth over the past year, usually by experimenting with risky software. For people like Paul and Saeed, who generally avoid experimental trades and lack alternative investment options, Bitcoin’s price appreciation is helping them get through a period of abysmal job markets and intermittent lockdowns. People don’t need to live in a dictatorship or a country suffering from high inflation to benefit from Bitcoin. I would know; I’m one of them. </span></p>
<p>Like many people during the pandemic, my living situation changed dramatically and I initially couldn’t work full-time from home. I was lucky to sell a few poems in exchange for cryptocurrency, usually via direct messages and Bitcoin wallets or as <a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:2855:0x2b555c64f7bdf8d26a0d4065ce872e6ce1830257?tab=owners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital collectibles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through </span><a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:1133:0x8124b02b4967bd7338a450420a572d574915ff9c?tab=owners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:7408:0xbdceed3d7ec60ecf9fb50215e767ca51daa96f01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech-savvy artists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then the bull market surged again, sending those meager earnings high enough to cover some of my bills. A valet worker and student in Kansas named Hess had a similar experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarantine helped kill his relationship of six years and he found himself needing to move out. He put his savings into Bitcoin during spring 2020, so that by December he was able to move out.</span></span></p>
<p>“COVID hit and I was out of steady work for four months,” Hess said. “Honestly, if it wasn&#8217;t for my decision to basically throw 70% of my net worth into Bitcoin, I don&#8217;t think I would be in as good of a place mentally and financially.”</p>
<p>To be clear, that is an extremely risky financial move and I would not advise it as a first resort. Yet, for many people experiencing unexpected change due to COVID-19, Bitcoin has become the lifeline it was for Hess.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Bitcoin donations may have gained popularity with several American communities, including some of the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/bitcoin-and-alt-right"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremist groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved with storming Capitol Hill. Incoming </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/janet-yellen-says-cryptocurrencies-are-a-concern-in-terrorist-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> echoed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lagarde’s concerns about Bitcoin being used for criminal activities.</span></p>
<p>However, so far, the analytics company <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/extremist-crypto-donations-chainalysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such donations add up to roughly </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/capitol-riot-bitcoin-donation-alt-right-domestic-extremism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$522,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These numbers might also be compared to the cumulative totals managed by other subjects referenced in this article. For yet another lawful example, Lawrence Douglas, a former operations director at an event security company in California, lost his job as a result of the pandemic.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Biden administration can change the world with new crypto regulations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/the-biden-administration-can-change-the-world-with-new-crypto-regulations/embed/#?secret=yZa0akVjAX" data-secret="yZa0akVjAX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Cash App pretty much changed my financial life,” Douglas said. “Bitcoin prices during the calendar year of 2020 provided me with lots of wiggle room, while I currently search for a new job.”</p>
<p>As an unemployed Black man, he was <a href="https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/investing/investing-and-systemic-racism">statistically less likely to have connections who could help him learn about stocks or precious metals</a>, for example. He said Bitcoin, comparatively, has a “low barrier to entry.” In April 2020, he turned his stimulus check into a little Bitcoin nest egg. By November, he was utilizing a strategy called dollar-cost averaging, routinely buying small amounts of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Douglas, like Paul, first bought cryptocurrency during the pandemic. On the other hand, when I interviewed more than a dozen Bitcoin users across Europe and North America for this article, most of them were crypto veterans who said Bitcoin gave them “peace” during the year-long crisis. Anesthesiologist Quentin Lobb, for example, said “bottom line, our net worth grew tremendously in 2020, thanks to Bitcoin. It has provided a pleasant and exciting sense of financial security.”</p>
<p>Yet another crypto veteran, Texas real estate agent broker Brandon Arnold, said the national political and economic situation was more “mentally taxing than ever before.” Against that backdrop, controlling a fraction of his own wealth gives him a sense of security. The price appreciation helps too, to be sure, though it’s not why Bitcoin is now so popular with middle-class users.</p>
<p>“If I factor in the risk of not having access to my capital, the price volatility doesn’t really matter,” Paul said. “As long as the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, it’s still more useful for me than the other options available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://omnipresent.com">Omnipresent</a>, which helps companies employ remote-working local teams worldwide, has closed a $15.8 million Series A funding round. The fundraise was led by an undisclosed investor with participation from existing investors, Episode 1, Playfair Capital and Truesight Ventures. The company said it closed the round five months after its July 2020 $2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Founders Matthew Wilson and Guenther Eisinger started the company as part of Entrepreneur First’s London cohort in 2019.</p>
<p>Omnipresent says it ensures the process of remote-hiring costs a fraction of what it would if the company did it on their own, by using Omnipresent&#8217;s platform to onboard employees compliantly in 150 countries. It provides employees with local contracts, tax contributions, and local and international benefits such as health insurance, pensions and equity options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a joint statement, Guenther Eisinger and Matthew Wilson, co-CEOs of Omnipresent said: “Even before the pandemic we recognized the revolutionary potential of breaking down legal and administrative barriers of international employment. As former business owners, we had firsthand experience of what a headache it is to navigate the complexity and bureaucracy of building global teams. Now with the pandemic and the global shift toward remote working it’s confirmed that we are on the right track.”</p>
<p>Wilson told me in an interview: “For instance, in Canada, we have a Canadian entity and we enter into an employment relationship with that person in Canada, on behalf of our client, so they don&#8217;t have to set up any of the legal infrastructure themselves in Canada, or any of the 149 countries that we operate in. We then manage all the ongoing administration of the employment relationship, whether that&#8217;s from an HR perspective, from an employee benefits perspective, or if they want to get health care for instance.”</p>
<p>The company competes with other firms like Remote.com and Boundless HQ.</p>
<p>Carina Namih, general partner at Episode 1 Ventures commented: “While talent is evenly distributed around the world, for too long, opportunities have not been. I have experienced firsthand the challenge of hiring globally. Omnipresent has already become a crucial piece of infrastructure for global teams working across different countries.”</p>
<p>Joe Thornton, general partner at Playfair Capital commented: “Remote work undoubtedly represents the future of the modern workforce. The sooner companies adapt, the sooner they will reap the massive competitive advantage associated with a globally distributed workforce, including increased workforce productivity and satisfaction and a larger and more diverse pool of talent from which to recruit workers.”</p>
<p>Omnipresent said its own employer surveys show that over 85% of employers will be employing remote or international employees in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart plans to lay off nearly 2,000 of its workers, including the 10 workers from the Kroger-owned Mariano&#8217;s who unionized early last year, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">Vice reports</a>. These workers are responsible for in-store shopping and packing of groceries.</p>
<p>According to Vice, 10 of the workers affected unionized with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 in Skokie, Illinois. However, they have yet to negotiate a contract with Instacart, according to Vice. Instacart notified the union of the planned changes earlier this week.<a href="https://www.ufcw.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/61/files/2021/01/Jan-2021-Instacart-Fires-Nearly-2000-Grocery-Workers.pdf"> In the letter</a>, Instacart said it planned to stop using in-store shoppers at Kroger-owned stores, which includes the Mariano&#8217;s store in Skokie, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but no earlier than mid-March.</p>
<p>Currently, Instacart says it&#8217;s working to place the impacted employees with jobs at retailers or place them at other grocery stores that still rely on Instacart shoppers. In total, Instacart said about 1,800 employees will be affected by these changes. Those laid off will receive separation packages, according to Instacart. But according to UFCW, Instacart will provide between $250 to $750 to the workers they let go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instacart <a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/introducing-new-instacart-pickup-retailer-models-d9d5ef56d46f">referenced the potential layoffs in a blog post</a> earlier this week in a post about new pickup retailer model. In it, Instacart said it would wind down some of its in-store operations at some retail locations to switch to what it&#8217;s calling Partner Pick. Through Partner Pick, instead of relying on Instacart shoppers to pick and pack groceries, retailers will rely on their own workforces with the help of Instacart&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of some grocers transitioning to a Partner Pick model, we’ll be winding down our in-store operations at select retailer locations over the coming months,&#8221; an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;We know this is an incredibly challenging time for many as we move through the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition. This includes transferring impacted shoppers to other retailer locations where we have Instacart in-store shopper roles open, working closely with our retail partners to hire impacted shoppers for roles they’re looking to fill and providing shoppers with transition assistance as they explore new work opportunities. We’re also providing all impacted shoppers with separation packages based on their tenure with Instacart.&#8221;</p>
<p>This all comes as Instacart is gearing up to go public. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instacart-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-instacart-taps-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-at-30-billion-valuation-sources-idUSKBN27S3AG">In November</a>, Reuters reported Instacart picked Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO at a $30 billion valuation. That would be a big jump from the $17.7 post-money valuation Instacart secured in October with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">new $200 million funding round</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-instacart-firing-grocery-workers-is-ruthless-attempt-to-eliminate-jobs-of-essential-workers-on-frontlines-of-covid-19-protecting-food-access-in-pandemic/">In a statement</a>, UFCW International president Marc Perrone called these workers a lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic and called on Instacart to stop these plans to fire them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instacart firing the only unionized workers at the company and destroying the jobs of nearly 2,000 dedicated frontline workers in the middle of this public health crisis, is simply wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As the union for Instacart grocery workers in the Chicago area and grocery workers nationwide, UFCW is calling on Instacart to immediately halt these plans and to put the health of their customers first by protecting the jobs of these brave essential workers at a time when our communities need them most.&#8221;</p>

<p>DuVernay has directed theatrically released films including &#8220;Selma&#8221; and &#8220;A Wrinkle in Time,&#8221; but she also made &#8220;13th&#8221; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/when-they-see-us-viewership/">&#8220;When They See Us&#8221;</a> for Netflix, and she&#8217;s been an eloquent proponent for streaming as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/movies/ava-duvernay-movies.html">a more accessible way of telling her stories</a>.</p>
<p>Spotify says that through this multiyear partnership, Array will be creating exclusive scripted and unscripted programming for the streaming audio platform. For these productions, it will be working with Gimlet, the podcast network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts/">Spotify acquired in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Recognizing the undeniable power of voice and sound, I’m thrilled to extend ARRAY’s storytelling into the realm of podcasts,” DuVernay said in a statement. “The opportunity to work with [Gimlet&#8217;s head of content] Lydia Polgreen and her passionate team drew us to Spotify as a home for our audio narratives and we couldn’t be more excited to begin this new creative journey.”</p>
<p>In addition to acquiring Gimlet, Spotify has also signed exclusive podcast deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/barack-michelle-obama-spotify/">Barack and Michelle Obama</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Joe Rogan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/spotify-inks-multi-year-podcasting-deal-with-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle/">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced Thursday that its newly established external policy review group will take on one of the company&#8217;s most consequential acts: The decision to suspend former President Trump.</p>
<p>On January 7, Facebook suspended Trump&#8217;s account indefinitely. That decision followed the president&#8217;s actions the day prior, when he incited a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, leaving American democracy on a razor&#8217;s edge and a nation already deep in crisis even more shaken.</p>
<p>Facebook VP of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg called the circumstances around Trump&#8217;s suspension an &#8220;unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action&#8221; and explained why the Oversight Board would review the case.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our decision to suspend then-President Trump’s access was taken in extraordinary circumstances: A U.S. president actively fomenting a violent insurrection designed to thwart the peaceful transition of power; five people killed; legislators fleeing the seat of democracy,&#8221; <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/referring-trump-suspension-to-oversight-board/">Clegg said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has never happened before — and we hope it will never happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/embed/#?secret=tYid2KFmxF" data-secret="tYid2KFmxF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In its own <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/236821561313092-oversight-board-accepts-case-on-former-us-president-trump-s-indefinite-suspension-from-facebook-and-instagram/">statement on taking the case</a>, the Oversight Board explained that a five-member panel will evaluate the case soon with a decision planned within 90 days. Once that smaller group reaches its conclusions on how to handle Trump&#8217;s Facebook status — and, potentially, future cases involving world leaders — the decision will require approval from the majority of the board&#8217;s members. After that, the pace picks up a bit and Facebook will have one week to implement the board&#8217;s final decision.</p>
<p>Facebook likes to say that the board is independent, but in spite of having the autonomy to make &#8220;binding&#8221; case-by-case decisions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/under-consideration/">the board grew out of Facebook itself</a>. The company appointed the board&#8217;s four original co-chairs and those members went on to expand the group into a 20-member body.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve previously reported, the mechanics of the board bias its activity toward Facebook content taken down — not the stuff that stays up, which generally creates larger headaches for the company and society at large. Facebook has responded to this critique, noting that while the board may initially focus on reviewing takedowns, content still up on the platforms will be part of the project&#8217;s scope &#8220;as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given some of the criticism around the group, the Trump case is a big moment for how impactful the board&#8217;s decisions will really wind up being. If it were to overturn Facebook&#8217;s decision, that decision would likely kick up a new firestorm of interest around Trump&#8217;s Facebook account, even as the former president recedes from the public eye.</p>
<p>The most interesting bit about the process is that it will allow the former president&#8217;s account admins to appeal his own case. If they do so, the board will review a &#8220;user statement&#8221; arguing why Trump&#8217;s account should be reinstated.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s external decision-making body is meant as a kind of &#8220;supreme court&#8221; for the company&#8217;s own policy making. It doesn&#8217;t really move quickly or respond in the moment, but instead seeks to establish precedents that can lend insight to future policy cases. While the per-case decisions are binding, whether the broader precedents it creates will impact Facebook&#8217;s future policy decisions remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re somewhat famous on various social networks, chances are you are exposed to hate speech in your replies or in your comments. French startup <a href="https://www.bodyguard.ai">Bodyguard</a> recently launched its app and service in English so that it can hide toxic content from your eyes. It has been available in French for a few years and the company has attracted 50,000 users so far.</p>
<p>“We have developed a technology that detects hate speech on the internet with a 90% to 95% accuracy and only 2% of false positive,” founder and CEO Charles Cohen told me.</p>
<p>The company has started with a mobile app that anyone can use. After you download the app and connect the app with your favorite social networks, you choose the level of moderation. There are several categories, such as insults, body shaming, moral harassment, sexual harassment, racism and homophobia. You can select whether it’s a low priority or a top priority for each category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you don’t have to open the app again. Bodyguard scans replies and comments from its servers and makes a decision whether something is OK. For instance, it can hide comments, mute users, block users, etc. When you open Instagram or Twitter again, it&#8217;s like those hateful comments never existed.</p>
<p>The app currently supports Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Twitch. Unfortunately, it can’t process content on Snapchat and TikTok due to API limitations.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, most moderation services rely heavily on machine learning or keyword-based moderation. Bodyguard has chosen a different approach. It algorithmically cleans up a comment and tries to analyze the content of a comment contextually. It can determine whether a comment is offensive to you, to a third-party person, to a group of persons, etc.</p>
<p>More recently, the startup has launched a B2B product. Other companies can use a Bodyguard-powered API to moderate comments in real-time on their social platforms or in their own apps. The company charges its customers using a traditional software-as-a-service approach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2020 fades into the rearview mirror of history (huzzah!), it’s time to map out strategies to transform your early-stage startup dream into reality. If there’s one thing every early founder needs it’s information, and you’ll find it in abundance at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TechCrunch Early Stage 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Introduced last year — and one of the most popular events in TechCrunch history — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a> provides new startup founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to top experts to help them develop and strengthen their core entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>We’re talking everything from legal issues, fundraising, marketing, growth, product-market fit, tech stack, recruiting, pitch deck teardowns and more. Think of it as a condensed accelerator experience packed with workshops and highly interactive Q&amp;As.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This conference was so popular that we’re hosting <strong>two</strong> virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a> events this year. <strong>Early Stage part one (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April 1-2</a>)</strong> and <strong>Early Stage part two (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8-9</a>)</strong>. Even better, each event stands on its own merit with different topics, content, speakers and perspectives. Attend both to double your knowledge, double your networking, double your opportunities.</p>
<p>We might be biased, but we’re not the only people raving about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TC Early Stage</a>. Listen to what these early-stage founders said about TC Early Stage 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I recommend going to Early Stage. The virtual aspect helps in terms of scheduling, it offers community-building through networking and it gives early-stage founders a framework for navigating the startup ecosystem. This is the stage where founders need more support, especially if they haven’t done this before.” — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.” — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<p>“Early Stage 2020 provided a rich, bootcamp experience with premier founders, VCs and startup community experts. If you’re beginning to build a startup, it’s an efficient way to advance your knowledge across key startup topics.” — Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s the skinny on passes. Founder passes for either April or July event cost $199. Investors and startup enthusiasts can purchase Innovator passes for $299. <strong>Note:</strong> Early-bird pricing ends Feb 27 and May 1, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save more when you buy a dual-event pass. Attend both Early Stage events for just $299 (Founder) or $349 (Innovator). Remember: The events feature different speakers, topics and content.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this unparalleled, interactive opportunity to learn best startup practices from leading experts, investors and successful founders. Mark your calendar and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">buy your Early Stage passes</a> today!</p>
