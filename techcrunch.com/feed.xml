		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikki-dominguez/">Nikki Dominguez</a> is the co-founder and president of <a href="https://handsomeapp.com/">Handsome</a>, an app that provides beauty professionals with equal career opportunities. She also built two beauty academies and one school and turned a team of 70 into a team of more than 150 stylists.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic struck last year, the fundraising world turned upside down. Due to shifting priorities, investors had to commit to taking care of their portfolio companies, the majority of which were led by white men.</p>
<p>Any funding opportunities we had in the pipeline evaporated. This was especially true for investors considering attempts to reach new and underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>But the fundraising market came back pretty quickly in 2020 &#8212; for some. And though we are thrilled to have closed a $1.5 million pre-seed round in the middle of a pandemic, the challenges we faced in the past continued. The spotlight only turned back on minority founders after the Black Lives Matter movement took off last summer, and we began to pursue fundraising again in late 2020. We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.</p>
<p>We were in our second year of running <a href="https://handsomeapp.com/">Handsome</a> and had traction similar to, if not better than, other male-centric startups that were getting funded, yet we still ran into friction when fundraising. The hard part was that we didn’t have any concrete evidence as to why, or the extent to which, fundraising was harder for minority and female teams outside of our apparent challenges and personal experiences. Men are allowed to have a vision or an idea on the back of a cocktail napkin, while women need to have fully established businesses and revenue streams.</p>
<h2>The evidence is in the analytics</h2>
<p>DocSend, a tool that we and thousands of other startups use to send out pitch decks to investors, analyzed how investors interact with pitch decks. A recent DocSend <a href="https://try.docsend.com/funding-divide-report">study</a> confirmed our hunch, finding that investors do indeed scrutinize the decks of businesses founded by women and minorities differently.</p>
<p>For instance, their data showed investors spent 20% longer on the business model section of decks from all-female teams at the pre-seed stage than all-male teams. While more time spent on a particular section of a deck may seem to indicate more interest, it can actually be a sign of greater scrutiny and skepticism.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When you look at the makeup of the average VC you are pitching to, it is likely a middle-aged white man. When pitching Handsome — something that’s reimagining the education and community of the beauty industry — you can imagine that most VCs don’t understand the value and opportunity at hand. Although beauty is a $190 billion global industry ($60 billion alone in the U.S.), investors who don’t follow this industry might have a hard time understanding how big it is, how the industry works, and how our business fits into this thriving market. Even further, investors might completely discredit our business because of the “beauty” label.</p>
<p>All these factors can lead to more time spent analyzing the business model &#8212; and its viability &#8212; articulated in our pitch deck. In reality, VCs are busy, and if they’re spending more time on the fundamentals of your business, they don’t understand it. It’s more likely they are looking for ways that your business won’t work. And, frankly, we are not business school graduates or Stanford alumni, so investors who want to de-risk their portfolios will spend more time looking at our deck to gauge if we know how to build a business.</p>
<h2>More than goodwill is needed for lasting change</h2>
<p>Despite all this, we believe that most of the time, investors don’t even know they are acting on these biases. They don’t realize they may have already written you off, which is part of the problem. Awareness of a subconscious bias is the first step toward making positive change. Investors may think they’re widening the funnel simply by taking a meeting or providing mentorship over coffee when, subconsciously, they’ve already counted you out.</p>
<p>Even though the barriers are being lowered, minority founders just starting out still have a hard time getting their foot in the door. Most underrepresented founders don’t have an established network, making it difficult to get even an initial introduction. That’s why these founders aren’t getting meetings. So even with more investor goodwill, founders are still unable to access the capital they need to grow their businesses.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to enact meaningful changes. Truly committed people are going to work on these issues over the coming years and decades. It’s only on a longer time scale that we’re going to be able to tell whether investors promising change have delivered. Changing the demographics of the founders you fund requires year in, year out consistency, again and again and again.</p>
<p>Only then will we see a time when the future of great ideas is not hindered by the demographics of the people building businesses out of those ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A code repository used by the New York state government&#8217;s IT department was left exposed on the internet, allowing anyone to access the projects inside, some of which contained secret keys and passwords associated with state government systems.</p>
<p>The exposed GitLab server was discovered on Saturday by Dubai-based SpiderSilk, a cybersecurity company credited with discovering data spills at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/samsung-source-code-leak/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/">Clearview AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/moviepass-thousands-data-exposed-leak/">MoviePass</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations use GitLab to collaboratively develop and store their source code — as well as the secret keys, tokens and passwords needed for the projects to work — on servers that they control. But the exposed server was accessible from the internet and configured so that anyone from outside the organization could create a user account and log in unimpeded, SpiderSilk&#8217;s chief security officer Mossab Hussin told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch visited the GitLab server, the login page showed it was accepting new user accounts. It&#8217;s not known exactly how long the GitLab server was accessible in this way, but <a href="https://www.shodan.io/host/161.11.141.160">historic records</a> from Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, shows the GitLab was first detected on the internet on March 18.</p>
<p>SpiderSilk shared several screenshots showing that the GitLab server contained secret keys and passwords associated with servers and databases belonging to New York State&#8217;s Office of Information Technology Services. Fearing the exposed server could be maliciously accessed or tampered with, the startup asked for help in disclosing the security lapse to the state.</p>
<p>TechCrunch alerted the New York governor&#8217;s office to the exposure a short time after the server was found. Several emails to the governor&#8217;s office with details of the exposed GitLab server were opened but were not responded to. The server went offline on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Scot Reif, a spokesperson for New York State&#8217;s Office of Information Technology Services, said the server was &#8220;a test box set up by a vendor, there is no data whatsoever, and it has already been decommissioned by ITS.&#8221; (Reif declared his response “on background&#8221; and attributable to a state official, which would require both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were not given the opportunity to reject the terms.)</p>
<p>When asked, Reif would not say who the vendor was or if the passwords on the server were changed. Several projects on the server were marked &#8220;prod,&#8221; or common shorthand for &#8220;production,&#8221; a term for servers that are actively use. Reif also would not say if the incident was reported to the state&#8217;s Attorney General&#8217;s office. When reached, a spokesperson for the Attorney General did not comment by press time.</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands the vendor is Indotronix-Avani, a New York-based company with offices in India, and owned by venture capital firm Nigama Ventures. Several screenshots show some of the GitLab projects were modified by a project manager at Indotronix-Avani. The vendor&#8217;s website touts New York State on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624162555/https://www.iic.com/staffing/government/">its website</a>, along with other government customers, including the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Indotronix-Avani spokesperson Mark Edmonds did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap today announced <a href="https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-and-snap-inc-announce-expansive-global-agreement-that-spans-recorded-music-and-augmented-reality-experiences/">a multi-year deal</a> with Universal Music Group, one of the largest music companies in the world. From Queen to Justin Bieber, users can clip songs from the expansive UMG catalog to use in their Snaps and on Spotlight, the app&#8217;s TikTok competitor.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">added its Sounds feature</a> in October, which lets users enhance their Snaps with music that Snap has licensed. Snap says that since then, over 521 million videos have been created using Sounds, which have been viewed over 31 billion times.</p>
<p>Of course, Snapchat&#8217;s investment in music is a direct response to the growth of music on TikTok. Last year, Fleetwood Mac&#8217;s 1977 album &#8220;Rumours&#8221; re-entered the Billboard charts after &#8220;Dreams,&#8221; a song on the record, went viral on TikTok. Dance trends also often go viral on TikTok, which can correlate with a boost in sales for the artist whose song is featured. So, the more music that&#8217;s licensed by apps like TikTok and Snapchat, the more opportunity there is for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922554253/tiktok-sensation-meet-the-idaho-potato-worker-who-sent-fleetwood-mac-sales-soari">another Nathan Apodaca moment</a>, which means free publicity for the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Already, gen Z artists like Olivia Rodrigo have leveraged these social platforms to promote their new music. On Snap, over 10 million videos were created using her song &#8220;Driver&#8217;s License,&#8221; Snap reports. Rodrigo was also the first artist to use AR Lenses on Snapchat to promote her record-breaking debut &#8220;Sour,&#8221; but to be fair, she also shared AR effects on Instagram.</p>
<p>Olivia Rodrigo sings about &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cii6ruuycQA">deja vu</a>&#8221; on her new album, and you might also be getting deja vu from Snap&#8217;s announcement. TikTok also <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/digital-and-mobile/9523263/universal-music-tiktok-partner-artist-collabs-data">struck a deal with UMG</a> in February. And before that, in November, TikTok announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/tiktok-strikes-new-licensing-agreement-with-sony-music/">a new licensing agreement</a> with Sony. Meanwhile, Snap&#8217;s portfolio of music partners include Warner Music Group, Sony Music Publishing, and more.</p>
<p>These deals aren&#8217;t exclusive &#8212; you can make a video with &#8220;deja vu&#8221; on Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram alike. When it comes to deals like these, it&#8217;s a constant battle of reactionary one-upmanship. If TikTok makes a deal with UMG, Snapchat needs to strike a deal with UMG as well to remain competitive, which is what we&#8217;re seeing today. As our friend Olivia would say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM2U8cb8lhI">it&#8217;s brutal out here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BuzzFeed had a hard time with growth in 2020, but its deck showcases big optimism about the future of its leading business (advertising) and growth business (commerce). ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital media outfit BuzzFeed <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d48f9628aa4c7d9c789d29/1624543127007/BuzzFeed+Inc+Press+Release.pdf">announced</a> today that it will go public via a SPAC, or blank check company. BuzzFeed also disclosed that it will purchase Complex, another media company, for $300 million in cash and shares in BuzzFeed itself; the SPAC deal will help finance its purchase of Complex.</p>
<p>The transaction will see BuzzFeed merge with 890 Fifth Avenue Partners Inc., a public company, with the combined entity sporting an enterprise valuation of around $1.5 billion after its completion.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed&#8217;s SPAC partner is bringing $288 million in cash to the table, and BuzzFeed intends to raise another $150 million in a convertible debt offering.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

	</p>
<p>In raw numbers, BuzzFeed is a large company with hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly revenue and a roughly break-even business in recent years. The company&#8217;s investor presentation anticipates a return to growth after a mostly flat 2020, and rising profitability over time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get into the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d46000058c421e525ff0d2/1624530951725/BuzzFeed+Investor+Presentation.pdf">company&#8217;s investor presentation</a>. We want to know about its historical growth, anticipated growth, revenue mix and profitability, as well as how the company thinks about its news division. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve broken each of our points into its own minisection, so if you want to skate ahead to any particular point, feel free!</p>
<h2>Historical revenue growth</h2>
<p>Why is BuzzFeed buying Complex? In part, because it adds audience scale to its platform, a key to the company&#8217;s expected future advertising revenue growth (more on that in a moment). But also because Complex adds a lot of revenue to its overall top-line picture.</p>
<p>For example, in BuzzFeed&#8217;s historical revenue figures we see the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>2019: $425 million.</li>
<li>2020: $421 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the company&#8217;s historical results are <em>inclusive</em> of Complex. Here&#8217;s the breakdown of the company&#8217;s historical revenues (gray) and Complex&#8217;s own (black). The combined figures are what BuzzFeed notes in its trailing metrics:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169786" style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169786" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2169786 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png" alt="" width="477" height="202" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169786" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BuzzFeed SPAC deck</p></div></p>
<p>From this breakdown, we can see that BuzzFeed anticipates 19% growth from Complex in 2021, and just under 23% growth from the group it&#8217;s acquiring in 2022.</p>
<p>Per a later slide, BuzzFeed grew 4% in 2019, inclusive of historical Complex numbers. That figure fell to -1% in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Our read of the company&#8217;s historical revenue growth is that it weathered a turbulent 2020 in reasonable health; digital advertising took a huge hit in the first half of the year, likely impacting BuzzFeed&#8217;s operating results. To see it manage an essentially flat revenue result last year feels pretty OK.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://smartasset.com/">SmartAsset</a>, a marketplace that connects consumers to financial advisors, announced today that it has raised $110 million in a Series D round of funding.</p>
<p>The financing values New York-based SmartAsset at over $1 billion, and brings its total raised since its 2012 inception to just over $161 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartasset/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>TTV Capital led SmartAsset’s Series D, which also included participation from Javelin Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, New York Life Ventures, North Bridge Venture Partners and CMFG Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company last raised in June of 2018 &#8211; a $28 million Series C led by Focus Financial Partners. Since then, it says it has grown revenue “by 10 times” and is now on the cusp of reaching $100 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). It recently made its one millionth consumer/advisor match on its <a href="https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/about">SmartAdvisor</a> platform. Also in 2020, SmartAsset says it referred $10 billion in new, closed assets under management (AUM) to financial advisors and firms across the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dbQUT9xav2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/smartasset-series-c/">Personal finance startup SmartAsset raises $28M</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides pairing consumers with advisors with its Automated Financial Modeling software, SmartAsset claims to reach over 100 million people each month through its personal finance content, tools and “personalized” calculators.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, Carvin worked in finance. In <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/qa-with-michael-carvin-cofounder-of-smartasset/">an interview with Y Combinator </a>(one of its backers), he shared how his frustration in finding information about buying a home and getting a mortgage “that was useful, accurate and unbiased” led him to join forces with Philip Camilleri to found SmartAsset.</p>
<p>“Calculators had obvious errors and the content seemed like it was all written by people that wanted me to take out the largest mortgage possible,” he added. So the pair launched SmartAsset in an effort to provide people with the tools and content to help them make better decisions around topics such as retirement, taxes, savings, homeownership and insurance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169963" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169963" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2169963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="602" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SmartAsset CEO and co-founder Michael Carvin / SmartAsset</p></div></p>
<p>The company plans to use the new capital to invest in new product offerings, technology infrastructure and data partnerships. It also plans to boost its current headcount of 202 by more than 75% this year.</p>
<p>TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said the company “is quickly expanding its lead in one of the largest markets in the U.S. by providing an incredibly valuable resource for both consumers and financial advisors alike.”</p>
<p>The funding and its flashy valuation comes with a certain weight, even in the growing world of unicorn companies.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/1f0c796e3117f8188cc9e43a574eb1b1a5b3dd17/52eb41258feffb54f8289e5e4b73f7b9/2a58c7e2f7d9a1ef370be345daee2da9/www.abnewswire.com/pressreleases/black-unicorn-factory-cracks-the-unicorn-startup-code_544450.html">claims that</a>, with today’s news, co-founder Michael Carvin now becomes the third Black founder and CEO of a company valued at over $1 billion. Others include Compass CEO and founder Robert Reffkin, whom we recently profiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-robert-reffkin-went-from-being-a-c-average-student-to-the-founder-of-compass/">here</a>, and Calendly CEO and founder Tope Awotona, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">who we have also profiled</a>.</p>
<p>While exciting, the unfortunate rarity of Black-led unicorns is a symptom of historical underfunding in Black or African-American startup founders. Crunchbase estimates that in 2020, 1% of total venture capital funding, or $1 billion, went to this cohort of founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope seeing more successful Black founders inspires more people of color to start companies so that one day this is not news,&#8221; Carvin told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A number of Black-led venture capital firms have closed investments in the past year, which could change this number, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">Collab Capital’s $50 million investment vehicle</a>, Harlem Capital, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">closed a $134 million seed fund </a>earlier this year; Cleo Capital, which set a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/cleo-capital-is-targeting-20-million-for-fund-ii/'"> $20 million target for Fund II</a>; and MaC VC, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">landed $103 million for its inaugural fund.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/hbcuvc-venture-capital-lab-fund-1-million/">HBCUvc and Google for Startups also announced this month</a> two separate efforts to provide non-dilutive capital to early-stage, underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>With a Series D under its belt, SmartAsset is working on taking out the bias from personal finance &#8211; while it itself is a case study in how overlooked founders, which routinely suffer from this exact phenomenon, continue to lead strong businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the U.S, after you get vaccinated against COVID-19 you are given a small paper card <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html">issued by the CDC</a> that is essentially the only evidence that you&#8217;ve received your shots. It might seem like a flimsy level of proof, one that you could easily lose, but replacing that paper copy with a digital one has become a political lightning rod in America.</p>
<p>In spite of that, many companies are attempting to attack the problem to produce a viable form of digital proof, sometimes called vaccine passports. For all intents and purposes, what many call a vaccine passport is simply proof you&#8217;ve been vaccinated that you can carry on your smartphone, rather than on a card in your wallet.</p>
<p>Some have argued against the digital approach <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/">for privacy reasons</a>. Others have claimed it is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/theres-a-lot-that-can-go-wrong-with-vaccine-passports/">a civil liberties issue</a>, and some have pointed <a href="https://www.the-parallax.com/digital-health-pass-inequity/">to equity issues</a> related to not having equal access to appropriate technology or the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That lack of consensus along with the open ethical questions, has led some states including <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/04/30/florida-lawmakers-pass-vaccine-passport-ban/">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/25/politics/kemp-georgia-vaccine-passports-covid/index.html">Georgia</a> to ban the use of electronic passport records, at least as far as requiring them to conduct state business or to create a centralized vaccination record keeping system. In Iowa, <a href="https://www.weareiowa.com/article/news/local/local-politics/iowa-vaccine-passports-banned-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-bill-into-law/524-898ae00e-605b-4a93-88ee-49d3ec1ddb59">the governor signed a law last month</a> that prohibits businesses and the state from requiring any proof to access services, whether the card is physical or digital.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/which-states-have-banned-vaccine-passports">the patchwork of state laws and executive orders</a> that has resulted in even more complexity for companies trying to develop products to solve this problem. But not every state is banning digital vaccination records. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-18/what-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new-digital-vaccine-verification"> California opened a registration</a> system to request a digital record of your vaccination and New York <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-excelsior-pass-covid-19-vaccine-passport-152722058.html">announced a system earlier this year</a> to download proof of vaccination to your smartphone. More on these approaches later.</p>
<p>We spoke to several experts to get their take on moving your vaccine card to the digital world to find out how this could work in spite of the obvious friction.</p>
<h2>Practical issues</h2>
<p>According to Dr. Shira I. Doron from Tufts Medical Center in Boston, whose specialties include infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology, it&#8217;s not as simple a matter as may sound.</p>
<p>For starters she says, states have not kept records in a consistent way. People have been getting vaccinated in all kinds of places from school gyms to pharmacies to stadiums, and it&#8217;s not clear if those records have made their way to people&#8217;s primary care physicians, assuming they even have one.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Vaccine passports could work] if [a system] had been rolled out that way [with central record keeping in mind] from December 15th [when we started vaccinating], but it was not. So, if somebody takes it on to go backwards and issue that kind of proof to people, maybe a system like that could work &#8212; and of course there are a lot of people that have taken issue with the ethics of that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For her, it comes down to infection rates. As they drop with more people getting vaccinated, it could alleviate the need for any kind of proof at all because we would be safer simply because the infection rate fell below 10%. &#8220;I think that more ideally we get down to such a low infection rate and such high rate of vaccination that there is no longer a concern about people walking into a building,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe is working on a common framework for &#8216;vaccine passports&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/embed/#?secret=S4sXX7mbqq" data-secret="S4sXX7mbqq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Putting it in on the blockchain</h2>
<p>If the infection rate remains higher than desirable, or certain entities like universities want to require it, how do we offer proof of vaccination beyond the paper card? Some people are pointing to the blockchain, but the approach isn&#8217;t without controversy. New York State is using IBM&#8217;s blockchain technology for its proof of vaccination called <a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass">Excelsior Pass</a>, but<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/"> privacy advocates worry</a> that doing so could expose people&#8217;s personal medical information.</p>
<p>The idea with the IBM approach is that you to go to your physician&#8217;s healthcare portal or some other place that has your vaccine records, and which has partnered with IBM. The portal will present you with a QR code which you can take a picture of with your phone and store in your phone&#8217;s digital wallet. The person then presents the QR code at a venue, which uses a companion scanning application to view it to see proof of vaccination (or a recent negative test). Finally the venue would verify the identity of that person with a secondary form of ID like a driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>The question then is why use the blockchain at all in this instance. IBM Global VP of Payer and Emerging Business Networks Eric Piscini, says that there are three main reasons. &#8220;The first is that the immutability of the blockchain is extremely important, and that&#8217;s [a big reason] why we use it. The second piece, which is also very important is the decentralization of that platform so that [all of the vaccine data] is not just in one place. It&#8217;s decentralized and managed by different parties. [&#8230;] The third piece [&#8230;] is the audit trail, and not just for me as a consumer, but as an [entity] that is trying to verify me,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>But are those reasons enough to justify its use? Steve Wilson, an analyst at Constellation Research, who specializes in end user privacy thinks the blockchain is an inappropriate technology to use for digital proof of vaccination. &#8220;Basically, I don&#8217;t see how blockchain adds anything to the digitizing of COVID vaccinations or tests. The purpose of blockchain is to crowd-source agreement on the ordering of some events, and logging that order in a shared record. What problem in vaccination management does that address,&#8221; he asked.</p>
<h2>An open-source approach to the problem</h2>
<p>When California released a digital vaccination record app last week, it went a different route, using an open-source framework called the <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">Smart Health Cards Framework</a>. The framework was developed by an organization called <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">The Commons Project</a> (TCP) along with a broad coalition of health and technology organizations including Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, Epic and others.</p>
<p>JP Pollack, co-founder of The Commons Project, Senior Researcher-in-Residence at Cornell Tech, and Assistant Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, says that since the government has made clear it won&#8217;t be compiling vaccine records in a central database, and because the vaccine administration system itself is so fragmented, it&#8217;s even more challenging to create digital records. His organization is working to create a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re working on at <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">The Commons Project</a> is a steering group called the <a href="https://vci.org/">Vaccination Credential Initiative or VCI</a>. And the purpose of that group is basically to design and advocate for a specification, someday hopefully a standard, that makes it so that all of those disparate issuers of vaccines can issue the same vaccine record in a signed and portable format,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That comes in the form of a Smart Health Card app that TCP has developed. &#8220;The additional layer that we have built is what turns [your vaccine] information into what we&#8217;re calling the <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">Smart Health Card</a>. And basically it&#8217;s all of the information that goes on your CDC card &#8212; so your name, your date of birth, the type of vaccine that you received, the dates of your doses, lot numbers and where you received it. All of those kinds of things get packaged up into this credential, and that credential is then signed by the issuer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Healthvana&#8217;s digital COVID-19 vaccination records are about communication, not passports for the immune&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/healthvanas-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records-are-about-communication-not-passports-for-the-immune/embed/#?secret=5bxbDp8OIY" data-secret="5bxbDp8OIY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to California, the state of Louisiana also went live with the The Commons Project solution this week, and Walmart recently announced that anyone that received their vaccine through them is now able to download a digital version of their vaccine record directly to the <a href="https://www.commonhealth.org/">CommonHealth</a> app (available on Android) or <a href="https://commonpass.org/">CommonPass</a> app (available on iOS or Android). The company also hinted that other companies that have administered the vaccine would be following Walmart&#8217;s lead in the coming weeks and providing access to digital records through the same apps.</p>
<p>The approach doesn&#8217;t necessarily solve all of the criticisms around equitable access to technology, privacy or the ethics of being asked to show proof vaccination, but it does provide a means to deliver the information digitally for those that want it in an open way.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method your state chooses, if it indeed chooses any approach at all,  it will come with its own set of pros and cons. The paper CDC card, as Wilson points out, is similar in many ways to the &#8220;<a href="https://bookstore.gpo.gov/products/international-certificate-vaccination-or-prophylaxis-approved-world-health-organization-0">Yellow Card</a>&#8221; vaccination record that people traveling overseas have been carrying for decades, and that has worked fine.</p>
<p>But it seems that in 2021 when approximately half the world&#8217;s population owns a smartphone, while two-thirds have some sort of mobile phone, smart or otherwise, it makes sense to make this record available in a digital form. For the many startups and large companies trying to solve that problem, they will have to do more than come up with a clever solution. They will also need to figure out how to convince individuals, businesses and governments that it makes sense to even offer this approach, and that may be the biggest hurdle of all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we become more and more aware of the kind of impact we are having on this planet we call our home, just about everything is having its CO2 impact measured. Who knew, until recently, that streaming Netflix might have <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-your-netflix-habit-5189605">a measurable impact on the environment</a>, for instance. But given vast swathes of the internet are populated by websites, as well as streaming services, then they, too, must have some sort of impact.</p>
<p>It transpires that a new service has identified how to gauge that, and now it’s raised venture capital to scale.</p>
<p>Ryte raised €8.5 million ($10 million) in a previously undisclosed round led by Bayern Kapital out of Munich and Octopus Investments out of London earlier this year for its Website User Experience Platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has now launched the &#8216;Ryte Website Carbon KPI’, which claims to be able to help make 5% of all websites carbon neutral by 2023.</p>
<p>Ryte says it worked with data scientists and environmental experts to develop the ability to accurately measure the carbon impact of clients&#8217; websites. According to carbon transition think tank, the Shift Project, the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet, and the systems supporting them account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions. And this trend is rising rapidly as the world digitizes itself, especially post-pandemic.</p>
<p>Ryte has now engaged its data scientist, Katharina Meraner, who has a PhD in climate science and global warming, and input from Climate Partner, to launch this new service.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are currently 189 million active websites,&#8221; Ryte CEO Andy Bruckschloegl said. &#8220;Our goal is to make 5% of all active websites, or 9.5 million websites, climate neutral by the end of 2023 with the help of our platform, strong partners, social media activities, and much more. Time is ticking and making websites carbon neutral is really easy compared to other industries and processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryte says it is also collaborating with a reforestation project in San Jose, Nicaragua, to allow its customers to offset their remaining emissions through the purchase of climate certificates.</p>
<p>Using a proprietary algorithm, Ryte says it measures the code of the entire website, average page size, as well as monthly traffic by channel then produces a calculation of the amount of CO2 it uses up.</p>
<p>Admittedly there are similar services, but these are ad-hoc and not connected to a platform. A simple Google search will bring us sites like <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Websitecarbon</a>, <a href="https://www.ecosistant.eu/en/website-carbon-footprint/">Ecosistant</a>, and academic papers. But as far as I can tell, a startup like this hasn&#8217;t put this kind of service into their platform yet.</p>
<p>“Teaming up with Ryte will help raise awareness on how information technology contributes to climate change – while at the same time providing tools to make a difference. Ryte’s industry-leading carbon calculator enables thousands of website owners to understand their carbon footprint, to offset unavoidable carbon emissions and thus lay a basis for a comprehensive climate action strategy,” commented Tristan A. Foerster, Co-CEO ClimatePartner.</p>

		Chuck Phillips is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.meetwell.app/">MeetWell</a>, an application that enables teams to achieve a better work-life balance while saving companies money by reducing the amount of bad meetings they attend.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bad meetings are the fast food of the knowledge worker; it&#8217;s so deliciously quick and easy to throw a 60-minute default meeting on everyone&#8217;s schedule, but the long-term costs are extremely unhealthy.</p>
<p>Busy meeting organizers drive-thru schedule meetings because they think they don&#8217;t have time to plan. They expect good outcomes to come from little preparation, which doesn&#8217;t happen. The meetings are being held and progress is stilted.</p>
<p>One way to save everyone significant time (and win lots of friends) would be to just get rid of all meetings, but a well-prepared and well-run session can expedite communication and get a team closer to its goals. Unfortunately, most meetings are <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/16-tips-for-running-remarkably-effective-meetings.html">lazily planned and poorly run</a>, imprisoning attendees and halting productivity.</p>
<p>So how can you separate the good meetings from the bad?</p>
<h2>Measure your meeting waistline</h2>
<p>No one measures the impact of their meetings. So the first step is to start keeping meeting metrics so that you can identify the bad meetings on your teams&#8217; calendars.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My company has created <a href="https://www.meetwell.app/">a calendar assistant</a> that automatically measures and stops bad meetings before they occur, but if you can&#8217;t automate the prevention of bad meetings, survey and learn from attendees after the meeting to record and measure them.</p>
<p>Create taxonomies and quantify the types of meetings that are being held — for example: &#8220;information sharing,&#8221; &#8220;brainstorming,&#8221; &#8220;1:1,&#8221; &#8220;decision-making,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>After several months (ideally a year) of collecting metrics, you can grade the quality and look for patterns. You will probably find something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very few employees decline meetings, even when it&#8217;s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having read more SPAC investor decks in the last twelve months than I&#8217;d like to admit to, I thought I was over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/dont-trust-that-spac-deck/">being irked</a> by their bullishness. Call me conservative, but public companies shouldn&#8217;t be full of shit, and companies going public should probably aim for a similar target.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why S-1 filings for traditional IPOs are great. When it comes to numbers, they are honest. The filings don&#8217;t include forecasts for the next year, let alone the next half decade. Sure, companies will make a pitch for their model and methods, but S-1 filings are pretty good from an honesty perspective. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-files-its-s-1-we-dive-into-the-numbers-and-pose-some-questions/">Mostly</a>.</p>
<p>SPAC investor decks are the opposite. I mean, look at <a href="http://www.spacbyccac.com/doc/Project%20Vision%20PIPE%20Presentation%20vPublic.pdf">this chart</a>:</p>

<p>Historical revenue? Who needs it! Look at the growth that could maybe, possibly, theoretically happen! 201% CAGR!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to change the numbers on these, label them &#8220;Alex&#8217;s future blogging output&#8221; and turn them in before my next performance review.</p>

<p>And one more, this time from the <a href="http://www.northerngenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Project-Empire-Investor-Presentation_v20210622.pdf">recent Embark deal</a> that TechCrunch covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">here</a>:</p>

<p>What about historical revenues? Or expectations from 2021, 2022 or 2023? Who knows!</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/dont-trust-that-spac-deck/">what we&#8217;ve learned about the accuracy of SPAC performance predictions</a>, I think we need a Godzilla-sized Salt Bae to make all of this palatable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ecosystems make strange bedfellows. Here’s one of the stranger in recent memory – and one of the most unexpected bits of news from today’s Windows 11 event. Microsoft announced today that it will be making Android apps available on the next major version of its operating system.</p>
<p>Chief Product Officer Panos Panay called the addition, “just one more small surprise,” noting that the mobile apps can be integrated into the Start menu and taskbar. They’ll also tile or “window” as part of the OS’s new application placement UI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169861" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169861" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="552" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg 1767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The apps will be available through the Microsoft Store by way of the Amazon Appstore. The company highlighted TikTok running on a demo of the operating system. The app is presented in a vertical, portrait orientation, as you would expect from a mobile-first design.</p>
<p>With 1.85 million Android apps, it’s currently a way to flood the Microsoft app store with a whole bunch of new content – and make sure the latest popular mobile apps are suddenly available on the platform. Though time will tell how good the experience (built on top of Intel Bridge) ultimately is.</p>
<p>Windows 11 arrives this holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The other week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility,</a> I spoke to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">a trio of executives</a> at top automotive companies about why they’re all so bullish about robotics. There are the obvious implications, of course. Automakers have long employed robotics for manufacturing – they were really ahead of the curve on those concerns about automating job loss. And then there’s the fact that self-driving cars are effectively robots.</p>
<p>Beyond that, however, it’s clear that car companies see robotics as a key investment in their future. What really struck me about the conversation, is how differently the three companies – Hyundai, Ford and Toyota – are approaching the space. If nothing else, it’s a sign that there’s plenty of opportunity here.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/robotics-roundup-4/">wrote quite a bit about Ford’s ambitions in the category</a> several roundups ago, including an interview with Mario Santillo, who joined us for the recent panel. As evidenced by the company’s recent investment in University of Michigan, Ford’s approach is largely research-based. The company wants to be in on the ground floor both in terms of technology and talent. Though when I pressed Santillo about acquisitions, however, (specifically as it pertains to Digit-maker, Agility), he told me, “that&#8217;s always something we&#8217;re looking at.” So don&#8217;t rule it of, especially as other car companies begin to lockdown big names in the category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1885677" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/atlas-gymnastics-boston-dynamics.gif" alt="atlas gymnastics boston dynamics" width="960" height="533" /></p>
<p>Hyundai, of course, made one of the biggest robotics acquisitions in recent memory, picking up Boston Dynamics after its short stint in the Softbank portfolio (the investment firm remains a shareholder). Of course, that post-Google time has been important for the company, seeing the commercialization of Spot and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">upcoming sale of Stretch.</a> Hyundai’s Ernestine Fu shed some more light for us on the deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">which officially closed this week</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>With New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles. Obviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2111206" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111206" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2111206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg" alt="Hyundai Tiger walking robot" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg 1079w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>As we discussed, the driving force in the Toyota Research Institute’s interest in the category Japan’s aging population. Eldercare forms the basis of much of what the company does in robotics, including some home robotics research that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/toyota-research-institute-shows-how-its-robotics-work-with-difficult-surfaces-in-the-home/"> it showed off this week</a> – specifically how its imaging can handle reflective and transparent surfaces. Both have traditionally been tricky for robotic systems.</p>

<p>As TRI’s Max Bajracharya told me,</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]n Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That’s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It’s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don’t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.</p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve been following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/nvidia-launches-its-isaac-sdk-to-help-democratize-ai-powered-robot-development/">NVIDIA’s Isaac software</a> for a while now, and the robotic simulation software <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-isaac-sim-on-omniverse-now-available-in-open-beta/">is available as an open beta</a>. Built on top of Omniverse, the software is designed to test a wide range of different camera and sensor capabilities for robotics. It&#8217;s a fascinate project and potentially a big deal for early-stage robotics startups.</p>
<p>Quick follow up to some funding last week from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/robotics-roundup-16/">a robots landscaping company</a>, I asked iRobot what’s going on with their Terra mower, which was delayed amid pandemic-related cuts. The company tells me there’s still no clear timeline for the indefinitely delayed robot.</p>

<p>Miso Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/hamburger-flipping-robotics-maker-miso-introduces-automated-beverage-dispenser/">continues to build out from Flippy</a>, the hamburger-flipping robot with an automated beverage dispenser. The machine, created with beverage dispenser manufacturer Lancer, fully automates the process, right down to adding the cap on the cup. No clear timeline on the product yet, however, but it’s fun to see some of these companies branch out in a given sector.</p>

<p>A pair of warehouse automation stories worth highlighting here. <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/17/2249041/0/en/Berkshire-Grey-Unveils-Next-Generation-of-Intelligent-Enterprise-Robotic-Picking-and-Advanced-Mobility-Solutions-to-Accelerate-Fulfillment.html">Berkshire Grey has unveiled</a> a bunch of new fulfillment robots. Per the company,</p>
<blockquote><p>This new generation of mobile robots offers increased fulfillment throughput at a lower cost point to enable shorter delivery times and support a larger number of SKUs. Unlike fixed conveyor belts and early generation mobile robots, Berkshire Grey’s intelligent fleets harness the power of AI to orchestrate tens to thousands of mobile robots to pick, organize, and deliver items for a wide variety of customer and store orders.</p></blockquote>

<p>The company will tell you the same thing as every robotics maker: it&#8217;s all about helping retailers compete with the behemoth that is Amazon. Fittingly, the ecommerce giant also showed off <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/new-technologies-to-improve-amazon-employee-safety">some new robots this week</a>. Amazon says it&#8217;s utilized 350,000 mobile drive units since the company acquired Kiva Systems, which formed the foundation for its Amazon Robotics wing. The post has caused <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/whats-going-on-with-amazons-hightech-warehouse-robots">some to wonder</a> whether, in spite of a head start and some massive funding, whether the company is beginning to fall behind a number of aggressive warehouse robotics startups.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hjZtBvsmVY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Not a ton of funding news this week, but that should change soon. Hot bot summer is nearly upon us. I feel it in the air. Meantime,  please enjoy this submersible drone designed to track a wide range of creators in the mesopelagic &#8220;twilight&#8221; zone. Developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/whoi-uro061621.php">Mesobot</a> is designed to observe zooplankton, gelatinous animals and more, without disturbing their habitat. Here&#8217;s Senior Scientist Dana Yoerger,</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect that Mesobot will emerge as a vital tool for observing midwater organisms for extended periods, as well as rapidly identifying species observed from vessel biosonars. Because Mesobot can survey, track, and record compelling imagery, we hope to reveal previously unknown behaviors, species interactions, morphological structures, and the use of bioluminescence.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy Windows 11 day. Microsoft is giving us our best look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-announces-windows-11-generally-available-by-the-holidays/">yet at its upcoming operating system</a>, which is due out over the holidays. Following a year when the vast majority of our interpersonal communications arrived through computer and phone screens, the company is putting its communication software front and center.</p>
<p>Windows 11 will have Microsoft Teams built in, in a bid to compete more directly with communication platforms like Apple’s FaceTime. And like FaceTime, the key here is cross-device integration, making the service more hardware-agnostic as people move from desktop to mobile and back again.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169899" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169899" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="846" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg 1224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-090728.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an era when we&#8217;ve got more video chat platforms than we know what to do with, it&#8217;s hard to shake the feeling that we might be seeing the final nail in the coffin for the once-mighty Skype, which the company bought way back in 2011 for $8.5 billion. As it tried to do with Skype, Microsoft is looking to blur the line between consumers and professionals with the platform.</p>
<p>All versions of the new operating system will have Teams baked directly into the Start menu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After weeks of leaks and hype, Microsoft today officially <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/introducing-windows-11/">announced Windows 11</a>, the next version of its desktop operating system. While the company may have once said that Windows 10 was the last version of Windows, forgoing major point launches for a regular cadence of bi-annual upgrades, but it clearly believes that the changes &#8212; and especially the redesigned user interface &#8212; in this update warrant a new version number.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to release <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11">Windows 11</a> to the general public by the holidays, so we can probably expect it sometime around late November. Before that, we&#8217;ll likely see a slew of public betas, starting next week. It&#8217;ll be a free update to Windows 10 users.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh9643c2P6k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you followed along with the development and eventual demise of Windows 10X, Microsoft&#8217;s operating system with a simplified user interface for dual- and (eventually) single-screen laptops, a lot of what you&#8217;re seeing here will feel familiar, down to the redesigned Start menu. Indeed, if somebody showed you screenshots of Windows 11 and early previews of Windows 10X, you&#8217;d have a hard time telling them apart.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169816" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169816" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>As Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the overall idea behind the design is to make you feel &#8220;an incredible sense of calm,&#8221; but at the same time, the Windows team has also worked to make it a lot faster. Windows Updates, for example, are supposed to be 40 percent faster, but Panay also noted that starting up your machine and even browsing should feel much faster.</p>

<p>One surprise feature here is that you will now also be able to run Android apps on Windows. These apps will seem like native apps that can be integrated into the taskbar, for example. These apps will be in the redesigned Microsoft Store, via &#8212; you want to sit down for this &#8212; the Amazon Appstore. Didn&#8217;t see that coming, did you?</p>

<p>Besides the new user interface, which makes copious use of translucency and shadows and new features for touch screen users, one of the core new UI features is what Microsoft calls Snap Layouts, which pops up a small widget when you hover over the icon that maximizes your window to allow you to move the window to any corner, something that previously involved dragging your window to the corner of your screen (which was often hard when you used multiple screens).</p>

<p>Another major new feature is that Windows 11 will come with Teams built-in from the outset. It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft is bullish when it comes to Teams. It recently launched the consumer version of Teams, so it makes sense to now bring it to Windows 11, too. It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft never brought Skype to Windows, so this is quite a change, but it basically makes Teams Microsoft&#8217;s Facetime.</p>

<p>If you saw the Windows 11 leaks, you know that web widgets are one of the more visible new features. &#8220;Windows widgets is a new, personalized feed, powered by AI, serving you curated content,&#8221; Panay said. Widgets aren&#8217;t a new thing, of course, and in many ways, they make up for the removal of Live Tiles in the Start Menu. They&#8217;ll also give developers a new canvas to surface information from their applications.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be a new Windows without Microsoft talking about gaming, of course. The company argues that Windows 11 will &#8220;deliver the best PC gaming experience yet,&#8221; but what else would they say?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169849" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169849" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft promises better graphics thanks to Auto HDR, a feature that&#8217;s already available on Xbox. Thousands of games, Microsoft says, will be automatically enhanced with Auto HDR on Windows 11. In addition, the company argues that thanks to a new storage API in Windows 11, games will be able to quickly load game assets without bogging down the CPU (but it&#8217;ll take a compatible PC to do so). Oh, and Microsoft&#8217;s Game Pass subscription will be built right into Windows 11, too.</p>

<p>As expected, there will be a new Microsoft Store, too, which Panay said was built from the ground up for speed (because speed was what people were complaining about?). Panay argues that Microsoft wants to help developers bring more of their applications to the store. One area where Microsoft is obviously trying to set itself apart from Apple is that it will allow developers to use their own commerce engine in their apps and that Microsoft will not take any cut from that.</p>

<p>Indeed, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he wants developers to have the opportunity to build their own platforms on Windows 11. &#8220;Windows is the stage for the world&#8217;s creation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With this new version of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. [&#8230;] Today, the world needs a more open platform &#8211; one that allows apps to become platforms in their own rights. Windows is the platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born &#8212; like the web. That&#8217;s our aspiration with Windows 11.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happs, an app that lets creators stream live video simultaneously across social platforms, has raised $4.7 million in a post-seed round. The product originally began as a platform for independent journalists, but expanded its mission last year to offer tools to all online creators while connecting them through a new social network.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Bullpen Capital and Crosslink, Goodwater, Corazon, Rob Hayes of First Round Capital and Bangaly Kaba, previously at Instagram and Sequoia, also participated.</p>
<p>What sets <a href="https://about.happs.tv/?redirect_source=happs">Happs</a> apart from some established competitors in the space is the team&#8217;s desire to not only build tools that help video creators produce professional-looking online streams, but to cultivate a kind of meta-community that brings people together from across other social media sites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We kind of view this as the essence of what the creator economy is all about,&#8221; Happs CEO Mark Goldman told TechCrunch. &#8220;The idea of locking creators into an individual platform is a very traditional way of thinking about content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2169799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?w=680" alt="Happs app multistreaming" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png 2646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=2048,1223 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Like Goldman, the other co-founders, David Neuman and Drew Shepard, come from the media world. Goldman was the founding COO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/currenttv/">Current TV</a>, an experimental TV channel that dabbled in user-generated content and eventually sold to Al Jazeera in 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole idea was to democratize media and open it up,&#8221; Goldman said of his time working on Current TV, which he connects directly to his interest in building Happs. &#8220;[We] loved the creativity unleashed by that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online creators tend to be siloed within the app where they&#8217;ve built the biggest community, but Happs wants to empower them to reach as many followers as possible in a platform-agnostic way. For creators, the appeal with multistreaming is maximizing reach while making content efficiently. There&#8217;s a risk of alienating YouTube followers at the expense of your Twitch community if you don&#8217;t play your cards right, but some savvy content creators have turned toward the model to grow their audiences.</p>
<p>Happs connects people across platforms in a few ways. For one, Happs users can broadcast live to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Twitch simultaneously. The app also collects live comments from all supported social media sites and beams them into its own interface where they appear in a continuous cross-platform stream.</p>
<p>The integrated comment feature is nice built-in option for anyone who&#8217;s straddled comments across multiple devices simultaneously while livestreaming, which is no easy feat. When you&#8217;re streaming live you can feature a comment so that followers can see it on the screen no matter what platform they&#8217;re watching on.</p>
<p>Other companies in the space like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS,</a> <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/restream-raises-50m-to-help-creators-program-and-stream-to-multiple-platforms/">Restream</a> are focused on the tools part of the equation, offering power users a useful backend for pushing out multi-streamed live video. <a href="https://streamyard.com/">Streamyard</a> also offers multistreaming to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other platforms through a simple browser interface.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Restream raises $50M to help creators program and stream to multiple platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/restream-raises-50m-to-help-creators-program-and-stream-to-multiple-platforms/embed/#?secret=sLOKiL8mS3" data-secret="sLOKiL8mS3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike those services, Happs feels more like a social network, with familiar features like user profile photos, follower counts and a feed next to a &#8220;go live&#8221; button. Anyone can use the multi-streaming platform through its iOS or Android apps or a web interface, whether they&#8217;re a creator signing up for the tools or a fan looking to support the content they love.</p>
<p>Happs lacks some of its competitors&#8217; bells and whistles, stuff like fancy customized graphics and lower-thirds, but has a few interesting tricks of its own. While streaming live on Happs, you can invite someone else on the app to join your feed for a real-time collaboration. The social networking elements are meant to encourage cross-platform creativity, so a YouTuber and a Twitch personality could hang out together and boost both of their reaches, all while streaming to a bunch of other apps.</p>
<p>Happs also offers users monetization tools from the get-go, with no requirements before they can start making money. That speaks to the app&#8217;s appeal for creators who might be less established or just starting out. Happs could be a much harder sell for a popular creator deeply invested in a platform like Twitch, which has rules against multi-streaming for most accounts that are allowed to monetize.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to monetize. One lets anyone on Happs sponsor a broadcaster through regular monthly payments. The other is a one-off option that lets you chip in an award for any livestream, or to the VOD (video on demand) after the fact. The in-app currency is a virtual coin that users can buy or earn through doing stuff on the app. There are no plans for ads (yet, anyway).</p>
<p>The company will take 30% cut of subscription earnings, though according to Goldman they&#8217;ll be waiving those fees for an unspecified period of time to attract people to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised this round to really build up product and tech team [and] to make the platform much more stable and reliable,&#8221; Goldman said. The company is looking forward to leveraging the new resources to &#8220;really go out now and get in front of creators so they know Happs exists.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few spaces have grown hotter in the past year than the creator economy has, but for all of the new tools available to those starting a podcast, newsletter or storefront, most players have been more focused on building out their own platform opportunity rather than selling full independence to creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://spore.build/">Spore</a> wants to transform the creator web experience into a Shopify-like basket of tools that users tap into to connect with their audience across a variety of mediums. Spore CEO Austin Hallock is looking to compete with other creator giants for the &#8220;link in bio&#8221; real estate on social media sites with a white-label option that uses a creator&#8217;s own URL, selling an easy-to-build hub focused solely on connecting personalities with their fans.</p>
<p>With Spore, users can manage their audience, communicate with them and analyze what is and isn&#8217;t working.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform allows for blasting out newsletter updates, podcasts or texts while embedding functionality like storefronts or Discord-like chat feeds into their sites to keep the interactions going 24/7. Creators can also use the tool to convert free subscribers to paying ones, managing the payments flow while also building flows to allow creators to send certain content to their paying fans.</p>
<p>The small startup has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by SignalFire with additional participation from Justin Kan &amp; Robin Chan&#8217;s GOAT, Canaan, Lenny Rachitsky, Nathan Baschez, Justin Waldron and Dave Nemetz, among others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169807" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169807" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169807" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png 1974w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169807" class="wp-caption-text">Spore&#8217;s creator platform backend</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first lead investment for former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine in his role at SignalFire (full disclosure: I used to work closely with Josh). Constine started using Spore to build out a site for his regular show on Clubhouse, fellow investor Justin Kan also grew familiar with the team by building out a website for his podcast and YouTube channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose Spore as my first lead investment as a VC because it solves creators’ biggest problems by giving them their own white-labeled website they control, and combining all the best content, communication, analytics, and payment tools so creators can spend their time making art instead of being web developers,&#8221; Constine tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Spore is certainly a small-scale operation at the moment with 4 full-time employees, though they&#8217;re hoping to grow their team with this raise. All of these features are in their early MVP stages, but Hallock wants his company to continue building out its utility to creators so that they can build a direct connection with their fans, one that isn&#8217;t obfuscated by algorithms..</p>
<p>&#8220;We definitely want to give creators ownership,&#8221; Hallock tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Today, you&#8217;re promoting your Linktree page or Patreon rather than just promoting your own brand&#8230; We don&#8217;t want it to be about Spore.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content is king, as the saying goes. But in actual fact, a lot of what companies do today with content, and thus the power of that content, is relatively limited by the tools that exist to present it. That is slowly changing, and now a startup called <a href="https://www.sanity.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanity</a>, which has built a system to make it easier to repurpose and use content assets across a number of places, and to more easily use data as content, is announcing $39 million in funding on the back of strong demand for its tech.</p>
<p>This round, a Series B, is led by ICONIQ Growth (the growth round investment arm of the storied ICONIQ, backed by a number of high profile family offices including that of Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg). Lead Edge Capital, Threshold Ventures, Heavybit, and Alliance Venture are also in this round, some of which also participated in Sanity&#8217;s previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/sanity-a-platform-to-build-and-manage-content-flows-on-sites-raises-9-3m-from-ev-williams-threshold-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.3 million fundraise</a> in October 2020.</p>
<p>This latest investment brings the total raised by Sanity to $51.8 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Magnus Hillestad, Sanity&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said the company was &#8220;very happy&#8221; with the number. In any case, it comes on the back of some very strong growth. Sanity is now being used by almost 100,000 developers, marketers, content creators and product professionals, the company said, with &#8220;active users&#8221; numbering at 30,000 (double the number of active users the company had in October, he said). Customers include the likes of National Geographic, Puma, InVision, Datastax and Brex &#8212; who are using it to manage their content repositories and letting them flexibly use information across a range of endpoints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Headless&#8221; has become a big theme in the world of technology, covering services as varied as content (by way of content management systems, commerce, banking and financial services. Organizations that want to buy systems to, say, build websites without putting a lot of investment into design can use platforms that both help them manage the content of the sites, as well as the look of them. But some might want a more customized experience, and they will opt for headless offerings, where there are systems still built to help automate and manage data at the backend, but giving them the ability to design front ends that are tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<p>In Hillestad&#8217;s view, the rise of headless services has been an important development, but what Sanity has conceived of is the next step in extensibility: a platform that lets you use content on the fly in a number of ways without people having to work on that in separate systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking a programmatic approach to content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What businesses need now are not just marketing, or product, or e-commerce experiences.&#8221; These are all converging, he believes, &#8220;So you need to be able to build experiences to catch people wherever they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is content, but content is also data. If you think about what we are doing, what we are giving companies is a content lake,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Like data lakes, a content lake is structured, yet schema-less.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">This in turn gives companies the ability to use it across a number of use cases. This is notable because typically content is stored in silos created for specific purposes, part of the limitation of how CMS systems, even typical headless CMS systems, are conceived and built.</p>
<p>For now, there are however also limitations in Sanity: the company has yet to come up with interesting ways to enable translations between, say, audio and printed content, although that would appear to be a logical step for the company to take as it grows, given how many consumers already switch between different kinds of media formats.</p>
<p class="p4">“In an era of digital globalization, companies must rapidly deliver complex, multi-channel, and engaging digital experiences to reach customers wherever they are. This is forcing them to rethink the CMS. At the same time, developers are increasingly leading the adoption of new technologies and holding the keys to adapt effectively to this shift,” said Doug Pepper, general partner at ICONIQ Growth, who is joining the board with this round. “Sanity has created the hero product for building innovative product experiences, with an impressive developer-oriented approach to content delivery and a personalized product experience that breaks down silos for content creators, marketing and developer teams. We&#8217;re excited to support the Sanity team as they enter this next phase of growth.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[News that the firm is making $2.2 billion in capital available for crypto projects is driving this morning's headlines, but the dollar figure should not be a surprise.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big news in tech this morning is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">new a16z cryptocurrency-focused fund</a> totaling some $2.2 billion. The new investment vehicle is worth around four times what the company&#8217;s preceding crypto fund &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">its second</a> &#8212; was worth.</p>
<p>Andreessen&#8217;s wager on cryptocurrency is only accelerating over time as the investing house raises larger funds focused on the market with less time between them.</p>

<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why a16z is so enthused about the crypto market; its investments into trading house Coinbase paid off handsomely this year when the unicorn direct listed at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">huge valuation premium</a> to its previous worth. Why not put more capital into a startup cohort that was recently immensely lucrative?</p>

We can tell that much from the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/06/24/crypto-fund-iii/">short post</a> announcing its new fund. Mix in a recent interview with a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen concerning the American regulatory environment, and we can understand that the firm is not simply planning a flurry of new deals.</p>
<h2>Defending the future of crypto</h2>
<p>The headline figure of $2.2 billion in capital available for crypto projects is driving headlines this morning, but the dollar figure should not be a surprise. There&#8217;s essentially infinite money in the market for name-brand venture capital firms today, it appears, and with a16z&#8217;s recent Coinbase win, I doubt it was monstrously difficult for the firm to compile a new, larger crypto-focused vehicle.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deliver code ever faster, they need tooling to provide some semblance of control and governance over the cloud resources being used to deliver it. <a href="https://www.env0.com/">Env0</a>, a startup that is helping companies do just that, announced a $17 million Series A today.</p>
<p>M12, Microsoft’s Venture Fund, led the round with participation from previous investors Boldstart Ventures, Grove Ventures and Crescendo Ventures. The company received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/">a $3.3 million seed round</a>, which we covered, last April and a previously unannounced $3.5 million add-on last summer. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $23.8 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service helps companies control cloud costs, while giving developers the ability to deploy to the cloud with cost limits. It also provides a level of governance for code as it moves through the development cycle to deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When we spoke to the company last April<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/"> around its seed round</a>, the company&#8217;s product was just entering beta. It has been generally available for about 4 months now and they&#8217;ve built out a lot of functionality since then, according to company co-founder and CEO Ohad Maislish.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time we spoke we were just focussed on manual self service and empowering developers in non production environments. Now with infrastructure as code automation and teams and governance, we basically manage all of the cloud deployments for our customers,&#8221; Maislish explained.</p>
<p>Since going generally available with the product this year, he reports the company now has dozens of paying customers and is generating revenue. Customers includes JFrog, Varonis and BigID.</p>
<p>The startup has also grown from just 7 employees in April 2020 to 17 today with plans to reach 50 in the next 18 months it begins putting the new capital to work. He says that bringing in a diverse group of workers should help his company grow and bring different ways of solving problems. &#8220;I think that bringing people with different cultures, different backgrounds, is key in that they will bring [different ways of thinking].&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the company is based in Israel with plans to open offices in the U.S.. Mailslish says that his plans to move to California were put on hold by the pandemic, but he hopes to open an office in Sunnyvale in the fall.</p>
<p>The Israeli office is a minimum of two days in the office, three days at home or whatever combination employees wish. He says that he plans to hire people in the U.S. office as he establishes himself there and some of those employees can be remote if it makes sense for the role.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The business operation automation startup's CEO says the new capital will give it the space it needs to hire and build faster than if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business operation automation startup <a href="https://tonkean.com/">Tonkean</a> announced this morning that it closed a $50 million Series B round of capital. Accel led the round, which came just over a year after the startup <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tonkean-closes-24m-series-a-to-automate-operations/">raised a $24 million Series A</a>. Lightspeed Ventures, which led the company&#8217;s preceding venture capital round, also participated in its new funding event.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/esbsagi?lang=en">Sagi Eliyahu</a>, Tonkean&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview that his company&#8217;s valuation rose by around 4x in its latest funding round.</p>
<p>The startup was able to secure more capital at a higher price thanks in part to quick growth in 2020, which Eliyahu said was concentrated in the second half of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tonkean is an interesting mix of business process automation, no-code and humans. In short, the startup allows a company&#8217;s ops groups &#8212; sales ops, marketing ops, etc. &#8212; to set up automated business logic across applications that can include human-in-the-loop elements. And Tonkean built its system to be IT-friendly, allowing it to support enterprise-scale customers.</p>
<p>The automation space has been broadly hot in recent quarters. Robotic process automation (RPA) is great for mechanizing repetitive tasks that waste human time. The method of using computers to do stuff that humans previously had to do by clicking far too much has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">proven to be big business</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/embed/#?secret=TrnbToiERV" data-secret="TrnbToiERV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>

<p>Tonkean allows for something a bit different. An example may help: During our interview, Eliyahu mused about what might happen if a salesperson for a Tonkean client wanted to send a lead into a nurture campaign. Tonkean would let the sales ops team set up logic so that when the frontline salesperson selects the lead for a nurture effort inside their CRM, the lead would then automatically be added to a specific Marketo campaign. Furthermore, the click-to-nurture system would alert a human on the sales team, perhaps asking for approval of the decision.</p>
<p>Tonkean software employs no-code tools to let ops groups use off-the-shelf command modules to build business logic &#8212; or craft their own as needed. The use of the company&#8217;s software could allow for more empowered teams at companies that are less reliant on engineering groups for help in accelerating and automating their work.</p>
<p>That thematically fits inside the general narrative we&#8217;ve seen from no-code startups in general: They want to allow non-technical folks to have more control of their work through less reliance on technical teams at their place of employment.</p>
<p>Tonkean employs around 60 people today, up from around 15 folks at the time of its Series A. It plans to hire rapidly now that it has more capital. Eliyahu claims most of its Series A is still in the bank. So why did it raise?</p>
<p>Because Eliyahu considers his startup&#8217;s market to be so large that he wants to pull the company&#8217;s future closer to today; the new capital will give Tonkean the space it needs to hire more rapidly and build more quickly than it might have if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case.</p>
<p>Fifty million dollars is a lot of money. Let&#8217;s see how far it gets Tonkean. The next time we talk to the company, we&#8217;ll demand some harder growth metrics so we can see if the additional capital was the accelerant that the company hopes it will be.</p>
