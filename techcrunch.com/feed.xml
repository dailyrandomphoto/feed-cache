										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today is rolling out an update to its Access Your Information tool with the goal of making the tool easier to both use and navigate, as well as better explain how and why that data is used. The new version of the tool has been visually redesigned, and now further breaks down the viewable information across eight different categories instead of just two.</p>
<p>The tool had first launched in 2018 in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal, when the personal data of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/">up to 87 million Facebook users</a> had been hijacked. Following that event, Facebook made a number of changes to how its platform apps worked and rolled out new features to make it easier for users to find and utilize Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings.</p>
<p>One of the new additions was this Access Your Information tool, which offers users a secure way to manage their Facebook posts, reactions, comments and other things they&#8217;ve searched for. The idea is that you could use the tool to pull up your information, then &#8220;delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before, this tool offered just two broad categories of data: Your Information and Information About You. The updated version, on the other hand, has broken this out to eight categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Activity Across Facebook</li>
<li>Friends and Followers</li>
<li>Preferences</li>
<li>Personal Information</li>
<li>Logged Information</li>
<li>Ads Information</li>
<li>Apps and Websites Off Of Facebook</li>
<li>Security and Login Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each of these eight categories, the information is then further broken down into subcategories. This makes it easier to more narrowly drill down to just the sort of data you want to view and, possibly, remove.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095153" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095153" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="360" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png 2262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=2048,1083 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AYI-sample-screens.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, the tool is introducing Search functionality with the update. You can find data categories by searching them &#8212; like by typing in &#8220;location&#8221; to pull up information about your location history.</p>
<p>The tool will also now better explain how this data Facebook has can be used to personalize your experience on its platform. For example, you might see your primary location is one of the signals that was used to target you with an ad for a food delivery app. (Facebook already explains this in its Why Am I Seeing This tool for ads, but now it&#8217;s in this tool, too.)</p>
<p>Facebook says the changes were developed based on how people had been using the tool &#8212; especially in terms of what categories of data they were clicking on.</p>
<p>That said, the timing of the tool&#8217;s revamp is notable. There&#8217;s a large effort at Apple underway to better highlight to App Store users which apps collect personal data which is then used to track them. Apple is now requiring apps to add App Store privacy labels and will soon require apps to get user consent on tracking.</p>
<p>Facebook, in response to this push, launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a website</a> and ran full-page ads in newspapers to gain support for its personalized advertising business, noting the harms it says will come to small businesses as a result of Apple&#8217;s changes.</p>
<p>This revamped tool will help make Facebook&#8217;s case to users, as well, by explaining the why the data and the ads could be useful. (After all, isn&#8217;t it better to see a food delivery ad for a company that actually serves your local area?, Facebook would want you to think.)</p>
<p>Then there is the not-so-small-matter of people who may be trying to rapidly delete their incriminating Facebook history &#8212; like photos and videos of themselves inside the Capitol during last week&#8217;s riot, perhaps. Now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/politics/capitol-arrests.html">the FBI is filing federal charges</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol">dozens more are being charged in Superior Court</a>, people may be rethinking their decision to share their participation in the event so publicly. The tool could help there, too.</p>
<p>Facebook, when asked, said the enhancements are just a usability update, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We may finally have an answer to why Byju’s, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/silver-lake-leads-500-million-round-in-indias-byjus/">world’s most valuable edtech startup</a>, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/indian-education-startup-byjus-raises-200m-from-general-atlantic/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> last year.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/byju-s-said-to-pay-1-billion-for-blackstone-backed-india-tutor?sref=gni836kR">reports</a> that the Bangalore-based startup has agreed to buy Aakash Educational Services, which owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges.</p>
<p>According to the publication, Byju’s will pay $1 billion to buy Aakash Educational Services, which was founded in 1988 and serves more than 250,000 students. Aakash sold 37.5% stake to Blackstone in late 2019 in a deal that valued the Indian firm at about $500 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Byju’s spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Byju’s has raised over $800 million in the past two years, and more than doubled its valuation to over $11 billion. The startup, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">several other edtech firms</a> in India, attracted tens of millions of students to its platform last year after the pandemic prompted New Delhi to shut down schools nationwide.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake. The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/byjus-profitable-fy-2019/">turned profitable in late 2019</a>, served over 70 million students as of late last year.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/indian-decacorn-byjus-ceo-talks-about-future-acquisitions-coronavirus-and-international-expansion/">interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last year</a>, Byju’s co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the startup, which acquired a coding platform aimed at young students called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">WhiteHat Jr for $300 million last year</a>, was open to more merger and acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by several high-profile investors, including Bond, which was co-founded by Mary Meeker. Bond expects Byju’s to be worth over $30 billion within three years, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch earlier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://roboflow.com/">Roboflow</a>, a startup that aims to simplify the process of building computer vision models, today announced that it has raised a $2.1 million seed round co-led by Lachy Groom and Craft Ventures. Additional investors include Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, Lob CEO Leore Avidar, Firebase co-founder James Tamplin and early Dropbox engineer Aston Motes, among others. The company is a graduate of this year&#8217;s Y Combinator summer class.</p>
<p>Co-founded by <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Nelson (CEO) and Brad Dwyer (CTO), Roboflow is the result of the team members&#8217; previous work on AR and AI apps, including <a href="http://magicsudoku.com/">Magic Sudoku</a> from 2017. After respectively exiting their last companies, the two co-founders teamed up again to launch a new AR project, this time with a focus on board games. In 2019, the team actually participated in the TC Disrupt hackathon to add chess support to that app &#8212; but in the process, the team also realized that it was spending a lot of time trying to solve the same problems that everybody else in the computer vision field was facing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094898" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pills-live-detection.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094898" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2094898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pills-live-detection.gif?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roboflow</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In building both those [AR] products, we realized most of our time wasn&#8217;t spent on the board game part of it, it was spent on the image management, the annotation management, the understanding of &#8216;do we have enough images of white queens, for example? Do we have enough images from this angle or this angle? Are the rooms brighter or darker?&#8217; This data mining of understanding in visual imagery is really underdeveloped. We had built a bunch of &#8212; at the time &#8212; internal tooling to make this easier for us,&#8221; Nelson explained. &#8220;And in the process of building this company, of trying to make software features for real-world objects, realize that developers didn&#8217;t need inspiration. They needed tooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>So shortly after participating in the hackathon, the founders started putting together the first version of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roboflow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roboflow">Roboflow <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and launched the first version a year ago in January 2020. And while the service started out as a platform for managing large image data sets, it has since grown to become an end-to-end solution for handling image management, analysis, pre-processing and augmentation, up to building the image recognition models and putting them into production. As Nelson noted, while the team didn&#8217;t set out to build an end-to-end solution, its users kept pushing the team to add more features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094910" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094910" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094910" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png" alt="" width="1024" height="527" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png 3578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chess_preprocess_augmentation.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094910" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roboflow</p></div></p>
<p>So far, about 20,000 developers have used the service, with use cases ranging from accelerating cancer research to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/reducing-traffic-with-computer-vision/">smart city applications</a>. The thesis here, Nelson said, is that computer vision is going to be useful for every single industry. But not every company has the in-house expertise to set up the infrastructure for building models and putting it into production, so Roboflow aims to provide an easy to use platform for this that individual developers and (over time) large enterprise teams can use to quickly iterate on their ideas.</p>
<p>Roboflow plans to use the new funding to expand its team, which currently consists of five members, both on the engineering and go-to-market side.</p>

<p>&#8220;As small cameras become cheaper and cheaper, we&#8217;re starting to see an explosion of video and image data everywhere,&#8221; Segment co-founder and Roboflow investor French-Owen noted. &#8220;Historically, it&#8217;s been hard for anyone but the biggest tech companies to harness this data, and actually turn it into a valuable product. Roboflow is building the pipelines for the rest of us. They’re helping engineers take the data that tells a thousand words, and giving them the power to turn that data into recommendations and insights.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today — and the data proves this — if you are a white male, you have an unfair advantage when looking to raise venture capital. This doesn’t take anything away from the brilliant white male entrepreneurs that have built incredible companies, but it has made an equivalent crowd of Black founders almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>As a nation we know the benefits of encouraging entrepreneurship across backgrounds: Entrepreneurs create jobs, spark innovation and allow us to maintain our position as the most competitive nation on the planet. It’s in our national interests to make becoming an entrepreneur as egalitarian as possible, and yet we’ve fallen remarkably short of that goal across both race and gender.</p>
<p>I moved to southern China shortly after graduating from UC Berkeley. A lot of my decision-making process at the time was more subconscious, but I always had this feeling that as a Black male, I wasn’t going to get fair treatment working for a large company; I always knew my path to success was through being an entrepreneur and creating my own company. China, not the U.S., seemed the place to do that.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the entrepreneurial spirit of China. And surprisingly, as a foreigner in China, I felt that I wasn’t judged in the context of race. They saw me as an American that could bring them business opportunities and that was it, I felt that I was judged more on the merits of the value that I could bring than I would in the U.S. — and it was refreshing. Spurred by opportunities, I started a successful import and export business in China, and after a few years I had over 30 employees. I loved the experience of working with factories and I found it mesmerizing watching products that we use and wear being made.</p>
<p>At that time, my clients were larger U.S.-based retailers and brands. I could see the growth of Shopify and how this deceptively simple e-commerce product, plus marketing tools like Instagram, allowed small businesses to sell online and market their products in ways that had only been accessible to my larger clients years before. But I kept thinking that there was no equivalent inroad for small businesses to vast resources of supply chain and manufacturing.</p>
<p>That was the reason I founded <a href="http://thestudio.com">The/Studio,</a> a custom manufacturing platform that would give small businesses access to factories so that they could easily manufacture products in low quantities, without having to deal with all of the hassle and risks associated with manufacturing — just like the big brands.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t even know that raising venture capital was a possibility. And really, this was where my race became an obstacle. Those closer to the concentric circles of venture capital know that venture capital exists and they know how to access it.</p>
<p>Those that are further away don’t know how it truly can scale your company, let alone how to access it. Now, when you have a commodity like capital that is a closely held resource to a favored few, that’s called elitism and cronyism. I believe it’s the antithesis of what Silicon Valley is supposed to stand for and it’s detrimental to America’s ability to lead on a global, entrepreneurial scale.</p>
<p>By 2016, without capital, I had bootstrapped the company to eight digits in revenue. We had more than 100 employees and the business was profitable. I knew that there was a much larger opportunity for us to take advantage of — the same one Shopify seized on — but I felt that I didn’t have the financial resources, nor the knowledge at the time, to really grow the business in the way that I thought was possible or responsible.</p>
<p>It was at this time that I started to understand that at this point in a technology company’s trajectory, they really need venture capital to put fuel to the fire. Not just for the money, though that helps — we needed the counsel and guidance that often comes with it, too.</p>
<p>So I upped and moved to San Francisco. I was very optimistic that it would be easy for my company to raise millions of dollars in venture capital — after all, I was used to reading in TechCrunch about companies that were raising millions of dollars, and sometimes tens of millions of dollars, with no product, just a good idea (and sometimes a bad one). I’d proven my ability as an entrepreneur by already building a sizable business with a massive TAM, plus a product that was live, already profitable and ready to be scaled.</p>
<p>I started off with several introductions that one of my friends from college and a former VC made for me to several of his previous colleagues. In the traditional Silicon Valley way, I would take one introduction and turn it into another. I began to realize that venture capital is a bit of a social game — and I was about to play it for two years.</p>

<p>During this process, I want to be clear that I never faced overt racism; everyone was polite and gracious with their time. But when going to pitch meetings and VC events, I got the same feeling that I would get when you go to a high-end country club or a luxury store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. It was clear that the venture community — and the few entrepreneurs that they anointed to be part of their chosen — were a closely knit elite who wanted nothing to do with outsiders.</p>
<p>An air of arrogance, elitism and exclusivity pervaded literally every interaction. They spoke a certain way, they were looking for cues of who else you knew in their network — and the minute that they discovered that you were not one of them, the meeting was basically over. This feeling was in stark contrast with what in my mind Silicon Valley had stood for. I had envisioned an ideal where any brilliant, hard-working entrepreneur with a good idea and was scrappy as hell could raise money and find success.</p>
<p>In reality, it was a place where your admittance to the club was heavily based on your race, gender and what university you went to (even UC Berkeley wasn’t highly regarded). If you weren’t white, male and from Harvard, Stanford or the Ivies, you had to relentlessly pursue your vision for years to get in through the back door.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-studio" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="the-studio">The/Studio <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did finally raise an $11 million series A — after 18 months and 150 meetings and 145 &#8220;no’s.&#8221; Read that again. I was mostly pitching white male VCs. Their prejudgements and the fact that you don’t know their friends made it a “no” before the meeting even started. The wider data suggests strongly that there was a racial component to this, as does my personal napkin math: Roughly 120 of the VCs I pitched were white and we got zero term sheets from them. Thirty that I pitched were ethnic minorities and I received five term sheets, or a success rate of 17%.</p>
<p>Two years later, I’ve become part of that exclusive group of entrepreneurs that have raised a sizable venture capital round. And I now have a behind-the-scenes view of what Silicon Valley is all about. There are some truly brilliant investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and the data backs that up; the number of VC-backed companies that go public in Silicon Valley dwarf the rest of the nation for a good reason.</p>
<p>But I’ve also learned that there are a lot of incompetent investors that are investors simply because of who they know, and a lot of entrepreneurs that aren’t the best in the world who get funded because of who they know. In addition, I’ve met a lot of people that would be great investors that never will have the opportunity to be investors, because of who they don’t know and how they look. Likewise, I know many great entrepreneurs, just as good as the ones that have taken major companies public, that won’t raise VC money because of who they don’t know and how they look.</p>
<p>I do believe there is a deep-seated perception in Silicon Valley that people that look a certain way and have a certain pedigree are the best entrepreneurs. The system is set up in a way that reinforces this mentality with a positive feedback loop: The VC structure is set up in a way that they make money off of 10% of their deals and the other 90% can fail, no problem.</p>
<p>If they invest in someone that is unknown within their social circles, they run the risk of being challenged by their partnership on why they made that decision, so the personal risk of going out on a limb is big. If they invest in someone that has a ton of social credibility in Silicon Valley, then even if they fail, nobody will question them. It’s part of the process.</p>
<p>VCs are only human, and if you have billions of dollars of capital to deploy and thousands of entrepreneurs that want to raise money from you, and you can only select a few a year, it’s easy to take the resistance-free route and invest in people that you know. Those people are generally white males. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because statistically if you invest in predominantly white males and a few of them succeed, then invest in far fewer people of color or women, even fewer of them will succeed. You end up internalizing that bias in your mathematically “objective” decision-making.</p>
<p>We saw this same issue begin to be resolved for women in the last decade. There were very few female entrepreneurs who raised VC money 10 years ago — 823 women-owned businesses, according to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/11/12/the-number-of-venture-capital-backed-companies-with-female-founders-is-on-the-rise/?sh=2e6ae44c3bc3">recent Forbes study</a>. There are still very few female-led VC-backed companies today, compared to male-led ones, but there are a lot more now; over 3,450 as of 2019, according to the same study. Women didn’t get smarter in 10 years; pressure was applied to VCs and they started being less myopic.</p>
<p>They realized that women made great entrepreneurs — and investors, too. During the last decade, more VC firms began hiring — and were started — by women, <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201810/kimberly-weisul/female-founders-funding-guide.html">although even now it’s still a meager 11%</a>.</p>
<p>But what about the racial divide? I know a brilliant Black guy that has a master’s degree in electrical engineering and computer science from one of the top five engineering schools in the nation, heads an engineering team for a company that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and has created a high-tech startup serving enterprise customers, doing over $1 million a year in revenue, is profitable and totally bootstrapped. I’m confident that if he were a white male, he would have already raised significant VC money. He hasn’t.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t think it’s a matter of overt racism. But he probably isn’t accepted and doesn’t feel comfortable in VC social circles; he probably doesn’t have the confidence that he can raise money; he hasn’t seen others that look like him raise money. Because he lacks these things and because he doesn’t have the traditional “entrepreneur look,” he would be dismissed by VCs.</p>
<p>Now, all this being said, change begins with entrepreneurs, too. For instance, we recently launched a new product called <a href="https://suppliedshop.com/">Supplied</a> that allows small businesses and boutiques to buy products wholesale directly from factories in China. About 95% of our customers are women — and 60% of our customers are people of color.</p>
<p>We didn’t set out to build a product for this market, but once they embraced it, we embraced them. Initially, my board, which is all white and male, didn’t understand this market and was a bit cautious. I don’t blame them; there was nothing nefarious about their assumptions or initial concerns, they just didn’t have the experience in their life that helped them to understand our customer.</p>
<p>But I did, at least the racial challenges faced by our customer base. I had conviction that there was a business here because I know a lot of women of color that had similar experiences and aspirations as the customers that were gravitating toward our platform, only to be shut out by prohibitively high prices on other “wholesale” platforms.</p>
<p>And I recognized my own inability to fully understand our customer base, as well as the fact that my team wasn’t diverse enough to really understand them, either. So I deliberately tried to recruit more women into our organization. I’m now proud to say that my executive leadership is 33% female, 33% Black, 77% people of color. The team that runs Supplied is predominantly female, just like the customer base.</p>
<p>Both The/Studio and Supplied’s head of marketing are Black women, with one working from Nigeria and the other from Ghana. Our diversity numbers are far better than almost any tech company I’ve encountered. Diversity isn’t something we just talk about; it comes naturally to us, because diversity comes naturally to me.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley has created incredible outcomes, and I don’t want to unfairly malign Silicon Valley as this racist institution that deliberately keeps out minorities and women. But because of many factors — which do include overt racism, historical factors and just human nature — the fact remains that Silicon Valley does not reflect our nation’s diversity across race and gender. Yet.</p>
<p>Our country is becoming more diverse and the rest of the world more wealthy. For Silicon Valley to maintain its crown as a beacon of innovation, it’s important to make it more diverse so it can understand the United States as well as emerging markets. It doesn’t need to be a zero-sum game where more people of color will push out the incumbents. In fact, it will make things more competitive, with a more diverse perspective on the world, which is better for returns and opportunities for all.</p>
<p>Blacks founders and other underrepresented groups also have an obligation to pull up their bootstraps and pursue being entrepreneurs and being funded, no matter how hard it is. This generation will serve as the inspiration — and employer — of the next. The more Black people who get funding, the more Black entrepreneurialism becomes normalized, creating a flywheel effect of normalizing investing in Black founders for VCs and encouraging more Black people to pursue being entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that equal access to capital and entrepreneurship is the final civil rights movement. We have an opportunity to create real equality — financial and social — in Silicon Valley and the world, all while building the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart announced today it will soon begin to pilot a new solution that could eventually allow the retailer to deliver groceries to customers&#8217; homes 24 hours per day. The company is partnering with <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/">HomeValet</a>, the maker of a temperature-controlled smart box that&#8217;s placed outside the home. Customers&#8217; groceries can be delivered, contact-free, to the secure box and kept cold at any time &#8212; even if the customer isn&#8217;t at home.</p>
<p>The smart boxes will be tested initially with customers near Walmart&#8217;s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, starting this spring. There won&#8217;t be a way to sign up for the service. Instead, Walmart will conduct outreach to its current delivery customers in Northwest Arkansas to learn of their interest in participating.</p>
<p>The HomeValet boxes themselves are an internet-of-things platform which offer three temperature-controlled zones, making them capable of storing frozen, refrigerated and pantry items. The boxes communicate with the delivery provider&#8217;s device, which gives them secure access to the smart box at the time of the delivery to place the items inside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the HomeValet <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/faqs">FAQ</a>, the boxes also disinfect the exposed surfaces of delivered items as well as the inside of the box itself, in between deliveries, using UVC light.</p>
<p>This could appeal to customers who have been trying to reduce their exposure to the novel coronavirus by wiping down all their groceries before putting them away. (The HomeValet website, however, makes no specific claims about COVID-19. Instead, it simply says the UV-C LED disinfection method it uses can create &#8220;inhospitable environments to microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, molds and other pathogens.&#8221;)</p>
<p>HomeValet notes that Walmart customers will be the first to gain access to its boxes, as the product is just now going to market. The general public will be able to pre-order boxes for themselves later this year, with pricing still to be announced. HomeValet intends to eventually sell to both consumers and retailers.</p>
<p>HomeValet, a D.C. Metro area-based startup, was founded by father and son team, John and Jack Simms, years before the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of offering more secure home deliveries. However, the pandemic <a href="https://www.tysonsreporter.com/2020/09/24/tysons-secure-home-delivery-startup-plans-to-launch-this-fall/">created a new sense of urgency inside the company</a> to get their product to market as consumers&#8217; needs transformed overnight and continued at an accelerated pace, they&#8217;ve said.</p>
<p>As a result, HomeValet <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/tysons-contactless-delivery-tech-company-buys-ind-based-firm/">acquired an Indiana-based engineering firm</a>, Envolve Engineering LLC, founded by former Whirlpool engineers, back in September. The company <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/tysons-contactless-delivery-tech-company-buys-ind-based-firm/">touted</a> the deal at the time as a way to bring the capabilities of a Fortune 500 organization to its faster and more nimble startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers want convenience and peace of mind now more than ever. HomeValet’s safe, temperature-controlled Smart Box and app, can enable 24/7 secure deliveries whether customers are occupied at home or receiving remotely,&#8221; said John Simms, HomeValet co-founder and CEO. &#8220;We’re excited for Walmart customers to be some of the first to enjoy contactless, unattended home delivery,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Though Walmart envisions how a smart box could allow it to expand its delivery hours, it won&#8217;t be offering 24/7 deliveries during the pilot. Instead, the focus of the pilot will be to learn more about if and how its customers like to interact with this technology and how Walmart might incorporate it into its operations going forward.</p>
<p>HomeValet is one of many solutions to date that Walmart has tested to make grocery delivery more efficient. Not all those tests have rolled out broadly. For example, Walmart in 2019 began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/walmart-to-launch-in-home-grocery-delivery-in-three-cities-starting-this-fall/">to trial an in-home grocery delivery service</a> that allows Walmart delivery drivers to enter the home through a smart lock system and, in some cases, put groceries away in the customer&#8217;s fridge. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/aug/26/walmart-halts-in-home-deliveries/">Walmart pulled back </a>on the in-kitchen program, which is still only operating in Pittsburgh. (InHome delivery is also offered in Kansas City, Vero Beach and West Palm Beach, but groceries are left inside the door.)</p>
<p>Walmart didn&#8217;t disclose further details about the nature of its partnership with HomeValet, but said there&#8217;s no cost to the customers during the pilot period. More information will be available as the program goes to launch in the spring.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Uber has expanded a program that incentivizes drivers to use all-electric and hybrid vehicles to more than 1,400 cities in North America including Austin, Houston, Miami and New York City as part of the ride-hailing company&#8217;s broader plan to become a zero-emission platform by 2040. The program, known as Uber Green, gives customers the option [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has expanded a program that incentivizes drivers to use all-electric and hybrid vehicles to more than 1,400 cities in North America including Austin, Houston, Miami and New York City as part of the ride-hailing company&#8217;s broader plan to become a zero-emission platform by 2040.</p>
<p>The program, known as <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/ubergreen/#:~:text=Each%20time%20you%20choose%20Uber,vehicles%20(EVs)%20by%202025.">Uber Green</a>, gives customers the option to request an EV or hybrid electric vehicle. Drivers receive an extra $0.50 from a $1 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed. Uber said Tuesday it is integrating the program into its Uber Pass membership service and will give members 10% off on &#8220;green&#8221; trips, the same discount provided for a standard ride.</p>
<p>Of course, the success of Uber Green hinges on its ability to get drivers to make the switch. The company has set aside $800 million to get its drivers to use electric vehicles by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s beginning to roll out programs through partnerships with automakers, charging network <span style="font-weight: 400;">providers, and EV rental and fleet companies to provide further incentives. Uber said Tuesday drivers in Los Angeles can rent electric vehicles through a partnership with Avis. The program will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand nationwide in 2021.  </span></p>
<p>Uber has also partnered with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample. Starting this month, drivers in San Francisco </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can rent a vehicle with Ample battery swapping technology, which lets switch out the electric vehicle batteries in minutes. </span></p>
<p>The company has also expanded its partnership with EVgo to give drivers on its ride-hailing platform access to charging discounts at more than 800 U.S. locations.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s zero-emission goal will require more than getting drivers and riders to use EVs. The company is expanding other programs as well, including its journey planning feature for public transit users. The feature, which is now available in more than 40 cities globally, is accessed through the Uber app and lets users plan their public transit journey and includes walking directions to stations and real-time schedules. The company said Tuesday it has added the feature for users in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta, Auckland, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Philadelphia, Rome, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai. </span></p>
<p>Uber said it is also bringing a multimodal trip planner that combines ride-hailing with walking <span style="font-weight: 400;">directions and city bus, subway, or train connections to Mexico City and London. The feature launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Sydney and Chicago. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps these companies would have merely stayed private sans SPACs. If that's true, two cheers for blank-check companies?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are a number of ways to take a private company public: You can pursue a traditional IPO, sell a chunk of shares at a set price and start trading. You can direct list, and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did.</p>
<p>Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the blank-check method: Instead of taking <em>your</em> company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead, and then go hunting for a private company to merge with. If you consent, the money bucket and your actual company merge, renaming themselves after your operating entity. This is a SPAC-led debut.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re discussing today, because there are a few upstarts going public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs, or blank-check companies) worth checking out.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One deals with bitcoin, and one is a huge consumer-facing fintech that has <a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/">a stadium</a> named after itself. In the case of <a href="https://www.bakkt.com/">Bakkt</a>, the cryptocurrency-powering entity, a SPAC made some sense at first blush. <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, on the surface, seemed less obvious. (Bakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an exchange-focused, public company. It has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/03/19/bakkt-crypto-exchange-boosted-by-300m-from-microsoft-ice-during-crisis/?sh=15d362ab72c7">raised money from Microsoft</a> as well.)</p>
<p>This morning I want to dig through the two offerings&#8217; investor presentations to see what we can learn. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/">viewing the Opendoor-SPAC presentation</a>, I had a few questions heading into the new deals. The first of which was whether SPACs were going to be used again to lift potentially-promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories to the public markets? If so, perhaps SPACs would wind up helping get more total companies public, which would not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Especially given how many unicorns the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">private markets are birthing</a> ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">the public market&#8217;s ability to IPO them all</a>; maybe SPACs would help close the liquidity gap?</p>
<p>So, does that very modest hypothesis fit with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bakkt" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bakkt">Bakkt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and SoFi? And what can Bakkt tell us about Coinbase&#8217;s impending IPO and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="social-finance">SoFi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the state of consumer fintech? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>SPAC me baby one more time</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with Bakkt. You can read its release, including all the messy details of a SPAC-led combination <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210111005532/en/Bakkt-the-Digital-Asset-Marketplace-Launched-by-Intercontinental-Exchange-in-2018-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-Merger-with-VPC-Impact-Acquisition-Holdings">here</a>. The piece you need to know is that the resulting, combined company will have an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp">enterprise value</a> of around $2.1 billion and more than $500 million in cash after all elements of the deal are closed.</p>
<p>So the market should soon have a publicly-traded, cryptocurrency-focused business that is loaded with cash. Fun!</p>
<p>Next we want to know how healthy Bakkt is as a business, which brings us to its investor presentation, which you can read <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bakkt-Management-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. The presentation stresses that Bakkt is backed by major companies, a plus for public investors who might still be skittish about bitcoin. It also stresses that Bakkt will handle a host of digital tokens instead of <em>just</em> cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bakkt&#8217;s point that airline miles and other non-monetary rewards are <em>related</em> to decentralized cryptocurrencies in that they are digital tokens is worth considering. Bakkt views the breadth of its supported asset classes as both an advantage over its competitors, and something that it is expanding; equities trading is coming soon, which will users to view even more of their digitally-held assets in one place.</p>
<p>Then we get to the results section of the presentation, which includes what I think is the most egregious chart of all time:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095088" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095088" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095088 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="319" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=768,361 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095088" class="wp-caption-text">Akin to calling One America News Network &#8220;conservative,&#8221; this chart stretches the word&#8217;s definition somewhat.</p></div></p>
<p>Observe how competitors are denoted with <em>actual</em> data, while Bakkt bests them all with <em>projections. </em>Oof. So when it comes to what we can learn today from Bakkt about the impending Coinbase IPO I think that the answer is &#8220;not much.&#8221; Oh well.</p>
<p>We raise the above chart not merely to gently mock some of its embedded optimism, but also to note how nascent Bakkt&#8217;s consumer app really is. Per the company itself, it has yet to <em>really</em> launch:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?w=476" alt="" width="476" height="192" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></p>
<p>This leads to the &#8220;results&#8221; shared being pretty heavy on speculation. Indeed, they are <em>nearly</em> <em>all speculation</em>. Check it out:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has launched a new business unit to offer commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products, the latest effort in the company&#8217;s ambitious $27 billion bid to become a leading electric automaker.</p>
<p>The new business called BrightDrop, which officially launched Tuesday during the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop has other products in mind and is tinkering with a few concepts, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">medium-distance vehicle that transports multiple electric pallets known as EP1 as well as a rapid load delivery vehicle concept, which was teased Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095107" style="width: 1926px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095107" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095107 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1916" height="968" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg 1916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM/screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a vehicle play, however. GM has also developed a suite of software tools to offer an EV ecosystem for the commercial marketplace. It&#8217;s also setting up a dealership network to support sales and service and plans to help commercial customers set up charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud-based software platform, which can be accessed on the web or by mobile app, will give users information to improve operations, including the best delivery routes and other fleet management features, according to GM. The electric van and pallet will have an array of connected features designed to give customers better ways to monitor and manage the vehicles, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">location monitoring, battery status and remote commands to lock and unlock. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095087" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095087" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095087 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095087" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>BrightDrop is the latest &#8220;startup&#8221; to spin out of the automaker&#8217;s Global Innovation effort, an in-house organization that has led to the launch of <span style="font-weight: 400;">OnStar Insurance, OnStar Guardian and GM Defense. Travis Katz, who was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Redpoint Ventures, has been named CEO and president of BrightDrop. </span></p>
<p>The idea for BrightDrop was sparked by a team within the Global Innovation organization that was evaluating the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for online delivery, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more we learned about the demand and the challenges of delivery and logistics from that first mile to literally the last five feet, the more we saw the opportunity to leverage GM&#8217;s expertise in things like electrification, mobility applications, telematics, fleet management to help businesses move goods and services in a smarter and more sustainable way,&#8221; Pam Fletcher, vice president of Global Innovation at General Motors, said in a media briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>That opportunity is a substantial one, based on GM&#8217;s estimates. The automaker said that by <span style="font-weight: 400;">2025, the combined market opportunity for parcel, food delivery and reverse logistics in the U.S. will be more than $850 billion. Demand for urban last-mile delivery is expected to grow by 78% by 2030, leading to a 36% increase in delivery vehicles in the world&#8217;s top 100 cities, according to the World Economic Forum. At the same time, this increase in demand is expected to cause delivery-related carbon emissions to rise by nearly one-third.</span></p>
<h2>The EP1</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2095086" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095086" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095086 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095086" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>The business unit&#8217;s first product is called the EP1, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a propulsion-assisted, electric pallet developed to move goods over short distances. For instance, it might be used to shuttle goods from a warehouse to a delivery van. The pod will be available in early 2021.</span></p>
<p>The EP1 has a built-in electric hub motor that can travel up to 3 miles per hour. The pod&#8217;s speed will adjust depending on the operator&#8217;s walking pace.</p>
<p>The EP1, which GM says it&#8217;s designed to maneuver in tight spaces, can about 23 cubic feet of cargo space and carry a payload of up to 200 pounds. Inside the pod are adjustable shelves and lockable cabinet doors to allow for remote access to whatever goods are being transported.</p>
<p>FedEx recently completed a pilot program testing the EP1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">FedEx Express couriers were able to safely handle 25% more packages per day with the EP1s, according to GM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrightDrop and FedEx Express have another pilot scheduled to take place in a major urban center in the U.S. this quarter. </span></p>
<h2>The EV600</h2>

<p>The electric delivery van is a vehicle designed and built off of GM&#8217;s Ultium architecture — the heart of the company&#8217;s EV strategy. The first vans will be delivered to FedEx at the end of this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">BrightDrop expects to make the EV600s available to more customers to order starting in early 2022.</span></p>
<p>The vehicle will be able to travel an <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated 250 miles on a single charge. Its peak </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charge rate will be up to 170 miles of EV range per hour via 120kW DC fast charging, according to GM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The inside is roomy with <span style="font-weight: 400;">600 cubic feet of cargo area and comes with a security system to keep goods safe. There is a 13.4-inch-diagonal, full-color infotainment screen, front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The electric van comes standard with advanced driver assistance tech found in its consumer vehicles, including f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ront and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking and other warnings to keep the driver in the lane. The van also comes standard with a forward collision alert, following distance indicator, front pedestrian braking and  automatic high beams and HD Rear Vision Camera.</span></p>
<p>Customers can pump up the safety features and add options such as r<span style="font-weight: 400;">ear cross traffic braking, blind zone steering assist, reverse automatic braking, HD surround vision, rear pedestrian alert and enhanced automatic emergency braking.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">America is a land of paperwork, and nowhere is that more obvious than at the end of someone’s life. Advanced care directives have to be carefully disseminated to healthcare providers and strictly followed. Property has to be divided and transferred while meeting relevant estate laws. And of course, there are the logistics of a funeral, cremation or other option that has its own serious complexities, costs and choices.</p>
<p>The worst time to figure out how to die is when you die. The best time to figure it out is precisely when you don’t have to.</p>
<p>For New York City-headquartered <a href="https://lantern.co">Lantern</a>, the goal is to initiate those conversations early and give its users significantly better peace-of-mind, particularly in these dolorous times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company offers essentially a “how-to” platform for beginning to prepare for end-of-life, offering checklists and monitoring to ensure that the vast majority of details are figured out in advance. In some cases, the startup will handle the underlying details itself, while in other areas like estate planning, it works with partners such as Trust &amp; Will, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trust-will-raises-15m-as-digital-estate-planning-hits-mainstream/">which we have profiled a number of times on TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the company has two plans: a simple free one and a $27 / year plan that tracks your progress on end-of-life planning and allows you to collaborate with family, friends or whoever else needs to be part of your decision-making. The company is in the process of adding other à la carte options for additional fees.</p>
<p>Last month, the company raised $1.4 million in a seed round led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/draper-associates-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="draper-associates-2">Draper Associates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with a few other firms involved. Earlier, the company raised a pre-seed round of $890,000 from the likes of 2048 Ventures, Amplify and others, bringing its total fundraised to date to $2.3 million. The company is organized as a public-benefit corporation and was founded in September 2018 and first launched a year later.</p>
<p>For founders Liz Eddy and Alyssa Ruderman, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lantern-co" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lantern-co">Lantern <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was an opportunity to tackle a looming problem in a compassionate and empathetic way. “I started my first company when I was 15,” Eddy, who is CEO, said. That company focused on dating abuse and domestic violence education for high school and later college students. “I really fell in love with the pace and variety of starting something new, but also in creating conversations around topics that people really don&#8217;t want to talk about and making it more palatable and comfortable,“ she said.</p>

<p>Later, she joined local suicide prevention non-profit <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org">Crisis Text Line</a>, which has an SMS-based network of crisis counselors who are trained to calm people and begin their process of recovery. She spent more than six years at the organization.</p>
<p>As for Ruderman, who is COO of Lantern, she most recently spent two years at Global Citizen, a non-profit organization focused on ending extreme poverty. The two connected and incubated Lantern at startup accelerator Grand Central Tech.</p>
<p>The idea for better end-of-life planning came from personal experience. “I lost my dad when I was in elementary school,” Eddy said, “and saw firsthand how loss and grief impacts a family financially, emotionally, logistically, legally — every aspect.”</p>
<p>Today, many of these processes are offline, and the online products mostly available today are focused on individual elements of end-of-life planning, such as estate planning or selecting and purchasing a casket. Eddy and Ruderman saw an opportunity to provide a more holistic experience with a better product while also initiating these conversations earlier.</p>
<p>That pre-planning part of the product was launched just as the pandemic was getting underway last year, and Eddy said that “we had a sort of a really interesting launch where people were starting to come to terms with their own mortality in a way we hadn&#8217;t seen in a very long time.” Typical users so far have been between 25 and 35 years old, and many people start planning when they have a major life event. Eddy says that the death of a family member is an obvious trigger, but so is having a baby or starting a company.</p>
<p>One aspect that Eddy emphasized repeatedly was that having a will and pre-planning for end-of-life are not equivalent. “Even if you don&#8217;t have a dollar to your name after you pass away, there are a ton of other things that your loved ones, family members, whoever&#8217;s responsible has to consider,” she said.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, there are some nuances compared to your more typical SaaS startup. For one, the company needs to engage you regularly, but not too frequently. Unlike, say, a wedding which is a single event that then is over, your documents and directives need to be occasionally edited and updated as a user’s life circumstances change.</p>
<p>Beyond that, one of the largest challenges with a product that talks about death is building a connection with a user that doesn’t seem cold, and, well, Silicon Valley-like. “Even as a product that is entirely virtual, making sure that you really feel that human connection throughout” is a high priority, Eddy said. “We use a lot of empathetic language, and our imagery, all of the illustrations are done by illustrators who have lost someone in memory of the person who&#8217;s lost.”</p>
<p>Longevity startups may remain a thesis for some VC investors, but handling the end — no matter when — is an activity every person faces. Lantern might shine just a bit more light on what is otherwise a debilitating and scary prospect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, have been on a fundraising roll for the last couple of years. Today the company announced a $160 million Series E on a fat $2 billion valuation. The round comes just eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">the startup raised an $86.6</a> million Series D.</p>
<p>The latest investment was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/altimeter-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="altimeter-capital">Altimeter Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from new investors Greenoaks and Lone Pine along with existing investors Benchmark, Bond, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures and Tiger Global. The round doubled the company&#8217;s previous valuation and increased the amount raised to $355 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Spenser Kimball says that the company&#8217;s revenue more than doubled in 2020 in spite of COVID, and that caught the attention of investors. He attributed this paradoxical rise to the rapid shift to the cloud brought on by the pandemic that many people in the industry have seen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People became more aggressive with what was already underway, a real move to embrace the cloud to build the next generation of applications and services, and that&#8217;s really fundamentally where we are,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>As that happened, the company began a shift in thinking. While it has embraced an open source version of CockroachDB along with a 30-day free trial on the company&#8217;s cloud service as ways to attract new customers to the top of the funnel, it wants to try a new approach.</p>
<p>In fact, it plans to replace the 30 day trial with a newer version later this year without any time limits. It believes this will attract more developers to the platform and enable them to see the full set of features without having to enter credit card information. What&#8217;s more, by taking this approach it should end up costing the company less money to support the free tier.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we expect is that you can do all kinds of things on that free tier. You can do a hackathon, any kind of hobby project [&#8230;] or even a startup that has ambitions to be the next DoorDash or Airbnb,&#8221; he said. As he points out, there&#8217;s a point where early stage companies don&#8217;t have many users, and can remain in the free tier until they achieve product-market fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when they put a credit card down, and they can extend beyond the free tier threshold and pay for what they use,&#8221; he said. The newer free tier is still in the beta testing phase, but will be rolled out during this year.</p>
<p>Kimball says that company wasn&#8217;t necessarily looking to raise, although he knew that it would continue to need more cash on the balance sheet to run with giant competitors like Oracle, AWS and the other big cloud vendors, along with a slew of other database startups. As the company&#8217;s revenue grows, he certainly sees an IPO in its future, but he doesn&#8217;t see it happening this year.</p>

<p>The startup ended the year with 200 employees and Kimball expects to double that by the end of this year. He says growing a diverse group of employees takes good internal data and building a welcoming and inclusive culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the starting point for anything you want to optimize in a business is to make sure that you have the metrics in front of you, and that you&#8217;re constantly looking at them [&#8230;] in order to measure how you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The thing that we&#8217;re most focused on in terms of action is really building the culture of the company appropriately and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing for all six years we&#8217;ve been around. To the extent that you have an inclusive environment where people actually really view the value of respect, that helps with diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimball says he sees a different approach to running the business when the pandemic ends with some small percentage going into the office regularly and others coming for quarterly visits, but he doesn&#8217;t see a full return to the office post-pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and pharmaceutical company Moderna have <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005245/en/Uber-and-Moderna-Collaborate-to-Raise-Awareness-and-Increase-Access-to-COVID-19-Vaccines">announced a partnership</a> around COVID-19 vaccination, which will include a number of different initiatives. To start, it&#8217;s only confirmed component is to provide users with credible, factual information about COVID-19 vaccine safety through Uber&#8217;s consumer app, but the companies have also discussed additional &#8220;options&#8221; including building ride scheduling via Uber directly into the immunization appointment booking process.</p>
<p>Still in its early days, the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is already beset with challenges, including providing timely access to vaccines to swaths of the population who need it most. The inoculation program also has to contend with significant misinformation proliferating on social media about vaccine safety, and any app with the surface area of something like Uber has a chance to get positive messages and accurate information in front of a lot of people, so that&#8217;s good news on its own.</p>
<p>But one of the very real challenges to an effective vaccination campaign remains logistical, and getting people to make their initial and follow-up appointments for the first round of the Moderna vaccine, and its second shot booster, is a bigger challenge than many might suspect. I spoke to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthvana" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthvana">Healthvana <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Ramin Bastani about their work with  LA County on creating an immunization record that integrates with Apple Wallet to provide patients with timely info and reminders about vaccination appointments, but integrating a ride-booking service or appointment reminder directly in the Uber app that most users already have on their phone anyway could be another very effective way to increase success rates for first and follow-up inoculation visits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Uber has already <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/10-million-rides/">offered up free and discounted rides</a> to help lower the friction of actually going out and getting a vaccine, but a product-level integration could do a lot more than that by providing easy, user-friendly access. As noted, this is still just one of the options being discussed, but if Uber and Moderna are willing to commit it to print, that at least means they&#8217;re serious about trying to find a way. We&#8217;re holding them to account, too, so rest assured we&#8217;ll follow up on their progress as this collaboration develops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The maker of a defunct cloud photo storage app that pivoted to selling facial recognition services has been ordered to delete user data and any algorithms trained on it, under the terms of an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers">FTC settlement</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator investigated complaints the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ever-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ever-2">Ever <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> app &#8212; which gained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/photo-app-ever-removed-its-spammy-sms-feature-after-apple-banned-it/">earlier notoriety</a> for using dark patterns to spam users&#8217; contacts &#8212; had applied facial recognition to users&#8217; photographs without properly informing them what it was doing with their selfies.</p>
<p>Under the proposed settlement, Ever must delete photos and videos of users who deactivated their accounts and also delete all face embeddings (i.e. data related to facial features which can be used for facial recognition purposes) that it derived from photos of users who did not give express consent to such a use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moreover, it must delete any facial recognition models or algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos.</p>
<p>This full suite of deletion requirements &#8212; not just data but anything derived from it and trained off of it &#8212; is causing great excitement in legal and tech policy circles, with experts suggesting it could have implications for  other facial recognition software trained on data that wasn&#8217;t lawfully processed.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, tech giants that surreptitiously harvest data to train AIs could find their algorithms in hot water with the US regulator.</p>

<p>The quick background here is that the Ever app shut down last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/">August</a>, claiming it had been squeezed out of the market by increased competition from tech giants like Apple and Google.</p>
<p>However the move followed an investigation by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371">NBC News</a> &#8212; which in 2019 reported that app maker Everalbum had pivoted to selling facial recognition services to private companies, law enforcement and the military (using the brand name Paravision) &#8212; apparently repurposing people&#8217;s family snaps to train face reading AIs.</p>
<p>NBC reported Ever had only added a &#8220;brief reference&#8221; to the new use in its privacy policy after journalists contacted it to ask questions about the pivot in April of that year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers">press release</a> yesterday, reported earlier by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225171/ftc-facial-recognition-ever-settled-paravision-privacy-photos">The Verge</a>, the FTC announced the proposed settlement with Ever received unanimous backing from commissioners.</p>
<p>One commissioner, Rohit Chopra, issued a standalone <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1585858/updated_final_chopra_statement_on_everalbum_for_circulation.pdf">statement</a> in which he warns that current gen facial recognition technology is &#8220;fundamentally flawed and reinforces harmful biases&#8221;, saying he supports &#8220;efforts to enact moratoria or otherwise severely restrict its use&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until such time, it is critical that the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meaningfully enforce existing law to deprive wrongdoers of technologies they build through unlawful collection of Americans’ facial images and likenesses,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Chopra&#8217;s statement highlights the fact that commissioners have previously voted to allow data protection law violators to retain algorithms and technologies that &#8220;derive much of their value from ill-gotten data&#8221;, as he puts it &#8212; flagging an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">earlier settlement with Google and YouTube</a> under which the tech giant was allowed to retain algorithms and other technologies &#8220;enhanced by illegally obtained data on children&#8221;.</p>
<p>And he dubs the Ever decision &#8220;an important course correction&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U41WksBSL2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">Children&#8217;s privacy costs just $170 million for Google in settlement with the FTC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Children&#8217;s privacy costs just $170 million for Google in settlement with the FTC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/embed/#?secret=U41WksBSL2" data-secret="U41WksBSL2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ever has not been fined under the settlement &#8212; something Chopra describes as &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; (saying it&#8217;s related to commissioners &#8220;not having restated this precedent into a rule under Section 18 of the FTC Act&#8221;).</p>
<p>He also highlights the fact that Ever avoided processing the facial data of a subset of users in States which have laws against facial recognition and the processing of biometric data &#8212; citing that as an example of &#8220;why it&#8217;s important to maintain States&#8217; authority to protect personal data&#8221;. (NB: Ever also avoided processing EU users&#8217; biometric data; another region with data protection laws.)</p>
<p>&#8220;With the tsunami of data being collected on individuals, we need all hands on deck to keep these companies in check,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;State and local governments have rightfully taken steps to enact bans, moratoria, and other restrictions on the use of these technologies. While special interests are actively lobbying for federal legislation to delete state data protection laws, it will be important for Congress to resist these efforts. Broad federal preemption would severely undercut this multifront approach and leave more consumers less protected.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be critical for the Commission, the states, and regulators around the globe to pursue additional enforcement actions to hold accountable providers of facial recognition technology who make false accuracy claims and engage in unfair, discriminatory conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ever-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ever-ai">Paravision <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been contacted for comment on the FTC settlement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer, a company that&#8217;s looking to develop an airline of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for use in urban transport, will work with automaker Fiat <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chrysler-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chrysler-2">Chrysler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automobiles (FCA) in a new partnership to benefit from the latter&#8217;s expertise in engineering, design, supply chain and materials science. Archer aims to start production of its eVTOLs at scale beginning in 2023, with an initial unveiling to occur early this year.</p>
<p>The new team-up will see FCA provide input that contributes to the design of Archer&#8217;s eVTOL cockpit, as well, another area where the automaker has ample expertise, since it has designed spaces for drivers for many decades in its automotive business. Archer&#8217;s aircraft will be powered by an electric motor, and will be able to fly for up to 60 miles at top speeds of 150 mph. The Archer eVTOL is designed to be quiet and efficient, with efforts from the FCA collaboration going towards lowering the cost of its manufacturing to make high-volume manufacturing achievable and sustainable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Archer is looking to FCA to help it realize efficiencies in its process that can make bringing its eVTOL to market a sound business that can also be accessed affordably by end users. Palo Alto-based Archer is looking to ultimately scale production to the point where it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/archer-taps-fcas-scale-and-expertise-to-accelerate-electric-vertical-take-off-and-landing-aircraft-evtol-production-301206056.html">can produce &#8220;thousands&#8221;</a> of its eVTOL aircraft per year, for use in future air taxi services serving cities globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based in Palo Alto and led by co-founders Brett Adcock and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/adam-goldstein" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="adam-goldstein">Adam Goldstein, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and including industry executives like Chief Engineer Goeff Bower, who previously served int hat role at Airbus&#8217; Vahana eVTOL initiative, Archer launched out of stealth earlier this year with backing from Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Walmart&#8217;s ecommerce business (he was co-founder and CEO of Jet when it was acquired by the retailer).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizations today &#8212; perhaps more than ever before &#8212; are relying on technology to help them figure out what the next weeks, months, and years will hold for their business at what has been one of the more tumultuous periods for our global economy in decades. Today, a company that is providing the platform to do that is announcing a significant fundraise to tap into that opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="http://jedox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jedox</a>, a German startup that builds tools to help companies with their financial planning and analysis using data sourced from basic documents like Excel spreadsheets, has picked up a funding of over $100 million &#8212; it&#8217;s not specifying exactly how much &#8212; in a round being led by Insight Partners, with Iris Capital, eCAPITAL, and Wecken &amp; Cie (all previous backers) also participating. The company currently works with some 2,500 customers including big players like Microsoft, McDonalds, and industrial giant ABB.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software was originally built to work on-premises or in the cloud, and mainly oriented towards financial planners. Over the last several years, Jedox has expanded that to a wider set of adjacent users, specifically in HR planning and procurement, and the plan with this funding is to expand Jedox&#8217;s applicability into an even wider set of use-cases and verticals. CEO Florian Winterstein &#8212; who joined the company in 2018 during its last fundraise &#8212; said that while Jedox the name doesn&#8217;t have any particular meaning, the company has landed on a focus on the &#8220;X&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to focus on more than just the finance department,&#8221; he said, and the company thinks of FPNA (financial planning and analysis) &#8220;as XPNA&#8221; as a result. Expanding beyond their original verticals &#8220;is what everyone in enterprise is doing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has raised around $150 million to date, and Winterstein said that Jedox is not disclosing its valuation with this round. But he confirmed that Insight took a majority investment, and that this funding comes on the heels of a lot of demand from financial and strategic investors to back the company. The company counts Microsoft and Salesforce (prolific strategic investors in the startup world) among its partners and sometime customers today &#8212; as well as acquisition offers from enterprise resource planning companies due to its traction and presence in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been approached tons of times, maybe every month, by companies from our space, from others in the area of financial services, and those looking for better tools to integrate into a wider suite of enterprise services,&#8221; he said. He called those approaches &#8220;interesting&#8221; but also said the startup was equally considering an IPO route in several years &#8212; the route that its closest competitor, Anaplan, has taken, he points out. In any case, there are no plans for an exit anytime soon with growth going strong.</p>
<p>Jedox got its start way back in 2002 and in a way is a very typical European startup story. Winterstein notes that its efforts were all open source-based and that the company was &#8220;not commercial at all, a lot of tech geeks and German engineering types that were not overly experienced in go-to-market strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>That started to change over time, with Winterstein coming in and the founders stepping away, and the company also making its own shift, away from the open source model among the many changes that have taken place. (The open source elements, however, as still alive and well, collected mostly around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_(OLAP_database)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palo</a> open source standard.) Jedox, Winterstein, is all-in in cloud services now, with SaaS making up 75% of its revenues, and the remainder mostly being about professional services related to that.</p>
<p>(The focus on professional services ushered by Winterstein is notable, considering his track record. Before this role, he led and founded a number of companies, two of which have been acquired by IBM, which arguably leads and dominates the market of building tech with professional services wrapped around it.)</p>
<p>For a lot of tech watchers and especially those in enterprise, these days when people talk about modelling, thoughts often spring immediately to artificial intelligence and things like big data machine learning, and that&#8217;s not too much of a surprise: AI is really the flavor of the month at the moment.</p>
<p>A lot of that, however, can be misleading. I&#8217;ve heard more than one tech person complain about how a lot of what is pitched and peddled as AI is not really that.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s quite refreshing is the Jedox does not try do that itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get kind of annoyed by ‘what is AI’,&#8221; he said when I brought this up. &#8220;It may be simple predictions and statistical modeling they are doing.&#8221; He is quick to say that &#8220;not everything we do is AI, and if you look at our customer distribution, roughly 100 of our 2,500 customers are really using AI. Others are using what others may call AI but in the definition of what AI actually is, it is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that Jedox is not without AI in its systems for modeling and giving a better picture of what might happen at a business when considering different factors, but that Jedox does not in all cases develop those algorithms itself.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There are around 20-25 algorithms out there and we don’t think it’s necessary to create the next algorithm,&#8221; he said. Instead, the company taps AI services provided by the likes of Google, Microsoft and others to run its services on a backbone, built by Jedox, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that throws user or customer data on various AI services and our backbone to figure out which algorithm suits the data and use case of the customer best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Companies like Palantir have really brought to light how modeling and predictive insights can be used to an organization&#8217;s advantage. Jedox&#8217;s unique selling point is that it&#8217;s doing something like this but on a more actionable basis for average workers.</p>
<p>“Jedox offers a differentiated approach to financial planning through its flexibility, familiar Excel-based interface and focus on the customer,” said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Florian and the Jedox team to bring market-leading cloud planning tools to industry leaders in every vertical, across the globe.&#8221; Rachel Geller, another MD at Insight Partners, and Henry Frankievich, principal, will be joining the board of directors with the round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technologists are getting better at coding biology and venture firms are flooding a new generation of startups with cash so that they can commercialize their technology bringing in the next wave of genetic innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tesseratherapeutics.com/">Tessera Therapeutics</a>, the Boston-based spinup from Flagship Pioneering, is the latest company to enter the mix with $230 million in new financing to build up its platform for better biological programming.</p>
<p>The round was led by Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., Altitude Life Science Ventures and the second SoftBank Vision Fund, with participation from the Qatari Investment Authority and other undisclosed investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, the company took the covers off of its gene writing service, which combined an array of different gene editing, manufacturing and synthesizing technologies to provide more tailored therapeutic instructions to genetic code.</p>
<p>By providing more instructions to genetic material, the company aims to increase the precision of therapies while expanding the number of potential pathogens or mutations they can target, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The thesis is similar to the approach taken by companies like Senti Bio, another early stage biotech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/senti-bio-raises-105-million-for-its-new-programmable-biology-platform-and-cancer-therapies/">which raised $105 million earlier this month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senti Bio raises $105 million for its new programmable biology platform and cancer therapies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/senti-bio-raises-105-million-for-its-new-programmable-biology-platform-and-cancer-therapies/embed/#?secret=P4o2nR0wmw" data-secret="P4o2nR0wmw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to write in the code of life will be a defining technology of this century and drive a fundamental change in medicine. Today’s support is a testament to Tessera’s outstanding team of scientists and our focus on bringing the extraordinary promise of Gene Writing to patients,” said Geoffrey von Maltzahn, CEO and Co-Founder of Tessera Therapeutics, and a partner at Flagship Pioneering. “We look forward to turning this powerful technology into a new category of medicines.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part of a number of companies focused on gene therapies and gene editing technologies that have been developed under the Flagship Pioneering umbrella, Tessera Therapeutics focuses on the development of new therapies that will use messenger RNA, targeted fusogenic vectors, and epitgenetic controllers, according to Flagship Pioneering founder and chief executive, Noubar Afeyan, who also serves as the chair and co-founder of Tessera.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Senti Bio is adding more programming to existing genetic material, Tessera uses mobile genetic elements, the most abundant genetic material in the body to create new vectors for writing and rewriting the human genome.</p>
<p>The company asserts that this represents a breakthrough in genetic engineering, that can build better therapies. That&#8217;s because the technology can target very specific sites in the genome to make any substitutions, insertions or deletions in genetic code. Tessera also said that its tech allows for more efficient engineering of somatic cell genomes without double stranded-breaks and with very little reliance on DNA repair pathways.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gene Writing is inspired by and builds upon the shoulders of nature’s most prevalent class of genes: mobile genetic elements. Tessera’s computational and high-throughput laboratory platform has enabled the team to design, build, and test thousands of engineered and synthetic mobile genetic elements for writing and rewriting the human genome.</p>
<p>The company said it can also write entirely new sequences into the genome by delivering only RNA.</p>
<p>With the new round of funding, Tessera said it would look to further develop its tech, hire more staff and establish manufacturing and automation capabilities critical for its platform and programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK SpaceTech startup <a href="https://www.skyrora.com/">Skyrora</a> is currently the only private company capable of launching rockets from UK soil. On Christmas Eve at its testing facility in Fife, Scotland, the team performed a third-stage static fire engine test onboard a new vehicle that will ultimately carry satellites to their final destination. But what’s more interesting is that the vehicle can refire it&#8217;s engine several times in orbit and conduct multiple missions in a single trip. This makes it a “Space Tug” able to perform a number of maneuvers in space including the extraction of space junk or maintenance if are satellites already in orbit.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/skyrora-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="skyrora-ltd">Skyrora <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> went rough one of the early Space Camp accelerator programme from Seraphim Capital.</p>
<p>The Space Tug is the first &#8220;mission ready&#8221; vehicle of its kind to be developed in the UK and once in orbit it can navigate to any location under its own power, with the ability to make multiple stops etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Space Tug is powered by a 3D-printed 3.5kN engine and the first stage of is launch is fueled using an eco-friendly fuel (Ecosene) made in part from waste plastics</p>
<p>Volodymyr Levykin, CEO Skyrora commented: &#8220;We have been deliberately quiet about this aspect of our Skyrora XL launch vehicle as we had huge technical challenges to get it to this stage and we wanted to ensure all tests had a satisfactory outcome, which they now have. With the current climate and a real shortage of good news, we feel it is the right time to share this with the world… We aim not only to conduct efficient launches from UK soil in the most environmentally friendly way, but then also to ensure that each single launch mission has the possibility of conducting the level of work that would have historically taken multiple launches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Tim Peake, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astronaut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astronaut">Astronaut, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commented: “It&#8217;s fantastic that companies such as Skyrora are persisting in their ambition to make the UK a “launch state”. By driving forward and constantly investing into their engineering capabilities, the UK continues to benefit from these impressive milestones achieved. In undertaking a full fire test of their third stage, which fulfils the function of an Orbital Manoeuvring Vehicle capable of delivering satellites into precision orbits, Skyrora is one step closer to launch readiness. This vehicle will also be able to perform vital services such as satellite removal, refuelling and replacement and debris removal from orbit.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the technology byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it has raised the game for businesses to have better digital tools in place to interface with customers, and their own work, to get things done. Today, a company called <a href="https://getjobber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobber</a>, which has built a platform doing just that for a particular segment of the market &#8212; home services professionals &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it finds its business growing.</p>
<p>The Canadian startup has picked up $60 million in funding. The equity round being led by Summit Partners, with participation also from previous backers OMERS Ventures and Version One Ventures, and new investors Tech Pioneers Fund.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s platform is focused around management software to help sole-traders and small home services businesses make appointments and organize their schedules, set up billing and manage their accounts, and market their services online. The funding round comes at a time when Jobber already some 100,000 customers across 47 countries and 50 service segments, including cleaning, electrical repairs, landscaping, plumbing and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That is but a small piece of the opportunity: Jobber estimates that home services and other tradespeople make up a workforce of some 5 million in the U.S. alone, contributing over $550 billion to the economy annually.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s rise comes at a key moment not just in the macroeconomic sense but also in the world of technology.</p>
<p>A vast swathe of businesses in a number of sectors &#8212; for example, finance, HR, medicine, commerce, education, and more &#8212; have spent decades adopting digital services to get their work done, a trend that has seen a big acceleration in the last year and the added intricacies that the coronavirus has brought to the working world.</p>
<p>But within that trend, one of the last holdouts has been the small business owner, and specifically those that work in very &#8220;hands-on&#8221; areas like home services, with many of them using mobile phones but little else in the way of technology to advertise themselves or run their operations.</p>
<p>That has seen a notable shift in the last year. Consumers are more than ever before using the internet to do business &#8212; whether that involves discovering companies or paying for goods and services &#8212; and tradespeople have found themselves also turning in that direction, not just to meet the changing demands of consumers, but also to keep themselves safe and in business. On top of that, the population of tradespeople themselves is getting younger and more digitally-native, and they are adopting and using these tools more naturally than their predecessors.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s growth, said CEO Sam Pillar (who co-founded the company with Forrest Zeisler, CTO) in an interview, is &#8220;being driven by a number of factors, not just the ages of homeowners but also the providers of these services.&#8221; He added that many of the kinds of services that home services people provide &#8212; home repairs, our housekeeping, are not typically the kind that disappear with a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two trends meant that home services professionals performed better than you would expect in the economy, and so did we,&#8221; Pillar said. &#8220;The younger generation of business owners starting or taking over companies are looking to figure out they will use to manage what is otherwise a mass of paper.&#8221; So offering them solutions that are user-friendly also makes a difference, he said.. &#8220;Even if they are comfortable with technology, they are busy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s funding comes as part of a bigger trend of startups building services for later adopters in the B2B world also getting a boost in their business &#8212; and attention from VCs.</p>
<p>They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hover</a>, building technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses, which secured $60 million in November. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a> in December raised $40 million for a platform to help all kinds of SMBs &#8212; key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time &#8212; build out and run their businesses.</p>
<p>The connecting thread with all three is the fact that they are tapping not just into wider &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; trends, but that the need for their particular services has really come into focus especially in the last year.</p>
<p>“We believe the home service category is in the early stages of a significant digital transformation – and Jobber is paving the way for thousands of small and mid-sized services businesses that are working to incorporate digital tools in order to keep pace with customer expectations,” said Colin Mistele, Principal at Summit Partners, in a statement. “The Jobber team blends strong product vision, data-driven market perspective and a customer-centric approach—a powerful combination that we believe will support the company’s continued rapid growth. We are thrilled to partner with the Jobber team – and we are excited about the future of this category.” Mistele is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation and had raised just $16 million before this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moving forward, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yelp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yelp">Yelp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users won&#8217;t just be asked whether a business has good food or accepts credit cards — the platform is also allowing them to share feedback on whether the staff is wearing masks and enforcing social distancing.</p>
<p>Yelp&#8217;s head of consumer product Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh suggested that this is the next phase of how the company is trying to help local businesses, after allowing them to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/yelp-virtual-services/">highlight virtual services</a>, manage their waitlists in accordance with new regulations and indicate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/yelp-adds-new-features-for-reopening-businesses/">the health and safety measures that they&#8217;re taking</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s one thing to see that a business claims to have strict mask-wearing and social distancing procedures, and another to hear other customers confirm that it&#8217;s true (or not). So Ramesh said it&#8217;s less about warning users away from certain businesses and more working &#8220;to continue to instill confidence in consumers to continue to connect with and support local businesses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When users visit a business profile they&#8217;ll now be asked whether social distancing was enforced and whether the staff wore masks — Ramesh said other health and safety questions could be added in the future (and users can offer slightly more detailed feedback on safety measures by hitting the Edit button in a profile), but those are the ones that users seem to care about the most.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094963" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094963" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?w=680" alt="Yelp health and safety" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg 2808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>When Yelp receives enough answers to offer present meaningful data (the company, understandably, isn&#8217;t disclosing the exact threshold), it will add a message in the health and safety section of the profile: “Social distancing enforced according to most users” with a green checkmark, or &#8220;Social distancing might not be enforced according to most users&#8221; with an orange question mark, with similar messages for mask-wearing.</p>
<p>In cases where the responses are mixed, but there&#8217;s still &#8220;significant&#8221; feedback indicating that these practices aren&#8217;t followed, the message will be attributed to &#8220;some users&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>Ramesh said that Yelp has already been collecting this user feedback, and at launch, only &#8220;a couple hundred&#8221; of the millions of businesses on Yelp will be marked with an orange label, &#8220;which also means that many businesses are doing the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094961" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094961" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2094961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GIF-of-Consumer-Feedback_Edit-Button-Flow.gif?w=415" alt="GIF of Yelp Consumer Feedback" width="415" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>He noted that in cases of multi-location businesses, the health and safety data will be specific to each location. Also, the labels will be based on feedback from the past 28 days — so if a business gets an orange label but starts doing better, their profile should eventually be updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>In addition, Yelp says it&#8217;s adding new service offerings and safety measures that businesses can include on their profiles, including checking staff for symptoms, disposable or contactless menus, heated outdoor seating and covered outdoor seating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year in, the Covid-19 global health pandemic continues to have something of a dragging effect on many aspects of life, but today a key bellwether for how technology is developing underscored how the industry continues to march on. The number of patents granted in the US in 2020 totaled 352,013, representing a decline of just under 1% compared to the year before (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/us-patents-hit-record-333530-granted-in-2019-ibm-samsung-not-the-faangs-lead-the-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final tally</a> for 2019 was 354,428 patents granted).</p>
<p>At the same time, patent applications rose almost 5% last year, a sign of how future years will likely see a boost in numbers again, according to <a href="https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-trends-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">figures from IFI Claims Patent Services</a>, which tracks applications and trends in patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. As with previous years, IBM led the pack in terms of number of patents granted in the year, but Samsung, in aggregate, continues to hold the most patents of any company.</p>
<p>“Overall, U.S. patent activity was down slightly last year, despite the pandemic. This is a minor downward tick in what’s been a largely upward trajectory we’ve seen over the past decade, and it’s still 13 percent higher than what we saw in 2018,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO of IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, in a statement. “Another positive indicator is that published pre-grant applications saw a nominal increase in 2020. But we’ll have to wait at least another year before we can determine if the pandemic had any impact.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Patents, and lawsuits related to the infringing of them, have been part of a bigger theme for a number of years in the world of technology, with companies like Apple and Samsung, and Oracle and Google, using these against each other as an analogue for their larger commercial competition.</p>
<p>While the heyday of employing those tactics appear to be mostly over, at least for the moment, patents still play a vital role as an indicator of the way that tech is developing: they point to the pace of innovation, who is taking the lead in that on a foundational basis, and what kinds of areas are driving the future of tech in a more general sense.</p>
<p>In that regard, 2020&#8217;s numbers tell us that Samsung continues to keep a very wide margin when it comes to overall number of patents. The company now has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">80,577 patents in total, up 5 percent more than in the year before. It has a very large margin still over the second-biggest patent holder. IBM currently holds 38,541 patents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To be sure, in terms of activity in the last year, IBM leads the pack still when it comes to the most patents secured in 2020, with </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">9,130 grants, although this declined 1% compared to a year ago. Samsung was granted 6,415 patents at number two, with Canon Inc., Microsoft, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, LG Electronics, Apple, Huawei Technologies, and Qualcomm making up the rest of the top-10 list.</span></p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Amazon (number 11 at 2,244 patents), Google (17 with 1,817 patents) and Facebook (38 with 938 patents) all also made the top 50 patent recipients this year.</p>
<h2>Technology trends</h2>
<p>While the concept of patents has a long history that predates the rise of consumer electronics, they have seen an ineluctable shift away from physical systems and hardware, and towards the services that run on these, over time. In the last year, the top two most popular technology classes patented, IFI said, were electrical digital data processing and transmission of digital information &#8212; the generic names that underpin software and and how information and data are stored and processed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, IFI found that &#8220;computer systems based on biological models&#8221; was the fastest-growing technology on the list, up 67% last year compared to its growth between 2016 and 2020. The category points to the ongoing and huge interest in artificial intelligence, where areas like neural networking and other tech processes based on the mechanics of the human brain continue to be in hot demand, with Google, Microsoft and Intel all major patent winners in the area, IFI said. Alongside that aspect of AI, it said that machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous technology and 3D printing also saw big increases.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, last year medical and biological technologies figured very strongly, with areas like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hybrid plant creation topping the list of trending technology, and CRISPR gene-editing and cancer therapies also figuring strongly. It&#8217;s interesting that in a year with a global health pandemic, and unprecedented medical research taking place in the race to find remedies and vaccines, we have seen little of that play out in patents granted, although I&#8217;m guessing the results would be different if considering what is being filed. It will be worth watching how this plays out in coming years, along with other trends that made themselves very prominent in the last year, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the regulatory and public perception setbacks faced by companies like Juul, electrical smoking devices still saw an increase of 55% in terms of patents filed last year. This indicates that there is still going to be a lot of development in the area as traditional smoking continues to be scrutinised and decline, but clearly the addiction does not.</p>
