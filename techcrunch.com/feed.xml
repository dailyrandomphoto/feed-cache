										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch events always offer a compelling mix of main stage presentations and smaller, breakout sessions that allow more time for lots of questions and deeper discussions. Expect nothing less at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27.</p>
<p>We want to highlight the sponsored sessions we have on tap for you. Remember, TechCrunch sponsors don’t just cut a check and call it a day. They show up ready to inform, enlighten and take questions in their area of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>A quick reminder from the home office:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> right here. Prices go up at the virtual door.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before we tell you about the specific sessions, consider this feedback we received from Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax.</p>
<p>“There was always something interesting going on in one of the breakout sessions, and I was impressed by the quality of the people participating. Partners in well-known VC firms spoke, they were accessible, and they shared smart, insightful nuggets. You will not find this level of people accessible and in one place anywhere else.”</p>
<p>And now, a word from our sponsors. You’ll find the exact times (and more presentations) listed in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities:</strong> As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO Co-founder and CEO, Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities. Presented by KUDO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack Founder and CEO, Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like. Presented by RudderStack.</p>
<p><strong>How do High-growth Companies use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?</strong> Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl prohibits growth?</strong> SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100 percent. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS Management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. Presented by LeanIX.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale:</strong> As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries. Presented by AKASA.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving a satellite’s thruster power and maneuverability can play a vital role in space sustainability. How? Developing and testing new technologies — like electronic propulsion systems (EPS) — can ultimately help better smallsats achieve their correct orbit, avoid collisions with space junk and then de-orbit safely when they become non-operational.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPS and other new technologies can be used in smaller spacecraft without decreasing their capability to perform tasks like maintaining camera imaging, communications and other mission-critical projects.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s on the thruster horizon? You’ll have ample opportunity to learn about the latest up-and-coming advancements happening in in-space propulsion technologies at the virtual edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space this December 14-15</a>. Case in point:</span><a href="https://accion-systems.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — developer of ion propulsion systems for satellites — will be in the virtual house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to redefine the performance, efficiency and scalability of spacecraft propulsion systems to expand what’s possible in space. Or, as Natalya Bailey, the company’s co-founder &amp; CTO said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make space more affordable and accessible by changing what spacecraft can do in and beyond Earth’s orbit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propulsion systems don’t just power space flight; they power possibility and opportunity. Take advantage of your opportunity to learn more about this topic alongside, lunar sampling, orbit servicing and the commercialization of space from barrier-breaking companies at TC Sessions: Space 2021.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/">SkyCell</a>, a Swiss company developing smart containers for transporting medicines and vaccines, is announcing a significant round of funding. On top of a $62 million round that closed last year, the company has now raised a $35 million Series C to improve shipping of temperature-sensitive drugs – including COVID-19 vaccines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which is a combination of equity and debt financing, lists investors from the Middle East, including DisruptAD and (the VC arm of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund), and SHUAA (a major UAE asset management and investment banking firm). The investment also includes, per the company, “China-based” and Zurich-based family offices,” and investment from Mobiliar, a major private Swiss insurance company. </span></p>
<p>This round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $133 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, SkyCell has developed a shipping container that maintains temperature, controls vibration, and is outfitted with sensors that continuously report the status of the cargo. The idea is to minimize temperature excursions – harmful fluctuations that can spoil drug products – and other damage that happens during shipping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An oft-cited number in the vaccine logistics community comes from a </span><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/68463/WHO_VB_03.18.Rev.1_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2005 World Health Organization report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting that as many as 50 percent of vaccines are wasted – partially thanks to temperature, logistics, and shipping issues. The biopharma industry uses more optimistic numbers. SkyCell co-founder and CEO Richard Ettl says the industry typically factors in about a 4% failure rate for established markets and 12% failure rate for emerging markets when it ships drugs around the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, SkyCell’s temperature excursion rate is less than .1%, according to an </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/new-audit-reaffirms-skycells-high-performance-efficiency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outside audit of the technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/skycell-raises-62m-for-smart-containers-and-analytics-to-transport-pharmaceuticals/">last covered</a> SkyCell back in April 2020, the company had been working with eight major pharmaceutical companies and was in trials with seven more. The company now “works with the majority of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies,” per a PR representative – though the company wouldn’t provide further details. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before COVID-19, the company was delivering about 250 million vials of pharmaceutical products per year across all customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the technology has moved forward in one big way: It’s been redesigned to be able to transport mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the raw materials needed to make them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly designed containers use dry ice – a necessity to achieve the temperatures about -80 to -60 degrees Celsius preferred (but </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-allows-more-flexible-storage-transportation-conditions-pfizer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no longer always required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to transport vaccines like Pfizer’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to ultra-cold vaccine shipping, dry ice is basically unavoidable. (UPS Healthcare makes its own dry ice and has been <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/ups-dry-ice-pfizer-vaccine-coronavirus-stirling-ultracold/589723/">upping production</a> to meet COVID-19 vaccine demand ). SkyCell’s tech, says Ettl, uses far less of it than competitors. It uses </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/skycell-introduces-revolutionary-new-deep-frozen-container-the-1500df/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 kilograms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of dry ice for about 120 hours of use, though it can store vaccines longer, if more dry ice is added upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The competition would need 200 kilos or more of dry ice,” he says. “So that was a major feat of engineering.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says the company is now transporting either raw materials or vaccines for three top COVID-19 vaccine makers (he did not disclose which ones – though by the ultra cold temperature requirements, you might be able to guess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two [of the three] we almost exclusively transport the raw material that comes out of the factory,” he says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major step forward is the company’s expansion from flying into trucking services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many vaccines first arrive in countries via plane, it’s often trucks that bring vaccines to central medical warehouses. Ideally these trucks are refrigerated, but those aren’t always available, which means that cold boxes and large-scale hauler trucks get used instead, according to a</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/port-to-patient-improving-country-cold-chains-for-covid-19-vaccines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2021 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion into trucking greatly increases the reach of SkyCell’s vaccine distribution network. The company has been involved in European distribution of vaccines for one major vaccine player, Ettl says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before we were not doing trucking,” says Ettl. “Our container is used on trucks to transport these -80 Celsius and very cold temperature [products] around. So this was definitely a big change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says that COVID-19 vaccine shipping will likely continue to play a role in the company’s future. But it’s not the core of their business. Many pharmaceutical products from cancer drugs to other vaccines require cold chain handling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Air Transport Association’s Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics </span><a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/494bc14afd934b0193735e9a47091d72/iata_ceiv-pharma_how20to20become20ceiv20pharma20certified.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">world sales of cold-chain drugs and biologics will surpass $440 billion by 2024 – and that doesn’t include COVID-19 vaccine spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that industry, there also appear to be three macro-trends, the report continues. There are an increasing number of container reuse services, and development of more recyclable shipping containers, and finally the use of electronics to track shipments in real time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part SkyCell overlaps with all of these trends. The fact that SkyCell’s container is reusable is a “major driver” that has helped the company obtain pharmaceutical partnerships, Ettl says. The company has also installed sensors within the boxes, and collects a constellation of data points on every shipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl believes that SkyCell is poised to respond to industry-level changes and increasing demand for cold-chain products. So far, the numbers seem to be in the company’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have never lost the product in the company&#8217;s history,” he says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As last week came to a close, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001625278/000162828021019876/nerdwallets-1.htm">NerdWallet filed to go public</a>. Given the late hour, our S-1 dive had to wait until today.</p>
<p>The NerdWallet IPO comes at an interesting time. The company provides financial product recommendations to both consumers and SMBs, meaning that it dabbles in the same market that fintech startups play in. And because NerdWallet is essentially a weaponized content play, we get to talk about the value of the written word.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>NerdWallet is pursuing a traditional IPO, meaning that it will raise primary capital in its public debut. Per its filing, the company intends to &#8220;use approximately $29.0 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay all outstanding principal amounts and accrued interest under certain promissory notes.&#8221; The rest will go to running and growing the company, or what lawyers like to call &#8220;general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The NerdWallet IPO is a liquidity event for several investing groups, including Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which owns 17.5% of Class A stock ahead of the company&#8217;s public offering, RRE Ventures (6.5% of pre-IPO shares), and iGlobe Partners (6.0%). (Crunchbase has more regarding the company&#8217;s private fundraising history <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nerdwallet/company_financials">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We want to know how COVID-19 impacted NerdWallet&#8217;s growth, how quickly it is expanding revenues in 2021, its historical profitability and recent trends thereof, and how the company manages to stay trustworthy, a question that we&#8217;ll address through the lens of editorial independence. Sound good? Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 and NerdWallet</h2>
<p>The pandemic was not kind to NerdWallet, but because the firm had variable costs it could constrain, wasn&#8217;t disastrous to its overall business.</p>
<p>NerdWallet generated $228.3 million in revenues in 2019, a figure that rose only modestly to $245.3 million in 2020. For a venture-backed company, posting growth of around 7.5% can be lethal. At that pace of growth, who&#8217;d want to back a startup?</p>
<p>More recently, growth has sped back up, with NerdWallet posting $137.3 million in H1 2020 revenues, a figure that expanded to $181.6 in the first half of 2021. The latter figure represents growth of just over 32%, a much healthier number than what the company recorded in 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic is partially to blame for NerdWallet&#8217;s slack 2020 growth. Here&#8217;s the company discussing what COVID-19 did to certain lines of its business:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is expanding its investment in audio initiatives with the launch of a new &#8220;Audio&#8221; destination in its mobile app in the U.S., where users will be able to discover in one place all the audio formats Facebook now hosts, including podcasts, Live Audio Rooms and short-form audio. The company says it&#8217;s also making its Clubhouse rival, Live Audio Rooms, more broadly available to global users, and is beginning to roll out a new product called Soundbites, a sort of TikTok for audio offering short audio clips.</p>
<p>An early version of the new Audio destination has been in the process of rolling out to all Facebook users (18 and up) in the U.S. across both iOS and Android, but is being officially announced now. It can be accessed through the top navigation within Watch, Facebook&#8217;s video hub &#8212; a design choice that feels a little incongruous, given that audio content is meant to be listened to, not &#8220;watched.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says the new destination will help creators to have their shows found, while Facebook users will be able to find audio content from favorite creators, discover new ones and access content they had saved for later. At launch, the Audio section will feature the content from the creators you&#8217;re already following, and will include a set of personalized recommendations as well as suggestions of other audio that&#8217;s popular across Facebook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The destination will become more personalized to your own tastes and interests over time, as you engage with the audio content and follow more creators, Facebook notes.</p>
<p>Timed with this launch, Facebook offered an update on the work it&#8217;s been doing to expand access to more of its audio products.</p>
<p>This spring, Facebook had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">introduced</a> a suite of new audio features, including its Clubhouse competitor called Live Audio Rooms, as well as the short-form audio product called Soundbites, plus support for podcasts. With Spotify, it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">partnered on a new miniplayer</a> that streams from the music service to users on Facebook.</p>
<p>Live Audio Rooms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">officially launched</a> in June to U.S. public figures in good standing with Facebook and to select Facebook Groups. Since then, Facebook said the feature has been found to work as a lightweight means of connection and conversation across communities, where it&#8217;s been adopted by creators including Lil Huddy, Noah and Miley Cyrus, quarterback Russell Wilson, singer Becky G, comedian Sherry Cola, Mereba Music and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2167905" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167905" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167905" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Now, Facebook says Live Audio Rooms are rolling out to more public figures and creators outside the U.S. as well as non-U.S.-based Facebook Groups. In addition to iOS, the feature has launched on Android, and the ability to listen to Live Audio has arrived on desktop, which makes it more accessible as it expands to other markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the short-form Soundbites product has been in testing since June with a group of emerging creators and others, including comedian and best-selling author Josh Sundquist; actress, disability advocate and lifestyle influencer Lolo Spencer; and digital creator Molly Burke. This test recently expanded to include more creators, and now, Facebook says Soundbites will roll out to more people in the U.S. in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The company also noted it&#8217;s been working on support for podcasts following its audio announcements earlier this year. This summer, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">made podcasts available to U.S. users</a>. More recently, it&#8217;s rolled out the ability to share short podcast clips in News Feed and added support captions on Android (with iOS still to come). Podcasters were additionally given the ability to add their RSS feeds to their Facebook Page on desktop and mobile. However, podcast listening remains still U.S.-only for the time being.</p>
<p>Facebook says as it&#8217;s been expanding its audio experiences, it&#8217;s been working on tools that would help to identify and act upon content that violates its Community Standards. This includes tools to automatically identify harmful content on Facebook. Plus, Facebook says it&#8217;s adapting both its technology and processes to detect and moderate violating audio content, as it learns more.</p>
<p>This new follows a tough week for Facebook, which not only included one of its longest outages to date, but also saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">whistleblower</a> testifying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">before the U.S. Senate</a> about the harms enabled by Facebook&#8217;s platform, including its engagement-based algorithms, inability to fight misinformation and corporate decision making that put profits above people. Facebook&#8217;s staff are now divided over the whistleblower&#8217;s testimony, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/technology/facebook-whistleblower-employees.html">The New York Times reported</a>. With Facebook now venturing deeper into audio and live audio &#8212; a difficult area to address from a moderation standpoint &#8212; Facebook could become a platform for more misinformation to spread if it&#8217;s not able to develop the necessary technology that would make audio a safe environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge declared last month that Apple was not a monopoly when issuing the court&#8217;s decision on California’s Epic Games v. Apple case. But the one area where Apple lost ground was in what sort of rules it can make for its own App Store. On this point, the judge sided with Epic Games, saying that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">Apple can no longer prohibit developers</a> from pointing to other means of payment beyond Apple&#8217;s own payment systems. Now, Apple is appealing that decision and asking for a stay on the injunction the judge had put into place. The move could delay any sort of changes to the App Store&#8217;s rules until a final decision was made after the appeals case had been decided.</p>
<p>Apple had been ordered to update its App Store policies to stop prohibiting developers from including external links and other calls to action inside their apps that could direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to in-app purchasing. Apple could also not stop developers from communicating with customers through points of contact they obtained voluntarily from customers through their app&#8217;s registration, the injunction said.</p>
<p>This is in line with other settlements Apple has recently made both inside and outside the U.S., including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">one with a Japanese regulator</a> which changed its policy for &#8220;reader apps,&#8221; allowing them to add a link to their website inside their apps. South Korea also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed a bill</a> that will prevent Apple and Google from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">a recent class-action settlement</a> with developers in the U.S., Apple clarified that developers could use communications, like emails, to share information about alternative payment methods with their iOS customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the Epic Games ruling, however, Apple was required to put into place the new rules within 90 days of the court&#8217;s decision on September 10, 2021. Some in the market were already moving forward to capitalize on that potential change. For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> somewhat prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple&#8217;s own as soon as the injunction went into effect.</p>
<p>If Apple wins the stay, the early December deadline to comply with the injunction will be discarded as the appeals case is argued in court. That means there could be no changes for App Store developers for many months to come.</p>
<p>Apple won nearly every point in the Epic Games battle except for this one minor point related to its &#8220;anti-steering&#8221; rules. But Apple was going to be forced to return to court anyway, due to Epic&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p>Despite winning the ability to add links to alternative payment methods, Epic Games was unsatisfied with the court&#8217;s original decision which declared that Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221; It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">had filed an appeal</a> of its own back in mid-September, with the hope of convincing the appeals court that Apple was acting as a monopolist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The battle between the two tech giants continues to wage outside the courtroom, as well. Last week, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney pointed, via a post on Twitter, how Apple was using its platform to market its own apps to customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-calls-out-apple-for-promoting-its-services-in-the-iphone-settings-screen/">within the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen</a> &#8212; effectively an ad slot that third-party competitors didn&#8217;t have access to, he said. The company declined to say if it would bring up this point in a later trial, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p dir="ltr">Fraud continues to be a major issue in the world of digital transactions, a situation that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/enterprise-solutions-real-cost-online-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> was only compounded in the last 20 months of online activity growing as a result of Covid-19. Today, a Melboune startup called FrankieOne that has built an automated platform to help combat that is announcing a Series A on the back of strong customer demand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company &#8212; which harnesses some 350 data sources to verify automatically people&#8217;s identities when onboarding, and then monitor subsequent activity for fraudulent behavior &#8212; has raised $16 million (Aus$20 million). It plans to use the money to grow its footprint internationally after seeing strong demand in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FrankieOne has picked up some 80 customers in the last 18 months, bringing its total to 90, including the likes of Afterpay, Westpac, and Zipmex. It also saw its annual recurring revenue grow 20-fold in the last year, with half of those sales coming from outside of its home country (but it isn&#8217;t disclosing actual revenue numbers). Notably, FrankieOne has gotten to this point with no marketing or sales team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">That traction has also caught the attention of some high-profile investors. Australia&#8217;s AirTree Ventures and Greycroft, from the U.S., co-led the round, with 20VC, Reinventure, Tidal Ventures, APEX Capital, and Mantis (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/the-chainsmokers-just-closed-their-debut-venture-fund-mantis-with-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VC fund started</a> by music act The Chainsmokers) also participating. Individuals in this Series A include Robinhood founder and CEO Vlad Tenev, Monzo founder Tom Blomfield, and senior executives from Revolut and Public.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The challenge that FrankieOne has identified is one that it identified through its own, firsthand experience as a startup. Simon Costello and Aaron Chipper co-founded the startup, which was originally called Frankie, in 2017 as a neobank hoping to ride the wave of disruptive fintechs out of Europe that were giving banks a run for their money in winning over younger consumers with more user-friendly, mobile-first options for saving, investing, managing, borrowing and spending money. That may have been ahead of its time for the Australian market, but in the process they also discovered one of the big growing pains for getting a business like that off the ground. There was no efficient way to screen and board new users, and subsequently make sure they were transacting on their platforms in a legal way.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Our journey to building a neobank revealed there a single connection for onboarding simply didn’t exist,&#8221; said Costello in an emailed interview.</p>
<p>That became the focus of the company&#8217;s pivot (and Costello said that Frankie gave back all the money it took from investors in that first effort).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We decided to scratch our own itch and built it ourselves. We knew we had found a market niche when this platform also met the needs of our peers. As we pivoted, we quickly found that our first customers were all Australian NeoBanks such as Volt Bank,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;This experience allowed us to understand banking from the inside out, and realise that for existing financial institutions, as well as emerging fintech, regulatory compliance is the single biggest challenge these companies face.&#8221;</p>
<p>The year was 2019, and the timing turned out to be fortuitous. The pandemic has led to an explosion in the amount and breadth of online transactions. And whether that activity was via financial services or e-commerce or something else, more people and organizations doing business online has meant more fragmentation, more transactions, and mainly more money for fraudsters to target.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, this is not an untapped area of financial technology. There are a number of companies in the market today building &#8220;fraud prevention as a service&#8221; and providing it to those companies that need it to run their own businesses. The list includes Alloy (which in September was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/alloy-raises-100m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-help-banks-and-fintechs-fight-fraud-with-its-api-based-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1.35 billion</a> in its latest funding round), idwall (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/brazils-idwall-raises-38m-for-identity-validation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $38 million</a>), Rapyd (a multipurpoxse financial services toolkit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $8.75 billion</a>), Stripe (the payments giant that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has made a big move</a> into onboarding, identity and fraud management), and many others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Costello points out that among FrankieOne&#8217;s unique selling points is its particularly international profile, with data-sources offered currently into 46 different countries, which he noted &#8220;speaks to the global nature of this platform, and its inherent potential to scale.&#8221; In contrast, he added that other providers of know-your-customer and anti-money laundering services that tend to be region-specific. &#8220;Very few, if any, have the capacity to service multinational enterprises that require a nuanced approach to regulation, compliance, and digital identity based on the specific requirement of that geography.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Helping with this is that, while Frankie the startup (like other neobanks) might have relied heavily on APIs from third parties to power the services it provided to customers, FrankieOne sits onthe other side of that relationship. It has built its own technology stack, Costello said, &#8220;much of which was informed by the compliance and regulatory sophistication required to operate a bank.&#8221; It also does integrate APIs directly into FrankieOne &#8212; the data sources, for example, that power its fraud management and identity verification system, which will also grow in number as FrankieOne continues to expand. It is, for example, going to be offering transaction monitoring for both fiat and cryptocurrencies later this year, and the fact that it&#8217;s already providing services to customers like Zipmex gives it an opening into doing more around fraud prevention in the still quite wild cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know your customer (KYC) and digital identity verification are board-level issues for financial services companies,&#8221; said John Henderson, a partner at AirTree Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;The current, manual systems used by fintechs and FTSE100 companies alike are both bespoke and broken. The world needs a better solution, and we believe <span class="il">FrankieOne</span> provides it. After seeing the incredible progress and undeniable traction Simon and the team have had, we&#8217;re excited to be leading their Series A as they position themselves to be the leading identity verification and fraud risk provider.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Financial services companies pay top dollar to acquire customers,&#8221; added Will Szczerbiak, Partner at Greycroft. &#8220;Upon signup, customers undergo a series of checks—including KYC, identity verification, and anti-fraud—that can force companies to turn away potentially great customers because of reliance on inadequate systems. <span class="il">FrankieOne</span>’s APIs extracts the complexity away, allowing their clients to onboard more great customers while delivering a delightful end user experience. It is a unique approach that scales globally, and we are excited about the partnership”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.swile.co">Swile</a> has raised a $200 million Series D funding round led by SoftBank International Group. With this funding round, the startup has now reached unicorn status, meaning that Swile has a valuation of $1 billion or more. Swile provides a payment card for employee benefits, such as meal vouchers, gift cards and sustainable mobility vouchers.</p>
<p>Michel Combes, SoftBank International Group’s President (pictured left), is joining Swile’s board. Some of the startup’s existing investors are participating once again, such as Eurazeo, Index Ventures and Bpifrance. Headline is also investing in Swile for the first time.</p>
<p>This is a significant round for the company as it keeps raising bigger rounds year after year. Swile raised a Series A round of $17.4 million (€15 million) in 2018, a Series B round of $34.7 million (€30 million) in 2019 and a Series C round of $81 million (€70 million) in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Swile started as a payment card to hold your meal vouchers. In France, companies have to contribute to lunch when it’s in the middle of a work day. Some companies offer a cafeteria with cheap meals, others hand out meal vouchers that you can spend in restaurants and bakeries.</p>
<p>But the experience is a bit confusing when you’re paying for lunch. Employees often ask whether a restaurant accepts meal vouchers. And if you want to spend more than your daily budget, you have to use two cards.</p>
<p>With Swile, employees can optionally add their personal debit card to the Swile app. When you spend more than your daily limit, Swile automatically charges your personal card. It’s a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>And this product alone has been quite successful. Just four years after launch, Swile has captured a 13% market share on meal vouchers in France. It competes with well-established companies, such as Edenred, UpDéjeuner, Sodexo’s Pass Restaurant and Apetiz. Swile generates revenue on interchange fees and on commission on affiliates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to small and medium companies, the startup has managed to convince bigger clients, such as supermarket chain Carrefour and its 65,000 employees in France. Other clients include Doctolib, Spotify and Airbnb in France.</p>
<p>“Our bet with Swile — as we disclosed it 18 months ago — is that we want to go beyond lunch and manage employee benefits with the Swile card. It should help you manage all your employee benefits,” Swile founder and CEO Loïc Soubeyrand told me.</p>
<p>For instance, employee representatives usually offer gift cards for the end of the year. Instead of handing out paper checks, the employee representative bodies can top up the Swile card with those gift cards. After that, the employee can use the same card for lunch and for Christmas presents. Swile has acquired <a href="https://www.sweevana.com">Sweevana</a> for that part of the business.</p>
<p>Similarly, Swile will soon let you pay for ride-sharing, public transport subscriptions or bike rides between your home and your office. In France, this is a nascent market as companies will have to contribute to sustainable mobility spendings starting on January 1st.</p>
<p>“This is what’s great with unification. You don’t need five different cards to manage five different benefits,” Soubeyrand said. And companies don&#8217;t need five solutions with five different suppliers either.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215960" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215960" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2215960" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rosace_cards.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215960" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swile</p></div></p>
<h2>From a super card to a super app</h2>
<p>Beyond the Swile card and its transactional revenue, the startup wants to build an app to improve internal communications, run anonymous surveys and gather feedback from employees. This could open up some revenue opportunities with a software-as-a-service approach and monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>The company has been testing its app in beta for the last 12 months and it should be available to Swile clients soon. Swile has acquired Briq for its expertise on that area.</p>
<p>In the future, small companies could also imagine managing their corporate spending from Swile. You don’t necessarily need a full-fledged, separate solution to manage expenses when you’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Up next, Swile also has ambitious international goals. Brazil is by far the biggest market when it comes to employee benefits. With the acquisition of Vee Benefícios, Swile now has 120 employees in São Paulo and it wants to turn Brazil into its main market.</p>
<p>By 2022, Swile wants to hire 500 employees — the company will double in size. There will be more international expansions as well. Mexico looks like another promising market for instance. Even if those international bets take time to pay off, Swile is still just getting started in its home market. It still has a tiny market share and a lot of room for growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit announced today that it has hired Pali Bhat, the former vice-president of product and design at Google Cloud, as the company’s first Chief Product Officer. Bhat will be tasked with overseeing Reddit’s product organization and leading the development of tools and features for the platform.</p>
<p>In his new role, Bhat will report directly to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. Bhat will lead and facilitate the creation of tools and features focused on bringing &#8220;community and belonging&#8221; to Reddit, the company said.</p>
<p>Bhat brings over 15 years of expertise in leading teams and products across developer platforms and consumer services, including several Google flagship services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Prior to joining Reddit, Bhat held senior leadership roles for more than 10 years at Google where he most recently led a nearly-thousand-person team of engineers, product managers, user experience designers, and researchers across a high-growth product suite. Bhat was also previously the vice-president of product management and led Google’s payment products globally. Before Google, Bhat held leadership positions at SAP Labs and McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CRED has begun to engage with investors to raise money at a valuation of $5.5 billion as the Indian fintech startup eyes international expansion and inorganic growth, a source familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The startup has received a number of inbound requests from investors and has also held talks with some in recent days to raise capital at a pre-money valuation of $5.5 billion, the source said, just weeks after the three-year-old startup was finalizing an investment of over $200 million at a pre-money valuation of about $3.75 billion from Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital among others, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Deliberations for the new financing round are at a very early stage and the terms may change, the source said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215918" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.2 billion in an April round</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">$806 million in a round it disclosed in January</a>, disputed the claims.</p>
<p>In conversations with investors, CRED founder and chief executive Kunal Shah has said that he plans to deploy at least part of the new capital to invest in &#8212; and acquire &#8212; other fintech startups, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The startup has already engaged with several firms. It recently invested $5 million in CredAvenue, which recently unveiled a $90 million Series A funding, and is in talks to back fintech startup Uni at a valuation of over $300 million, according to three people familiar with the matter. (Shah is also one of the most prolific angel investors in India and has backed over 150 startups.)</p>
<p>CRED, which helps people improve their credit score by paying bills on time and has amassed over 7.5 million members, has this year also explored aggressively expanding its e-commerce platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On its app, the startup offers its members access to a range of premium brands. Earlier this year, CRED explored whether it should acquire some of those brands, said people familiar with the matter, who like everyone else, spoke on the condition of anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn’t focus on the usual TAM of India — hundreds of millions of users of the world’s second-most populated nation — and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>
<p>“India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in an earlier report.</p>
<p>“Very few starts-ups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,” they added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">So many startups launching credit card products. </p>
<p>All of them expanding TAM for one startup.</p>
<p>&mdash; Osborne Saldanha (@os7borne) <a href="https://twitter.com/os7borne/status/1446320144146329604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>CRED has also expressed intentions to expand outside of India to potential investors. Shah told one investor that he has identified one international market where CRED is exploring to launch its offering, another person familiar with the matter said. TechCrunch couldn’t determine the name of the market.</p>
<p>CRED — backed by Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital and Sequoia Capital India — has been aggressively expanding to new categories in recent quarters. The startup lends to its members, giving them the option to pay their rent and tution fee from the app itself.</p>
<p>In August, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/indian-fintech-cred-launches-peer-to-peer-lending-feature-mint/">launched Mint</a>, a service through which it allows its members to lend to one another at an interest rate of up to 9% annually.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Wow, there was a lot this week, which means I am omitting the &#8220;notable news and other tidbits&#8221; section this time around. One other note &#8230; I had promised a breakdown of a lengthy interview with Kodiak Robotics co-founder and CEO Don Burnette this week<em>.</em> With all the GM news and other deals, I&#8217;ve pushed to next week to allow for the space it deserves. Sorry folks!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here is one noteworthy item that might normally go in that notable news section: Tesla has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/elon-musk-announces-tesla-to-move-headquarters-to-austin/">Austin its new headquarters</a>. The news, which was announced during Tesla&#8217;s shareholder meeting Friday, comes more than a year after CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/09/elon-musk-threatens-to-pull-tesla-operations-out-of-california/">threatened to leave California</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/09/tesla-sues-alameda-county-to-force-california-factory-reopening/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Alameda County amid a battle with the state over its regulatory environment during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It seems, at least based on Musk&#8217;s comments, that the reasons for the move are more about affordable housing, the ability to expand and commuting time for workers than his clash with California health officials last year.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Texas certainly takes a less restrictive approach to business than say California. Of course, Texas still doesn&#8217;t allow direct sales in the state that Tesla has now decided to call home.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it this week, shall we?</p>
<p>Israeli shared multimodal mobility operator <strong>GoTo Global Mobility</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/goto-global-drives-european-expansion-with-acquisition-of-german-e-moped-sharing-company-emmy/">acquired German shared electric scooter company</a> <strong>emmy</strong>. They didn&#8217;t share the financial terms of the deal, but the acquisition will allow GoTo easy entry into German markets like Munich, Hamburg and Berlin. GoTo plans to bring other forms of mobility, like e-bikes and cars, to Germany by next year. The company says car-sharing is a great addition to shared micromobility because it creates a full mobility ecosystem that results in loyal customers and better unit economics.</p>
<p><strong>Tortoise</strong>, the company that&#8217;s working with <strong>Spin</strong> to remotely rebalance Spin&#8217;s three-wheeled scooters, has made a strong pivot to remotely operated delivery vehicles over the past few months. The latest is a deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tortoise-expands-remote-operated-robotic-delivery-to-convenience-stores-across-the-us/">King Retail Solutions</a> to resell and distribute over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tortoise-expands-remote-operated-robotic-delivery-to-convenience-stores-across-the-us/">500 of Tortoise&#8217;s sidewalk robots</a> to help convenience store customers achieve affordable, same-day last-mile delivery options.</p>
<p>Speaking of Spin and its three-wheeler, the company just deployed a fleet of 50 tri-scooters in Santa Monica. The S-200 gives riders better stability than a traditional 2-wheeler, according to Spin, 500 of which have also hit the streets in SM.</p>
<p>Swedish electric motorbike maker <strong>Cake</strong> has created and delivered the first batch of purpose-built electric anti-poaching bush bikes to Africa. The Kalk AP, complete with 18-inch custom off-road tires, a rear carrier to attach arms or medical equipment and a first aid kit to treat wounded animals, was delivered to rangers who will test the bikes under the R&amp;D department of the Southern African Wildlife College.</p>
<h3>E-bikes are still all the rage</h3>
<p>From July 2020 to July 2021, U.S. e-bike revenue skyrocketed 240% YOY, <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwtkc2OhSAMhZ_mstMI4t-CxWzmNQy2vcpcBIN1HN9-cO4kpIcmp-XkAyzTHNNltrizuMvI10Ym0Ll7YqYkjp3S6NCooa50o7RAo1H2TS_cPj4T0WqdN5wOEtsxeQeWXQz3RNu3nVgMdgNWGrXsKtkNSsquxb6SDdmJnoD2_aw90FEAMvRN6YqBhDcL87Y_6o-H-sznPM8ybFhCXHN3J8wy-ThnUZWSWXihAi7wLszFatOLuNgIrd8Lu5DFwoXi3ymcuW-yqhrZSSXrUpWon6qBjkAjtLWSJX9p_pEv_9DVOqtyP6adLbzuBCKZRBMB2JIJFkhHgCX75pvGnyHDGLOuR3B8jRTs5AnfnPiN-4_cOFOglL8BR8tGtnWtm3qo-yxvMBmklpl9qweRE2DMU8GsDlJc4-R83v4LKjGYRg">according to <strong>NDP Group</strong></a>. Other cycling equipment only increased 15% in the same time frame. E-bikes are now the third largest cycling category in terms of sales rev.</p>
<p>Which makes this the perfect time for <strong>Radio Flyer</strong> to launch its first line of electric bikes and scooters, which are now<a href="https://flyer.radioflyer.com/"> available for preorder</a> and should officially arrive later this month. Flyer products were designed with adults and their many needs in mind, so there are plenty of attachments like child seats and cargo carriers. The bikes start at $1,699.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Brazil, micromobility tech provider <strong>Tembici</strong> has just <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/tembici-raises-80-million-to-expand-electric-bicycles/">raised $80 million</a> in a Series C. It will use the money to expand its fleet and its footprint into new cities, as well as accelerate its new business line focused on e-bike delivery.</p>
<p>Even <strong>Volkswagen</strong> gets it. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/herbertdiess_radfahren-macht-spa%C3%9F-ist-gesund-und-gut-activity-6851420998118461441-cy4M/">Employees at VW&#8217;s Wolfsburg plant</a> will now get to pilot a new network of cycle paths around the plant and to the factory gates and parking lots. Employees who live in the factory environment have been campaigning to come to work by bike instead of car for years, so it&#8217;s nice to see VW take action. The company hopes to be able to expand the pilot project in the future.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Another day, another transportation IPO announcement. This time, it is Swedish carmaker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China&#8217;s Zhejiang Geely Holding. Volvo Cars said it would<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/geelys-volvo-cars-will-file-for-initial-public-offering-on-stockholms-nasdaq/"> file for an initial public offering</a> and list on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, in a transaction that&#8217;s expected to raise up to $2.9 billion (25 billion Swedish kroner).</p>
<p>The IPO is interesting on its own. But what I find so intriguing is that just the week before, Volvo Cars&#8217; electric performance spinoff Polestar announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">own plans to go public</a> via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. It seems likely that the timing is not a coincidence; according to WSJ reporting, the Polestar SPAC assigned a value of around $10 billion to Volvo&#8217;s stake in the company, paving the way for Volvo&#8217;s IPO.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arbe Robotics</strong>, a radar startup that merged with a special purpose acquisition company, made its public debut October 8 on the Nasdaq exchange. The company is trading under the &#8220;ARBE&#8221; ticker symbol. On the first day of trading, Arbe shares opened at $7.95 and closed at $8.10.</p>
<p><strong>Northvolt</strong> is investing $750 million to expand off of Northvolt Labs, its existing cell industrialization plant in Sweden. The plan is to build adjacent testing facilities and a pilot recycling plant, which will feed recycled raw materials directly into on-site production. The company wants the campus, which will eventually employ 1,000 people, to become a leading center for battery technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Otto</strong>, a Dallas-based fintech startup that wants to allow people to use their vehicle&#8217;s equity for access to credit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/mark-cuban-backed-otto-raises-4-5m-to-turn-car-equity-into-credit/">raised $4.5 million</a> in a seed round of funding led by Uncommon Capital and included participation from Pelion Venture Partners, 1930 Capital, Bloom VP and Spacecadet Ventures. Other investors include Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor; Leo Polovets, co-founder and general partner at Susa Ventures; Bill Clerico, co-founder and CEO of WePay; and Vivek Garipalli, co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Otto&#8217;s mobile platform is set to launch in early 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Ouster</strong>, a lidar company that went public this year via a SPAC merger, agreed to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/lidar-developer-ouster-agrees-to-buy-sense-photonics-as-it-takes-aim-at-the-auto-industry/">solid-state lidar startup Sense Photonics</a> in an all-stock deal valued at around $68 million. Ouster said it will establish a new business arm, Ouster Automotive, which will be headed by Sense CEO Shauna McIntyre. That business will integrate Sense&#8217;s 200-meter range solid-state lidar into a new lidar suite. San Francisco-based Sense&#8217;s claim to fame is also its improved field of view, as TechCrunch&#8217;s Devin Coldewey has previously explained.</p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm</strong> scored the purchase of Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer, nudging out Magna International with a higher bid. Qualcomm and investment group SSW Partners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/">will acquire Veoneer for $37 per share</a> in an all-cash transaction. At closing, SSW said it would sell Veoneer&#8217;s Arriver tech &#8212; an advanced driver assistance system stack that includes sensors and software &#8212; to Qualcomm and retain the Swedish company&#8217;s other Tier 1 supplier businesses. Veoneer had previously agreed to sell itself to Magna.</p>
<p><strong>Rendered.ai</strong>, a two-year-old data startup that is generating synthetic data for the satellite, medical, robotics and automotive industries, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/rendered-ai-raises-6m-to-scale-physics-based-synthetic-data-developer-platform/">$6 million seed round</a> led by Space Capital, with participation from Tectonic Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Union Labs and Uncorrelated Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Tekion</strong>, the end-to-end automotive SaaS platform startup launched by Tesla&#8217;s former CIO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tekion-the-automotive-retail-platform-headed-by-a-former-tesla-cio-just-tripled-in-value/">raised $250 million</a> in a Series D financing round co-led by Alkeon Capital and Durable Capital. Other investors include Hyundai Motor Company, several dealer groups across the U.S., and earlier backers Advent International, Index Ventures and FM Capital. The round has pushed the company&#8217;s valuation from $1 billion to $3.5 billion. It has raised a total of 435 million.</p>
<p><strong>Tenstreet</strong>, a truck driver recruiting software company, is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211004005450/en/Tenstreet-Announces-Majority-Growth-Investment-From-Providence-Equity-Partners">now majority owned</a> by private equity firm Providence Equity Partners. Existing investor Spectrum Equity and Tenstreet Co-founder and CEO Tim Crawford will maintain their minority stakes.</p>
<p><strong>TruckLabs</strong>, a Stanford spin-out that has developed hardware and software to reduce fuel consumption in long-haul trucks, raised a $15 million Series A round co-led by returning investors Calibrate Ventures, Autotech Ventures, and Uncork Capital. To date, TruckLabs has raised $24 million.</p>
<p><strong>Volcon</strong>, an all-electric off-road powersports company, closed its initial public offering of 3,025,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.50. The gross proceeds of the offering were $16.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts,<br />
commissions and offering expenses. The company is trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol &#8220;VLCN.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong> Voom</strong>, the commercial drone insurer, has raised $15 million to expand its usage-based insurance model to motorcycles, light aircraft, ride-hailing and delivery drivers. The funding round was co-led by JAL Ventures and UP.Partners, with participation from F2 Capital, Arbor Ventures, Verizon Ventures and ICON Continuity Fund. The company, which launched a pay-per-mile insurance product for motorcycles in August, has raised a total of $22 million.</p>
<p><strong>Zaver</strong>, a Swedish fintech startup that built a platform that lets merchants accept cardless payments and offer buy-now-pay-later as an option, raised<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> $13 million in a Series A round. </span></p>
<p><strong>ZF</strong> signed a strategic partnership agreement with autonomous vehicle software company Oxbotica to develop a Level 4 self-driving system that will initially be deployed in passenger shuttles in major cities around the world, the companies said.</p>
<p><strong>Zūm</strong>, a startup that provides optimized transportation services for school-age children, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/student-transportation-startup-zum-to-add-10000-evs-to-its-platform/">raised $130 million</a> in a Series D round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 with participation from existing investors including Sequoia, BMW i Ventures and AngelPad. The company intends to use the funds to add 10,000 new electric buses, vans and cars to its platform with the end goal of achieving 100% EVs by 2025.

<p>The jumping off point for this week&#8217;s column comes from <strong>Cruise CEO Dan Amman</strong>, who gave a presentation Wednesday at <strong>General Motors&#8217;</strong> two-day investor event. There was sweeping series of briefings from the automaker — news that&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">worth catching up on</a> further down in this newsletter — but not what I want to talk about here.</p>
<p>Instead, I want to focus on what Amman said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cruise-plans-to-have-tens-of-thousands-of-origin-avs-on-roads-in-coming-years/">regarding commercializing Cruise</a>: &#8220;Over the next 12 to 24 months, you will be able to push a button and get a ride with a very short ETA in a couple of major cities in the United States,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;If you look at the next three to four years, we will be deployed in multiple cities, multiple markets around the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m curious about is&#8230; how many people would actually get in an autonomous vehicle? Not just today, but a year from now, or five? The answer to this question is, predictably, a complicated one. Let&#8217;s look at two recent polls from the market research firm <strong>Morning Consult</strong>. The first polled 2,200 people <a href="http://progresschamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Morning-Consult-AV-survey.pdf">at the end of August</a>; the second, the same number at the <a href="http://progresschamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Morning-Consult-AV-survey.pdf">beginning of September</a>.</p>
<p>The second poll found that only 25% of people surveyed would be ready to get in an AV this year or next; but that number jumps to 53% when the timespan is extended to the next five years. Only 27% of people said they would &#8220;never be ready&#8221; to ride in an AV. This is in line with the first poll, which saw slightly improved attitudes regarding AVs.</p>
<p>Morning Consult also asked people whether they had heard of the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration&#8217;s probe into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot &#8212; a little annoying, because Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system, but I understand why they did it: the public doesn&#8217;t have much of an understanding of the difference, and Tesla&#8217;s CEO Elon Musk does little to help the matters by naming the upgraded version of Autopilot &#8220;Full Self Driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news, for AV developers at least, is that public opinion is getting higher over time. Based on a roundup of <a href="https://saferoads.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Public-Opinion-Polls-7-22-19.pdf">public opinion poll results</a> from Advocates for Highway Safety, there appears to be a slight trend over time of people moving from the &#8216;Never&#8217; camp to the &#8216;Maybe&#8217; camp, when asked whether they would ever ride in an AV.</p>
<p>The biggest drivers for this shift in public support, also according to polls, seems to be greater education in AV technology, visibility and government regulation. A poll conducted by <strong>Partners for Automated Vehicle Education</strong> found that <a href="https://pavecampaign.org/pave-poll-americans-wary-of-avs-but-say-education-and-experience-with-technology-can-build-trust/">more than half of respondents</a> would trust AVs more if they had to receive government approval similar to a driver&#8217;s license for humans.</p>
<p>Humans are leery of robots for a whole host of reasons, some more rational than others, but what this suggests to me is that the race to autonomous vehicles will be more tortoise than hare: slow and steady wins the race.</p>

<p>As Aria mentioned above<strong>, General Motors</strong> held its two-day investor event, in which a slew of announcements and forecasting took place. The bottom line: GM plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">double its revenue</a> by the end of the decade and take over EV market share from Tesla, even as it increases profit margins for its ICE vehicles. In total, that looks like $280 billion in annual revenues by 2030.</p>
<p>The upshot: GM talked a lot about selling software-based services and subscriptions, as well as a range of &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-takes-aim-at-teslas-market-share-with-growing-portfolio-of-evs/">really affordable EVs for the people</a>,&#8221; like the Chevy Silverado pickup. GM CEO <strong>Mary Barra </strong>said GM hopes to attract would-be Tesla customers with good prices, customer loyalty, strong manufacturing capacity and a wide dealership network.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a complete breakdown of announcements:</p>
<h3>Supply chain strategies</h3>
<p>After all the drama with semiconductor shortages and spontaneously combusting batteries causing factory delays, abysmal Q3 sales and car recalls, GM will need a good logistics strategy to kick this off.</p>
<p>The company signed a memorandum of understanding with <strong>General Electric</strong> for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-general-electric-agree-to-develop-rare-earth-materials-used-in-ev-manufacturing/">supply of rare earth materials</a> needed to manufacture EVs and clean energy equipment. The agreement is non-binding and will also explore ways to improve supplies of magnets, copper and &#8220;eSteel,&#8221; a material composed in part of recycled materials. This move is en vogue among automakers looking to control the supply, and GM stands to lose a lot from being at the mercy of an unpredictable supply chain.</p>
<h3>More money for charging</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t have a bunch of EVs hit the market with nowhere to charge them, so GM also announced an investment of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-is-upping-its-investment-in-charging-infrastructure-to-increase-confidence-in-evs/"> nearly $750 million</a> through 2025 to create more access to public, home and work EV chargers. The automaker didn&#8217;t provide specifics on exactly where that capital would go. Will it go towards building out its own infrastructure or put towards partnerships? Maybe the latter. Last year, GM announced a partnership with <strong>EVgo</strong>, a charging network company, to install more than 2,700 DC fast chargers over five years.</p>
<h3>New ADAS tech</h3>
<p>GM is also launching a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-to-introduce-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-system-in-2023-starting-with-cadillac/">hands-free advanced driver assistance system</a> in 2023 called Ultra Cruise, that it says will work in 95% of all driving scenarios. Ultra Cruise will first be released in the Cadillac models and then in other GM brands like GMC and Chevrolet. GM did not stipulate whether the new system will sell for a flat fee or as a subscription. But based on executives comments about subscriptions, we&#8217;re expecting this too will be a pay-for-access feature.</p>
<h3>Subscriptions = revenue</h3>
<p>GM said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-aims-to-build-netflix-sized-subscription-business-by-2030/">expects in-car subscriptions</a> to put it in league with Netflix and Spotify in terms of revenue by 2030. GM expects in-car subscriptions like OnStar and Maps+ to generate nearly $2 billion in revenue this year, which it says could reach as high as $25 billion over the next decade. The company is beefing up subscriptions offerings, particularly to commercial fleets that might be interested in logistics and analytics services. The launch of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/">Ultifi software platform</a> in 2023 should help boost subscriptions.</p>
<h3>Commercialize AVs</h3>
<p>Finally, GM&#8217;s autonomous driving subsidiary, <strong>Cruise</strong>, said it expects to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cruise-plans-to-have-tens-of-thousands-of-origin-avs-on-roads-in-coming-years/">&#8220;tens of thousands&#8221;</a> of its purpose-built Origin AVs on U.S. roads over the next few years, even though production won&#8217;t start on the Origin until 2023.</p>
<p>The company, which is but a permit away from being able to launch a commercial driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco, is counting on technological advancements, a $5 billion line of credit from GM Financial and a human-less business model to help it scale rapidly and profitably across self-driving ride-hail and delivery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s not discuss the Mustang Mach-E&#8217;s name. Not the Mach-E portion, the other part. The lineage of the pony car slapped onto an electric SUV. Those arguments are over. People have picked sides. The question of whether or not the Mach-E is a Mustang is irrelevant. A far more pressing query is upon us: Is the Mach-E GT worthy of the GT badge?</p>
<p>Without reservation, both the Mach-E GT (Starting at $59,900) and Mach-E GT Performance Edition (starting at $64,900) are worthy of Ford&#8217;s Grand Touring badging. This is accomplished thanks to significant power boosts on both trim levels versus the regular Mach-E, a new track mode, and in the case of the Performance Edition, an upgraded suspension system.</p>
<h2>Unbridled</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2215872" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215872" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215872 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg" alt="Ford Mustang Mach E GT back end" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2215872" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The base-level Mach-E is already quick thanks to its EV powertrain. For the GT and GT Performance Edition, the acceleration and throttle response have been increased to deliver impressive bursts of speed. The GT ships with 480 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and hits 60 miles-per-hour from a dead stop in 3.8 seconds. To increase speed, Ford upgraded the front motor and while the battery pack is the same at 88-kWh, the wiring and tuning of the pack has been enhanced.</p>
<p>For those with larger budgets and a desire to hit 60 even quicker, the GT Performance Edition sports 480 horsepower and 634 pound-feet of torque for a zero to 60 run of 3.5 seconds. Like the GT it&#8217;s also received a battery wiring and tuning upgrade and an enhanced front motor.</p>
<p>Both vehicles ship with all-wheel-drive (AWD) standard which helps deliver all the EV torque to the road but that power isn&#8217;t as well maintained as it should be. During multiple launches, the front wheels of both vehicles slipped either right at launch or before hitting 30 miles per hour. I also experienced momentary torque steer on the GT Performance Edition when I stomped on the accelerator from a dead stop.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Those tiny peel-outs are expected on the GT. It&#8217;s rolling with the same multi-link suspension found in the regular Mach-E. The GT Performance Edition though is the first Ford EV to be outfitted with a MagneRide suspension system. While it&#8217;s great at reducing body roll in the corners, it seems to need a bit more tweaking to keep the back end from diving during take-offs to reduce wheel slippage in the front.</span>Driving both vehicles on the same day, I was able to see the benefits of MagneRide both on the freeway and during spirited backroad driving. While the GT offered up suitable handling around corners, it displayed far more body roll than the more expensive GT Performance Edition. This was especially noticeable in hairpin turns where the Performance Edition held its own while I found the GT diving to the outside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking of cornering, while both vehicles are AWD, they both displayed slight understeer which isn&#8217;t much of a surprise. On the second day of driving though, Ford placed me on an autocross track with the GT Performance Edition, and with traction control turned off, the vehicle felt more neutral around corners and did lend itself to some slight oversteer when pushed.</p>
<h2>BlueCruise</h2>
<p>While driving the GT, I had my first encounter with Ford&#8217;s hands-free driver assistance system, BlueCruise. Like Super Cruise from GM, the Level 2 system allows the driver to remove their hands from the wheel under certain circumstances. Like Super CCruise, the system is geofenced to pre-mapped divided highways and uses a driver monitoring system to make sure the person behind the wheel is paying attention to the road. Ford says that BlueCruise is available on both vehicles as part of the optional $1,900 Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Package.</p>
<p>During my tests, I found the system to be slightly less robust than GM&#8217;s offering with a bit more ping-ponging of the vehicle in the lane after tight corners. In one instance, I took over the steering duties when I felt the vehicle hadn&#8217;t turned sharp enough and felt that it would glide into the next lane. On a majority of corners and when traveling in a straight line, it handled changing traffic conditions and cut-ins proficiently. If I spent too much time looking at the infotainment screen rather than the road ahead I was appropriately scolded by the system.</p>
<p>I do wish the audible warnings were a bit louder and that Ford added a light bar or warning lights to the vehicle&#8217;s steering wheel in addition to the dash cluster to warn when I need to pay attention or when BlueCruise&#8217;s hands-free feature was about to disengage. BMW, GM and Mercedes use on-wheel indicators; it&#8217;s a shame that Ford has decided not to follow their leads.</p>
<h2>Interior: same, yet different</h2>
<p>While the interior is the same at the regular Mach-E, the materials have received an upgrade with new seats. In the GT, sport-style seats add a bit more side bolstering to keep drivers in their seats while cornering. The new seats are comfortable without being overbearingly sporting.</p>
<p>The seats in the GT Performance Edition are another issue. The Performance seats have an additional element at the shoulder line that was uncomfortable no matter how I situated my six-foot three-inch frame. Shorter drivers might be fine with it, but I couldn&#8217;t get comfortable and was happy when I switched over the GT.</p>
<p>Like the regular Mach-E, the two GTs are home to Ford&#8217;s 15.5-inch portrait display with Sync 4A. The infotainment system displayed only a slight bit of latency and its large surface area reminds you that this is the future of vehicles. Most features were only a few taps away and the large volume knob near the bottom of the display is still one of my favorite features on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Climate controls are handled by the infotainment system, which I&#8217;m not a fan of, but adjusting the temperature was relatively painless since the controls are always available at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The rear seats in both vehicles are still comfortable even for taller adults and along with a cavernous frunk, the Mach-E&#8217;s 29.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats is enough to haul four to five pieces of medium-sized luggage.</p>
<h2>Battery and range</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2215871" style="width: 1956px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215871" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215871 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg" alt="ford mustang mach e gt-baldwin" width="1946" height="928" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg 1946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=768,366 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=680,324 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=1536,732 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1946px) 100vw, 1946px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2215871" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p>
<p>All that fun GT does come at a price beyond the rather steep cost differential over the $42,895 base model Mach-E.</p>
<p>For all the extra power, you lose range. The extended range Mach-E (starting at $50,775) has 306 miles of range. The Mach-E GT tops out at 270 miles, while the GT Performance Edition needs to be hooked up to the power grid after 260 miles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, both support charging at up to 150-kW at DC fast-charging stations, better yet, they feature plug and charge which means if you have an account set up with a charging station like electrify America, you just plug in the vehicle and it starts transferring that sweet electricity to the vehicle&#8217;s battery without using an app or credit card. It just recognizes the vehicle.</p>
<h2>Which to get</h2>
<p>The Mach-E GT Performace Edition makes a compelling case for dropping an extra $5,000 for slightly more power but better suspension. The reality is, most of these will never see a track or use Ford&#8217;s Mach-E track mode Unbrilded Extend feature. It&#8217;s more likely that these will be daily drivers that see more traffic than track time. If that&#8217;s the case, the $1,900 driver assistance package with hands-free BlueCruise is likely money better spent.</p>
<p>Either choice someone makes, they&#8217;ll get a driving experience from an EV that we might not agree is a Mustang, but we can definitely concede that it&#8217;s deserving of the GT badge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest sign that that the tech industry is pivoting towards climate and sustainability, Atlantic Food Labs &#8211; an offshoot of the <a href="https://atlanticlabs.de/">Berlin fund Atlantic Labs</a> headed by long-time tech investor Christophe F. Maire &#8211; is relaunching as <a href="https://www.foodlabs.com/">FoodLabs</a>, with a dedicated €100m FoodTech fund to invest in food, health, and sustainability startups.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Atlantic Food Labs has been an investor in startups such as Infarm.com, SanityGroup.com, Formo.bio, Mushlabs.com, Mitte.co, Choco.com, Stenon.io and Gorillas.io. With the new fund, FoodLabs is doubling down on the sector.</p>
<p>Focusing on Intellectual Property and “scalable digital business models toward a more efficient and sustainable food industry from earth to earth, from agriculture, production, distribution, human health to zero waste.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Maire said: “The food industry is the largest industry in the world, and it accounts for more than a quarter of greenhouse emissions globally. Transforming how we produce and consume food toward more efficiency and sustainability, has a major impact on the planet and people. We strongly believe that technology and entrepreneurship hold the key to tackling the key challenges of our time. With the Food Fund we will back the most ambitious founders building outlier companies that pave the way for healthier nutrition, sustainable agriculture, better access to food.”<br />
 <br />
In a call with me, he said: “I started the food labs five years ago because simply I felt the food industry is one of the most relevant industries for human health but one of the most irrelevant industries to the climate. I believe that entrepreneurs can help us solve some of the key issues of our time. We started, relatively small, so we invested around $15 million, but along the way, I discovered that the potential is much bigger than I ever imagined. So now we setting up this 100 million. Euro fund. I have a great team and all the people who are really into the mission. And I think this is the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my career. It&#8217;s a fantastic space and it&#8217;s very fascinating.”</p>
<p>The first companies across of the new fund include:</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.foodji.com/">Foodji</a> (D), a digital solution for fresh and healthy food to go</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.tryhabitual.com/">Habitual</a> (UK), a digital health startup providing digital diabetes reversal direct to consumers</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.kitch.io/">Kitch</a> (P) offering a Software for delivery services</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.klim.eco/">Klim</a> (D) with the mission to make agriculture more sustainable through carbon farming</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://getvoila.com/">getVoila</a> (D), bringing fine dining from Europe’s best restaurants to everyone’s living room.</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://microharvest.com/">Microharvest</a> (D)  Providing access to sustainably produced nutrients and proteins.</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.hellomyota.com/">Myota</a> (CH)</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://de.yababa.com/">Yababa</a> (D) a fast-delivery company for oriental food</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.theplate.org/">The Plate</a>, a culinary creator platform</p>
<p>●       <a href="https://airfarm.io/en">Airfarm</a> (D) an AgriTech company providing a digital platform for farmers.</p>
<p>It’s also announcing the launch of its Entrepreneur in Residence program for scientists.</p>
<p>Maire added: “We strongly believe that Europe will become the epicenter of FoodTech &amp; AgTech innovation. Europe has always been strong with scientific research and engineering expertise, but lagging behind with a support system for entrepreneurship. Our mission is to build an international platform for innovation and sustainability in the food industry, bringing together entrepreneurship, scientific know-how from universities and research institutions, as well as major industry players.” <br />
 <br />
Patrick Huber, General Partner at FoodLabs said: “Over the last years we have been impressed by the scientists who joined us to build exceptional companies. We strongly believe that the collaboration of scientists and entrepreneurs will be key to bring radical innovation to the food value chain.”</p>
<p>Maire told me: “We start with agriculture and agriculture methods that will capture more carbon. So we have, for instance, a company that&#8217;s focusing on permaculture, which I think is much bigger than people imagine. We also look at aquaculture, new proteins, new methods of production, new methods of distribution. Quick commerce, local sourcing, new consumer behavior. So, food and health, because what&#8217;s fascinating about this space is that it&#8217;s not just a push on the side of the entrepreneur, it&#8217;s very much a pull up from the consumer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The former UK minster of state for what is now the digital and culture department, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a>, has warned of the looming battle in parliament over the exact shape of incoming online safety legislation.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Ed Vaizey &#8212; a former Conservative Party MP, now Lord Vaizey of Didcot, who was head of the culture, comms and creative industries department, as it was then, between 2010 and 2016 &#8212; predicted a huge tug-of-war to influence the scope of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety Bill</a>, warning that parliamentarians everywhere will try to hang their own &#8220;hobby horse&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>The risk of over regulation or creating a disproportionate burden for startups vs tech giants is also real, Vaizey suggested, setting out several areas that he said would require a cautious approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wTf9uvXCxe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/embed/#?secret=wTf9uvXCxe" data-secret="wTf9uvXCxe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In theory it&#8217;s just going to be the big platforms that will be regulated,&#8221; he said of the scope of the Internet Safety Bill, which was published in draft form <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">back in May</a> &#8212; and which critics are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57569336">warning will be catastrophic for free speech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some platforms that should be regulated could potentially not be be regulated. But you&#8217;re right that people are concerned that, in effect, there&#8217;s a paradox &#8212; that it could help the Facebooks of this world because the regulatory hurdles that get going might be too big. And if anyone is capable of being regulated it&#8217;s Facebook, as opposed to a startup. So I think that&#8217;s something we have to be very careful of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, although I support the principle of legal but harmful content being regulated I have no doubt at all that that is going to be the big battle in parliament. The balance between legal but harmful free speech is going to be a huge battleground. And it will be interesting to see in what form it survives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;And thirdly &#8212; I think, paradoxically &#8212; everyone is going to try and hang their own particular hobby horse on this piece of legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>With sweeping goals for the Online Safety (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">neé Harms</a>) Bill from the get-go &#8212; the government is proposing to make online platforms tackle not just illegal but harmful content, which could mean everything from terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse material to racism, bullying, pro-suicide and pro-eating disorder content to anti-vaxxer views &#8212; the draft legislation has attracted plenty of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">concern</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">controversy</a> already, and the formal parliamentary debate hasn&#8217;t even started yet.</p>
<p>The &#8216;hobby horse&#8217; risk could mean a vast encrusting of an already wide-ranging proposal for Internet regulation, with MPs trying to barnacle on all sorts of issues and grievances that can be loosely attached to the digital sphere. But it will be UK tech businesses saddled with risk and regulatory red tape at the end of the process, while fundamental British values like freedom of expression could be caught and crushed in the middle.</p>
<p>Signs of MPs&#8217; appetite to shoehorn random pet peeves into what some have dubbed a &#8220;<a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/14984">kitchen sink bill</a>&#8221; are plain to see.</p>
<p>Just last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/labour4decrim/status/1446514017917444113/photo/1">concerns</a> were raised that anti-sex work campaigners intend to target the bill to include clauses against &#8220;online pimping&#8221;, for example. So a &#8220;battleground&#8221; sounds like a polite way to characterize the looming cacophony of arguments in parliament over what does and doesn&#8217;t get stuffed into this Great British Internet rulebook&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there nothing which someone won’t try to shoehorn into the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnlineSafetyBill?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OnlineSafetyBill</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash; Neil Brown (@neil_neilzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_neilzone/status/1446346680257990658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Vaizey gave the example of online scams as one likely target for amendments to further extend the scope of the Online Safety Bill. Although provisions to target ad scams are probably one of the less controversial additions that could come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I obviously do not support online scams but it&#8217;s pretty obvious that people will try to put amendments down to make sure that certain things are caught which are not currently in the scope of the bill. And one has to be careful it doesn&#8217;t get weighed down with too many, too much regulation &#8212; so there are all sorts of weird contradictions,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;It could be gutted, it could be fattened up, depending on who prevails in parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also generally welcomed the plan &#8212; saying the government deserves praise for drafting what he described as a &#8220;pioneering&#8221; bill and arguing that Internet regulation is &#8220;long overdue&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a pioneering piece of legislation. People will criticize this legislation, of course. My view is you can&#8217;t let the best be the enemy of the good. It is not &#8212; by no means &#8212; going to be perfect when it arrives in parliament. And it will probably not be perfect when it emerges out of parliament. And as it&#8217;s implemented by Ofcom in the next few years there will be areas of mistakes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think that tech regulation of this kind is long overdue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very important countries like Canada and Australia, and indeed the European Union and the US are looking at this and they will look to the UK example and take lessons from it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ofcom chair role</h2>
<p>The former minister of state has recently been in the running for a key vacancy atop Ofcom, the UK telecoms and media regulator which is itself in the process of being fattened up for an expanded role overseeing Internet content and social media giants.</p>
<p>The government has said it wants to give Ofcom <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">powers to levy fines of up to 10%</a> of a company’s annual global turnover (or £18M, whichever is higher) if they fail to live up to the bill&#8217;s requirements to protect users from illegal or harmful content.</p>
<p>So the regulator is set to have major powers to influence tech giants&#8217; approach to content moderation and online freedom of expression in the coming years.</p>
<p>Vaizey was interviewed for the role of chair of Ofcom and shortlisted by an independent panel. However, earlier this year, the then secretary of state for digital, Olivier Dowden, chose to rerun the competition &#8212; rather than pick a candidate from the whittled down shortlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57265431">Reports </a>have suggested the government was unhappy that the independent panel rejected its preferred candidate, ex-<em>Daily Mail</em> editor Paul Dacre &#8212; and that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/31/ministers-struggle-to-find-people-to-interview-paul-dacre-for-ofcom-job">still trying to find a way to parachute</a> the divisive former newspaper editor into the top job overseeing social media platforms&#8217; compliance with legally binding content rules.</p>
<p>Vaizey sidestepped these rumors when asked if he&#8217;s still in the running for the Ofcom job &#8212; suggesting the government decided to rerun the competition because of a lack of applicants in the first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the government felt it needed a more competitive field. So it may be that I only got an interview because so few people applied,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I really enjoyed the interview and I would love to chairman of Ofcom so I&#8217;ll see when they reopen the process whether there&#8217;s an opportunity for me to apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ofcom is at a point where it&#8217;s proven itself as a telecoms regulator, and I think to a certain extent as a media regulator. But it is entering uncharted and very exciting territory in terms of Internet regulation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked what his priorities would be, were he to get the dream job chairing Ofcom, Vaizey said Internet safety would top his list &#8212; on account of how challenging overseeing the digital realm will be.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is going to be the biggest challenge for Ofcom; how do you absorb such an enormous role? And also how you communicate to the public or the stakeholders that this will be a work in progress?,&#8221; he said, predicting: &#8220;It will not emerge fully formed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were he to give a &#8220;light critique&#8221; of Ofcom, Vaizey said it would be that the regulator needs to dial up its &#8216;pro-business&#8217; flank.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can also be pro-consumer by being pro-business,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;And I think in a highly competitive area&#8230; the job of the regulator is not only to regulate but also to know when not to regulate and to step back and let businesses navigate a very complex and competitive environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if I was to bring any kind of &#8216;Vaizey-esque&#8217; approach to Ofcom it would be to make sure that businesses felt they had a regulator that wasn&#8217;t too much on their case, and was as much a partner as much as a regulator.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Data adequacy</h2>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the former minister of state for his views on the government&#8217;s appetite to &#8216;reform&#8217; data protection rules.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">Last month</a> the government announced a consultation on a data reform, suggesting that &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules in this area would be better for business.</p>
<p>Currently, UK privacy rules are based on the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which is considered the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; for protecting people&#8217;s digital information globally. But the UK government&#8217;s policy push appears to favor reducing this current high level of protection for UK citizens&#8217; information &#8212; without presenting a coherent economic case for why lower domestic privacy standards will be an advantage for digital businesses.</p>
<p>The government has made the simplistic claim that easier access to data will somehow stoke &#8216;innovation&#8217;. However UK startups wanting to access the European market &#8212; or indeed US companies subject to rules like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">California&#8217;s CCPA</a> &#8212; will continue to need to comply with robust privacy regulations elsewhere.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK dials up the spin on data reform, claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules will drive &#8216;responsible&#8217; data sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/embed/#?secret=dYCdoTe2Wo" data-secret="dYCdoTe2Wo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On data reform, Vaziey suggested there could be room to make the practical implementation of UK data protection rules less &#8220;onerous&#8221; for UK businesses and organizations without undermining key principles of privacy and protection for personal data.</p>
<p>But on those principles he warned that the UK staying aligned with European Union standards will be vital for the digital economy &#8212; saying it would be &#8220;disastrous&#8221; were the UK to lose the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">data adequacy agreement with the EU</a> that allows for continued free flows of data from Europe to the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK was very influential in how data protection legislation was drawn up when we were members of the EU so I think it&#8217;s slightly odd that we should shy away from that legislation,&#8221; Vaizey also told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very EU defining thing &#8212; and so I think the biggest watchword for the government when they look at reforming data protection legislation is obviously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">what&#8217;s gone on with the US</a> [which has had two data transfer agreements with the European Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">struck down</a> by Europe&#8217;s top court].</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not want a position where you make yourself vulnerable to attacks by the EU to say that your data protection regime is not adequate and we can&#8217;t therefore have cross-border exchanges of data &#8212; that would be disastrous. So whether we like it or not we will have to keep to a certain extent in lock-step with the European Union.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oTH2qrGf6Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=oTH2qrGf6Y" data-secret="oTH2qrGf6Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I also think it&#8217;s the case that the European Union legislation&#8230; has become the gold standard of data protection,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If you look at California adopting data privacy legislation it is based on European legislation and most tech companies will comply with that as their default standard because it just makes their life a hell of a lot easier when they&#8217;re trading globally.&#8221;</p>
<h2>UK must stay open to tech skills</h2>
<p>Vaizey has just taken up a new appointment as patron of the digital skills-focused UK industry association <a href="https://www.theitp.org">ITP</a>, aka the Institute of Telecommunications Professionals.</p>
<p>Discussing the skills challenges facing the country he said there is no room for complacency &#8212; given rising global demand and increasingly fierce competition for tech talent around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are doing really well and we continue to do very well but as with any area you cannot afford complacency and all the tools are there with the right resources to really push forward,&#8221; he said, discussing the government&#8217;s approach to skills &#8212; which now includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">ten-year strategy to boost domestic AI capability</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;One looks at what [president] <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Macron has done in France</a> and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that he took France from a standing start&#8230; He&#8217;s done a tremendous job of raising the profile of France as a tech-friendly nation. So I think we can&#8217;t afford to be complacent. We&#8217;ve got a lot going for us but we can move up another gear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaizey also queried whether the government will take what he said must be a necessarily &#8220;open&#8221; approach to immigration to ensure UK startups are able to thrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only does every country in the world have this problem but every startup in any European country is competing for talent, and any startup in the US is competing for talent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see that with <a href="https://technation.io/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI74_l3PbB8wIVRvhRCh0tUATWEAAYASAAEgJaLPD_BwE">Tech Nation</a> and so on there are more entrepreneur visas available but I think the government has to be very open to the fact that to get people over with the right tech skills to support startups has to be an absolute priority. And they have to be flexible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when we had free movement [as part of the EU] one of the great advantages of free movement is that you could take a job and you knew that your partner would also be able to get a job in the UK as well. So that&#8217;s something that they really need to lean into.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a>, an African startup that helps connect consumers’ bank accounts to financial applications, has raised a $15 million Series A round, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, led by Tiger Global &#8212; the VC firm’s third major investment in Africa this year after <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/amp/">Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/amp/">FairMoney</a> &#8212; also had participation from new investors Target Global (an investor in neobank Kuda), General Catalyst, and SBI Investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors were joined by existing ones including Entree Capital, Lateral Capital, Golden Palm Investments, Acuity VC, and Ingressive Capital, bringing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono’s total raise to a little over $17.5 million since launching last year.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215852" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of the population is</span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> either unbanked or underbanked.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open finance players in Africa like Mono &#8212; mirroring Plaid’s success in the U.S. market to theirs &#8212; thrives on the notion that access to a financial ecosystem via open APIs will improve access to financial information and lower entry costs for the underbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the likes of Okra, Plaid, Stitch and OnePipe also streamlining various financial data in single APIs, the battle to provide customers’ financial information to companies and third-party developers is heating up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely, hence the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to ship more innovative products down the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mono’s case, two products give it an edge, according to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan. First, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DirectPay, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product that helps Nigerian businesses to collect bank transfer payments from customers within their web or mobile app without using their debit cards. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hink of what Flutterwave and Paystack have done with cards; Mono wants to do with bank accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement Pages allows businesses to access customers’ financial accounts without needing a developer; Hassan calls it the first of its kind in Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even with these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features tailored to a Nigerian audience, Mono is going after other markets like Ghana and Kenya, first mentioned by the CEO in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono has delivered on only Ghana, for now, piloting with a few banks and fintechs such as Oze and Tranzo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya, on the other hand, is still within its radar as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one out of three countries (including Egypt and South Africa) Mono plans to expand into next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan adds that Mono might complete the move to South Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via a partnership with Absa bank this year.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria&#8217;s Mono raises millions to power the internet economy in Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/embed/#?secret=QB0lqhPg7p" data-secret="QB0lqhPg7p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When open finance startups in Africa began to gain some attention last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the consensus was that each company could do significant business in the big individual markets they had first launched with. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t seem that way anymore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as Mono, Stitch, Pngme and Okra now operate in other African markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is capped</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how many businesses we can target,” said Hassan, who co-founded Mono with Prakhar Singh, over a call.</span></p>
<p>By the end of next year, Mono will be present in five African countries, a move that slightly suggests that the company might be spreading itself too thin.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questioned whether investor pressure or competition was fuelling the need for Mono to expand quickly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan reckoned that the company made such decisions solely because of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything that we do at Mono is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer-driven. Customers who want to launch lending or fintech apps in these countries say they can’t do so unless Mono is there,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on how we’ve built our relationship and the kind of products we’ve built in Nigeria, people rely on us and say when we go to a country, they would also want to launch there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also a vertical expansion play for the company as it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks to offer enterprise solutions to FMCGs, law firms — non-tech and traditional industries with the capability to command more transaction volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking of numbers, Mono claims to have processed over 200 million financial data transactions from over 270 businesses, developers, and fintechs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also said it has connected over 150,000 bank accounts in the last two months and is growing 45x year-on-year in that regard. With around 30 staffers today, Mono doubled its headcount from the previous year, according to its CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activity in the global open finance market has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ironically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buoyed by Visa’s failed takeover target of Plaid. And investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not slowed down in backing startups in other regions which they feel could be major acquisition targets for the U.S. company if it decides to expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono is one such candidate in Africa and lead investor Tiger Global knows that. According to Hassan, the VC firm reached out to lead a new round and though Mono didn’t plan to raise any additional capital this year, the capital from Tiger Global would help it grow faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team at Tiger felt we were doing something amazing but thought what we had raised wouldn’t help us build a big company. And they were like, ‘we want to help you build a big company,” said Hassan.</span></p>
<p>Tiger Global confirmed it led the investment in an email to TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of Africa’s fastest-growing startups, Mono has closed early-stage rounds in a manner rarely seen on the continent. Last</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> September, the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/21/mono-raises-500k/"> completed a $500,000 pre-seed</a> investment with a handful of local investors. Then it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">took part</a> in Y Combinator’s most recent winter batch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">raising $2 million in seed funding</a> upon graduation before raising this Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not everyone measures growth this way. These days, startups burn a lot of money to scale fast but have little or no revenue to show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And in Africa, side remarks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are often thrown about on how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such models might lead to long-term unprofitability for high-flying startups such as Mono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if that was a concern to the company, which has a valuation north of $100 million, Hassan said, “the first thing you look for when you’re building a startup is not profitability but I will say that our revenue has grown ten times since our last raise in May</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono’s present revenue is equivalent to what it did in the last three months combined, continued the CEO before referencing how the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is pursuing growth, scale and profitability with a lean team to “build the best open banking platform in Africa.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/mobile-gaming-company-voodoo-acquires-beach-bum/">Voodoo acquired Beach Bum</a>, another French mobile gaming company has news to share. <a href="https://www.homagames.com">Homa Games</a> is raising a $50 million Series A round led by Northzone. The company partners with indie game studios and acts as a publisher.</p>
<p>Other investors in today’s funding round include Singular, King, the founders of FuboTV and Daniel Ek’s family office. The company is raising this Series A round just seven months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyper-casual-game-publisher-homa-games-raises-15-million/">raising its seed round</a> (led by Headline and Eurazeo).</p>
<p>In particular, back in February 2021, the company said it managed to generate 250 million downloads. That number has now doubled as the startup has now delivered 500 million installs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215601" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Homa Games specializes in hypercasual, casual and board games, a segment of the mobile gaming industry that requires a methodical, technology-driven approach. It has developed its own tech stack that optimizes the performance of each game.</p>
<p>Game developers can build a prototype with Unity and submit it to Homa Games. After that, Homa Games can test the potential of each prototype to find out if it’s worth exploring further.</p>
<p>The startup has developed an all-in-one SDK that helps developers optimize their mobile game through analytics and A/B testing to turn it into a profitable venture. It lets them track and improve the most important metrics of the industry — cost of acquisition, retention and session times. Of couse, this will lead to a better average revenue per user.</p>
<p>Homa Games then takes care of publishing the game on the App Store and Play Store. It relies heavily on advertising to generate revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What’s interesting is that you don’t have to spend months or years to craft the perfect mobile game. With the current state of hypercasual mobile games, game developers focus on one key concept that is going to make you compulsively launch the game again and again. All of Homa Games’ success that ended up in the top 20 of most downloaded games in the App Store and Play Store have been developed in eight days or less.</p>
<p>“Their platform gives any game entrepreneur or independent studio super powers by allowing them to tap into publishing, analytics and marketing tools to compete on an even footing with the giant game studios across the world. Daniel and Oliver don’t just bring a vision but more importantly, a killer execution that is helping them define and build an entirely new category within gaming,” Northzone’s Pär-Jörgen Pärson said in a statement.</p>
<p>So far, the company has released 40 games. But Homa Games is increasing its release pace as 20 games will be released by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>And now, the company is working on a sub-genre of hypercasual games. Homa Games call this the ‘arcade idle’ category. Like in many hypercasual games, it features a texture-less stickman character that you move around the digital world. Like in idle games, players have to gather resources to increase wealth and unlock new levels.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like in Craft Island, Farm Land, and Harvest It:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215602" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215602" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/60c16e652b27de106efd101d_arcade-idle.gif" alt="" width="600" height="302" class="size-full wp-image-2215602" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Homa Games</p></div></p>
<p>According to the company’s <a href="https://www.homagames.com/post/arcade-idle">blog post</a>, the company plans to monetize these games through interstitial ads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. Players can also choose to watch an ad to go faster.</p>
<p>I don’t know if we should celebrate this kind of innovation or not, but it’s clear that there’s still a lot of business potential in mobile gaming. And Homa Games seems well-positioned to become an important publisher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/gogoros-electric-vehicle-technology-will-make-its-china-debut-through-a-deal-with-yadea-and-dcj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing a deal</a> with two of China’s biggest two-wheel vehicle makers, Gogoro officially launched there today, opening 45 battery swapping stations in Hangzhou. The company’s co-founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke told TechCrunch that it targets 80 stations by the end of the year, before expanding into other major cities with its partners, Yadea and Dachangjiang Group (DCJ).</p>
<p>In China, Gogoro’s battery swapping technology will operate under the Huan Huan brand, a partnership between Gogoro, Yadea and DCJ.</p>

<p>Yadea and DCJ are both developing vehicles that run on Gogoro’s battery swapping technology, with Yadea launching two models for sale today, starting in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The companies expect consumer demand to be <a href="https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1903231745/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven by government regulations</a> for electric two-wheel vehicles that (among other things) require the use of lithium batteries instead of lead-acid. An estimated 270 million vehicles that don’t meet the new regulations will need to be retired by 2025.</p>
<p>Gogoro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gogoro-will-go-public-on-nasdaq-after-2-35b-spac-deal/">announced last month</a> that it will go public on Nasdaq after a $2.35 billion SPAC deal with Poema Global that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to its battery swapping network, Gogoro is also known for its own range of high-end two-wheel scooters, but has made deals with other manufacturers to produce vehicles that use its batteries and charging stations, including Yamaha, Suzuki and AeonMotor.</p>
<p>Its partnerships have been an important factor in increasing the accessibility of Gogoro’s technology, and the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a deal this year</a> with Hero MotoCorp, the market leader for two-wheeled vehicles in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’ve always been looked at as ‘Gogoro is too premium, we are out of reach to the people that really matter in major cities,’ and with Yadea and DCJ, everyone is going to be able to ride and buy the vehicles, which won’t be any more expensive than previously-sold mass vehicles,” said Luke.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw a rager at the new Berlin gigafactory on Saturday – complete with bright lights, techno music, a Ferris wheel, carousel, arcade and vegetarian food trucks – to announce the start of production at the disputed site that&#8217;s faced lawsuits by environmental groups.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">&#8220;We&#8217;re aiming to start production in a few months, basically, November or December, and hopefully deliver our first cars in December,&#8221; said Musk at the event to the applause of thousands of fans. &#8220;But starting production is kind of the easy part. The hard part is reaching volume production.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Volume production amounts to 5,000 or &#8220;hopefully 10,000&#8221; vehicles per week, said Musk. The factory is expected to manufacture Model Y vehicles, in addition to millions of battery cells. Tesla submitted plans to invest around $5.8 billion in a battery plant with 50 GWh capacity next to the 300-hectare site, and Musk promised volume production of battery cells by the end of the year. <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37594789/vw-battery-tech-new-laboratory/">Volkswagen&#8217;s planned factory in Salzgitter</a> is expected to produce 40 GWh capacity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215839" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="AdSlot__slot___1GI9_W">
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Construction on the Tesla gigafactory in Berlin-Brandenburg, which was granted two years ago by authorities under an exceptional procedure, is nearly complete, despite opposition from locals who are holding up final approval for the plant due to environmental concerns. Musk&#8217;s over-the-top event looks to be an attempt to win over the natives, an almost cartoonish move reminiscent of<em> Stranger Things</em>&#8216; <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Larry_Kline">Mayor Kline</a> throwing an Independence Day festival to win votes and distract from the Russians he had leased land to in order to open yet another otherworldly portal.</p>

<p data-testid="paragraph-7">Locals filed more than 800 complaints that are being discussed via an online residents&#8217; consultation process, which is due to close on October 14, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/musk-s-plane-takes-off-to-berlin-ahead-of-tesla-plant-party">according to Bloomberg</a>. Only then will environmental authorities make a final decision on approval.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-7">Despite pushback, Tesla has a 95% chance at gaining factory approval, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-brandenburg-factory-becomes-festival-site-giga-fest-2021-10-09/">according to Brandenburg&#8217;s economy minister</a>. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Tesla factory, which is currently hiring widely throughout Europe, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/whats-happening-with-teslas-7-billion-german-gigafactory-2021-06-22/">is in favor</a> with many political parties in the country who see it as a major economic boost for eastern Germany. </span></p>
</div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Musk defended the factory against critics saying it used &#8220;relatively little&#8221; water and that battery production would be &#8220;sustainable.&#8221;</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>After first hitting that sweet trillion dollar valuation, then surpassing two trillion, Apple is likely well aware that it&#8217;s a long road ahead to becoming the first quadrillion dollar company and they&#8217;re going to have to make some controversial choices to get there. Jokes aside, Apple&#8217;s business is actually changing quite a bit as it reaches mega-scale and the company is flirting with growth tactics that could either be seen as bold and aggressive or as a little over the line.</p>
<p>As Apple&#8217;s diversifying business shifts from simply getting consumers to buy new iPhones towards getting them to buy Apple devices while locking them in to subscription software services on said devices, they&#8217;re starting to get a little pushier than they used to be.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-calls-out-apple-for-promoting-its-services-in-the-iphone-settings-screen/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple for putting advertisements in its Settings app for its own services</a>, launching a critique that Apple wasn&#8217;t playing by its own rules. His complaint was probably intended to be more focused on alleging Apple&#8217;s anti-competitiveness but my first takeaway after seeing an advertisement for an Apple Music free trial inside the Settings app, was &#8220;Damn, Apple isn&#8217;t that a little gauche?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For a $2 trillion company, pushing consumers to buy something inside the section of the app they usually go to when they&#8217;re trying to fix something seems like a pretty embarrassing growth hack. Sure, it&#8217;s just one ad slot, one slip up, but the lack of spam and crapware has long been a hallmark of the Apple device ecosystem. Sure, over the years maybe you didn&#8217;t like having their standard calculator or stocks app pre-installed but it wasn&#8217;t anything too troubling, but as Apple starts pushing paid subscription after paid subscription with a varying array of services including Music, News+ tv+, Fitness+, Arcade, iCloud+ and others, one begins to wonder where this all leads.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not new — mine rotates between Arcade and Music daily — triggered by new device purchase that comes with the services <a href="https://t.co/37nS7sarKk">pic.twitter.com/37nS7sarKk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rich Greenfield, LightShed (@RichLightShed) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichLightShed/status/1445898886816669700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple is starting to build more complex subscriber products as well that live outside of a single app; its iCloud+ service now blends backups with more sophisticated privacy features in Safari only available to paying customers. Varying levels of Apple One memberships bundle these services together at discounts that can be shared with family members. And sure, to Sweeney&#8217;s point, this is all going to be very frustrating for developers that are trying to compete with a product that has home court advantage in perpetuity, but it also leads to a less welcoming platform for consumers who simply want devices that bring them objectively to the broader web and all its stakeholders and services.</p>
<p>For a blanket disclaimer, I will say that Apple gets criticized so much over seemingly petty things because they generally have done a pretty solid job streamlining positive consumer experiences with their devices, and consumers have also grown accustomed to seeing other companies let these little things snowball into misplaced incentives that slowly erode a product. That&#8217;s why seeing a couple more promotional push notifications than normal or a seemingly misplaced ad or a few too many introductory offers when sparking up a new devices raises some red flags.</p>
<p>Apple turning into a services business is certainly no crime, but it&#8217;s important to realize that doing so likely requires a shift in what their relationship with consumers fundamentally looks like. We&#8217;re only starting to taste some of those changes today, but they may become much more visible down the road.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>I&#8217;m going to play around with this section a bit over the next few weeks, so it&#8217;s fewer cold summaries and more context&#8230; let me know on Twitter if this is your jam or if you prefer more headlines and less bloviating :)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/"><strong>Twitch hack spells future trouble for game streaming kingpin</strong></a><br />
Amazon&#8217;s gaming-centric streaming service had a pretty bad week as hackers released a trove of source code and creator payout data. It&#8217;s a pretty huge competitive loss for Twitch and leaves Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming with a spreadsheet of data to poach exclusive streamers to their platform. It&#8217;s also probably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">demoralizing</a> for the streamer base, with streamers now able to clock just how much more some of their competitors are hauling in from paid by the streaming giant.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s outsized lead in the game streamer wars has been slowly shrinking largely as a result of efforts from YouTube and Facebook to attract viewers. Twitch is still the default many early career streamers choose though and YouTube and Facebook are miles behind in this department, their success has largely come from dumping money into paid partner programs to bring popular content creators on board, meaning that the data that just leaked is pretty priceless to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/"><b>Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp&#8217;s god-awful week</b></a><br />
Facebook is having a pretty rough few weeks but this past one was just plain brutal. While the company was waging a PR war on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower</a>, the service suffered its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/"> most brutal outage of likely the past decade</a>, taking all of the company&#8217;s global services down and breaking its internal tools in the meantime. Everything was down for several hours, meaning plenty of confusion and frustration, particularly for user that rely on WhatsApp so heavily for their business or social life.</p>
<p>As I wrote last week, Facebook probably doesn&#8217;t deserve to be the only internet media platform getting universally dumped on, but even with so much public anger, I get the feeling that executives at the company can&#8217;t see past the fact that they feel they&#8217;re being treated unfairly and that they aren&#8217;t even trying to self-reflect. Facebook&#8217;s brand is in a pretty sustained state of decay at this point, but the idea that it might be spreading to its subsidiaries like Instagram should be a cause that leadership and shareholders realize is too critical to meaningfully ignore.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/">Paying real money for fake shares of real startups</a><br />
</b>I can&#8217;t say this is as impactful as the two bits above, but I&#8217;d be remiss not to rehash a saga I covered this week that really feels like it showcases where we&#8217;re at in this bull market. Visionrare, an NFT platform for &#8220;fantasy startup investing&#8221; was born earlier this week and I covered its launch with a good amount of skepticism. It essentially was a pitch to treat venture capital investing like fantasy sports and get people competing to build their own portfolio full of synthetic NFT shares of startups.</p>
<p>Plenty of investors and entrepreneurs chimed in after my launch post and detailed all of the ways it was likely going to get sued, and it seems the founders listened. Less than a day after going into public beta,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/fantasy-startup-investing-nft-platform-visionrare-shuts-down-paid-marketplace-after-a-day-in-open-beta/"> they shut down the marketplace</a>, promising an eventual return return with a free-to-play version. As full of funny money as the NFT market seems (and often is), plenty of top NFT project founders spend an awful long time hashing out mechanics with lawyers ahead of time so that they don&#8217;t get saddled with these hard choices after launch. Speaking of funny money, this <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/art-blocks/mint/13000109/">piece of generative art</a> sold for $6.9 million this week and this <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/cryptoadz/mint/1519/">toad</a> went for 420 ETH ($1.5 million), enjoy your weekend!</p>

&#8220;&#8230;Since the back half of 2020 kicked off and the venture capital and startup worlds discovered that COVID and its related economic impacts were largely set to miss the upstart technology market, investors have been busy stuffing ever-larger amounts of cash into new companies around the world. The acceleration of capital deployment has generated more unicorns, more mega-rounds and simply more available dollars than ever before in the history of startups&#8230;&#8221;</p>

&#8220;&#8230;every Disrupt, we host a session we call Pitch Deck Teardown. It’s a convivial workshop where founders in the audience send me their decks, and I walk through a curated set of them live in front of an exceptional VC panel, who critique the deck slide by slide. This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, we were joined by Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.january.ventures/">January Ventures</a>; Vanessa Larco, partner at <a href="https://www.nea.com/">NEA</a>; and Ben Ling, founder and general partner of <a href="https://www.blingcap.com/">Bling Capital</a>&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/"><b>Top VCs weigh in on how to raise your first dollars</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Index Ventures partner Nina Achadijan started out by urging founders to first consider whether they actually really need to raise venture capital. &#8216;It’s a phenomenal time to be an early-stage entrepreneur. There’s more capital than ever before and there’s a willingness to accept technology from consumers and businesses,&#8217; she said. &#8216;And quite frankly, there’s a lot of platform shifts that are very exciting for early-stage entrepreneurs. But the first thing you need to do is ask yourself: Do you really need to raise venture capital? There are so many incredible businesses that can be built that actually don’t need VC funding.'&#8221;</p>
