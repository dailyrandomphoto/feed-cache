					<description><![CDATA[What do you do to build a deck that can’t be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of pitch decks, and only a handful of winners. Such is the math of the VC industry right now, what with an explosion of startups and dreams of glory launching every year. VCs are overwhelmed with pitches, which means that crafting the perfect deck and connecting with a reader in the few seconds you have their attention is critical.</p>
<p>So what do you do to build a deck that can’t be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> who have probably read more decks collectively than any group of humans should ever be expected to. Mar Hershenson is founding managing partner at <a href="https://www.pear.vc">Pear VC</a>, Mercedes Bent is a partner at <a href="https://lsvp.com">Lightspeed</a>, and Saba Karim is the head of global startup pipeline at <a href="https://www.techstars.com">TechStars</a>.</p>
<p>In our discussion, we covered what’s changing with pitches as the world moves toward a hybrid in-person and virtual pitch model, discussed how deep tech startups should think about pitches, and then we wrapped by exploring how each panelist reads decks — and what that portends for founders who don’t want to be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats">The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats</h2>
<p>We got right into the crux of the matter at the top of the panel: What does reading pitch decks feel like in 2021? For Hershenson, there’s just always more under the sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say the volume of pitches that we receive has increased and continues to increase at some form of exponential rate. For us, we have to become far more efficient at sorting and reading through these decks. The actual reading of the individual deck hasn&#8217;t changed, but the rate and volume have increased dramatically. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:01)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bent noted that the bar has gone up for the quality of decks that she reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The decks are getting better and better in terms of design. I think more and more people have realized that the visual representation of your deck is just as important as the material and the content that&#8217;s in there. There&#8217;s these instinctive milliseconds that an investor looks at your deck and almost makes a snap judgment about whether it&#8217;s even in the realm of something they want to look at it. Unfortunately, it shouldn&#8217;t be like that, but we&#8217;re human. So I&#8217;m seeing decks that are super polished, and I don&#8217;t know where everyone is getting these great graphics from, but they&#8217;re amazing. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:48)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most pitch decks are based off templates, and therein lies a key trade-off: How much should you rely on a template versus being “original,” but different and perhaps harder to read? Karim noted that sometimes originality can pay off:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best pitch deck that I got in a different format would be from a company that recently got into TechStars — it was actually a podcast version of their pitch deck that had my face on it. I went into Apple Podcasts and it said, “Hey, Saba, here&#8217;s my pitch.” That was amazing! But the second or third time that happens, it might not be as impressive because I&#8217;ve seen it before. <em><b>(Timestamp: 3:41)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hershenson pushed founders to consider keeping to the standard templates because it can help VCs focus on what makes each business unique.</p>
<blockquote><p>For us, having the pitch in a format that we are able to consume in an efficient way is super important. There are a lot of templates online, we all know the key points that need to be hit on in a deck. So your job as a founder is to hit those in a deck of 10 to 15 slides and kind of do the hard work of synthesizing your business in a short format. I think you can be original, but sometimes being original is to your detriment.</p>
<p>I can tell you my own story. When we were first fundraising for Pear, we decided we were going to be really original: We&#8217;re going to use Prezi to send decks to LPs. And that was just totally the wrong call, because it&#8217;s almost like, “What did they just send me?” <em><b>(Timestamp: 4:29)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting dynamics that has shown up in the last year has been the rise of Notion as a form for fundraising. Responses from our panel were muted. Hershenson said Notion isn’t an excuse for not being succinct.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $80 million</a> at a $505 million valuation, blockchain and Web3 development SaaS startup <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alchemy</a> has raised $250 million in a Series C funding round that values the company at $3.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the financing, which was extremely competitive with a number of large venture firms clamoring to not only back the company, but lead the investment, according to sources familiar with the transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that Alchemy increased its valuation by a staggering 7x over a six-month period (that’s a gain of more than $1 billion in value per month), the round is notable for a few other reasons. For one, it represents one of a16z’s largest Web3/blockchain investments to date. In June, the firm revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, illustrating its serious commitment to the space. (For the unacquainted, Web3 refers to a</span><span class="s1"> set of protocols led by blockchain, that intends to reinvent how the Internet is wired in the backend).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s also interesting is that Alchemy has managed to achieve something that remains elusive for most startups: profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO and co-founder Nikil Viswanathan, the company is in fact “very profitable.” It turned that corner over the past few months, he said, as demand for its offering has exploded and revenue grew 15x since its last raise in April. The startup has been doing so well that it hasn’t even touched the $80 million it raised in its Series B, according to Alchemy CTO and co-founder Joe Lau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All that money is still in the bank,” he said. “We didn’t need the money but we saw the value in bringing on great partners, such as Andreessen, which has an incredible team with deep technical expertise in the blockchain space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Alchemy wants to do for blockchain and Web3 what AWS (Amazon Web Services) did for the internet. ​​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s goal is to be the starting place for developers considering building a product on top of a blockchain or mainstream blockchain applications. Its developer tool aims to remove the complexity and costs of building infrastructure while improving applications through “necessary” developer tools. It launched its offering in August of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Alchemy powers a range of transactions across nearly every blockchain vertical, including financial institutions, exchanges, billion-dollar decentralized finance projects and multinational organizations such as UNICEF. It has also quickly become the technology behind every major NFT platform, including MakersPlace, OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and CryptoPunks. Other customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dapper Labs, Axie Infinity, Fortune 500s building on blockchain such as the recently signed Adobe, PricewaterhouseCoopers. It also serves “the majority of DeFi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy powers over $45 billion in transaction volume for companies around the globe. That’s up from $30 billion at the time of its April raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has also expanded the number of blockchains that it powers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform was more or less on Ethereum, but we’ve seen a lot of demand and have since expanded to include Polygon, Optimism and Flow,” Lau said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy has also seen a lot of new developers, noted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viswanathan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had many more teams and companies join Alchemy, and more developers per team or per company are using our platform,” he added. “So we’re seeing growth across all axes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its explosive growth, Alchemy remains a lean team. It currently has 37 employees, up from 22 in April. It is based in San Francisco, with an office in New York and remote employees globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to invest in building a community around blockchain. Alchemy started at the right time, in the execs&#8217; view &#8212; in 2017 when the market was tiny and many still doubted the opportunity in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate goal is to bring the promise of blockchain to life,” Lau said. “We want to fulfill its potential by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating more resources for developers to come into the space and more effectively and more quickly build blockchain products.”</span></p>
<p>Viswanathan believes Alchemy is playing a crucial role in the recent surge and popularity of blockchain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As blockchain has been growing, not only has Alchemy grown, but we have helped the blockchain ecosystem grow because,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s this kind of virtuous cycle &#8212; the more we provide better tooling, the easier it is for developers to build products, and then more users come, so then more developers come so that we make the tooling better, and so on and so forth. So we like to think of ourselves as helping spin that flywheel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225526" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225526" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225526 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225526" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alchemy</p></div></p>
<p><span class="s1">Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (16z), described Alchemy as &#8220;a key driver&#8221; of the growth of blockchain and Web3, and said the startup is already &#8220;the de facto developer platform&#8221; for Web3.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">&#8220;Just as Microsoft and AWS built platforms that powered the computer and internet industries, Alchemy’s platform enables developers to build blockchain products used by millions globally,&#8221; he wrote via email, adding that </span><b></b><span class="s2">Alchemy&#8217;s growth across all relevant metrics has been &#8220;staggering.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google chairman and Stanford University President John L. Hennessy &#8212; who invested in the company&#8217;s last round &#8212; echoed Yahya&#8217;s sentiments. But he also made another, noteworthy comparison: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alchemy is powering the growth of the blockchain industry the same way Amazon Web Services did for the cloud,&#8221; he wrote via e-mail. &#8220;The excitement about their technology reminds me of the early days of Google.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C financing also included participation from new investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Redpoint. Existing backers Coatue, Lee Fixel’s Addition, DFJ and Pantera Capital doubled down on their investments in Alchemy, which has now raised about $345 million in total since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other previous investors in the company includ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e the Chainsmokers’ Mantis, actor Jared Leto and the Glazer family (owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United), Yahoo co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang, Coinbase, SignalFire, Samsung, Stanford University, Charles Schwab, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tarken connects grain buyers and sellers around more transparent pricing for commodities, starting with corn.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian grain trading marketplace <a href="https://www.tarken.ag/en.html#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarken</a> secured $3.5 million in a seed round, co-led by Monashees and Maya, to continue developing its technology that connects grain buyers and sellers and operates an artificial intelligence tool for commodity pricing.</p>
<p>Joining them was Gilgamesh Ventures and individual investors, including Kavak founder Carlos Garcia, Ualá founder Pierpaolo Barbieri, Zap VivaReal Group’s Brian Requarth and DoorDash’s Gokul Rajaram.</p>
<p>Luiz Tângari and Carlos Neto founded Tarken this year after working together in agriculture for the past eight years at Strider, a crop protection systems company they co-founded and later sold to Syngenta in 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After integrating the company, they left and started Tarken, which is initially focused on corn, which Tângari estimates to be a $30 billion market. The National Supply Company (CONAB) from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture estimated <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/092221-brazil-corn-crop-extreme-weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn production in Brazil</a> at 102.6 million metric tons for the 2020-21 growing year.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem in commodity trading is that it is not liquid,” he added. “If you are a farmer growing corn and soy, if you want to sell in a hurry you have to sell at a discount, or you are waiting for weeks for the right prices.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TnbeUraEwe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">As its startup market accelerates, Brazil could be in for an IPO bonanza</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As its startup market accelerates, Brazil could be in for an IPO bonanza&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/embed/#?secret=TnbeUraEwe" data-secret="TnbeUraEwe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He said the United States figured out price variations a decade ago. To give similar transparency to grain trading in Brazil, Tarken set up an AI tool that pulls in data from different sources and generates a price for every Brazilian city, something Tângari said was a mystery before. Buyers and sellers can search a map to see who is selling, at what price and the freight cost to get the product.</p>
<p>The farmer can communicate with the seller and the freight operators, which are vetted by Tarken, and execute the transaction right from the platform, which Tângari said “removes risk from the table.” A process that used to take about 12 weeks — between figuring out the prices, negotiations and product delivery — can now take just days, he added.</p>
<p>“This is a tool combined with education to draw scenarios for strategies to buy and sell,” Tângari added. “Currently, farmers have zero help, and we want to level that. We want to help market players be smarter, have smaller price variations and better liquidity. If we are successful, we will see chicken prices in the market go down 3%.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since Tarken launched four months ago, it has facilitated over 1,000 negotiations and has several hundred open bids for products. The number of negotiations is growing 50% per day, and Tângari expects to close the year with 10,000 registered customers.</p>
<p>Half of the new funding will go toward engineering to continue developing the product, including finishing out the AI tool. The other half will be invested in marketing for the marketplace to attract new customers, building content and education to help growers and buyers understand about trading and sales.</p>
<p>Tângari also notes that Tarken is on track to begin raising a Series A round and expects that to begin in six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo Lima, partner at Monashees, said in a statement that he previously knew Tângari and Neto through an investment in Strider and is backing Tarken for its approach to the agricultural commodities market, which has not seen innovation in recent years.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in the ability to use technology and data to aggregate supply and demand, improve the user experience and build a great marketplace in the region,” Lima said. “We’ve already seen this happening across multiple spaces and asset types. We are on the ideal timing and we have the perfect team to lead this movement in agribusiness.”</p>

<div class="bcontainer bcontainer_1">
<p id="speakable-summary">Transit planning app Moovit is now featuring Bird&#8217;s shared e-scooters and e-bikes in its app. As of Thursday, Moovit users in 65 cities across 12 countries — including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — will be able to locate nearby Bird vehicles in real time, gauge how long it will take to walk there and see the battery range of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Moovit says it plans to open the Bird integration to U.S. cities in the near future but didn&#8217;t specify when.</p>
<p>Bird has around 20 mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) integrations, including with smaller entities like myCicero in Italy and Skipr in Belgium and France, with planned integration with Germany&#8217;s Jelbi. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/bird-is-the-latest-operator-to-integrate-its-e-scooters-and-e-bikes-with-google-maps/'">recently also integrated with Google Maps</a>, alongside competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">Spin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">Lime</a>, both of which are already featured in the Moovit app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bird&#8217;s vehicles can be found in over 300 cities globally, and the company is always looking for ways to increase its reach. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">the operator launched a &#8220;Smart Bikeshare&#8221; platform</a> that allows local shared e-bike and e-moped providers and transit apps to feature their vehicles on the Bird app. As micromobility increasingly becomes an integral part of the transport ecosystem, these types of cross-platform integrations are bound to continue surfacing.</p>
<p>Moovit, which says it has served over 1 billion urban users in over 1,500 cities across 112 countries, has about 300 mobility providers integrated into its app, including Tier, Voi, Beam, Helbiz, Beryl, Zwings, Revel and many more, according to the company. As part of the integration, Bird and Moovit plan to collaborate on urban mobility research in these regions to gain local perspectives on mobility trends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moovit&#8217;s goal is to simplify urban mobility around the world and make it more efficient, accessible and sustainable,&#8221; Sharon Kaslassi, global corporate communications manager at Moovit, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Integrating private sector companies such as Bird and Lime help support that goal by encouraging riders toward car-free, multimodal trips. It also provides people returning to their pre-COVID routines with easily accessible first- and last-mile options to choose from for more hassle-free travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit wants to be a true MaaS platform and that means offering more forms of alternative transport. Aside from micromobility integrations, Moovit On-Demand, the company&#8217;s shared mobility planning feature, is integrated into the Moovit consumer app in certain regions. Last November, Moovit partnered with SMART, a dial-a-ride transport operator outside Detroit, to modernize its service and reduce wait times. Now, locals can use the Moovit app to book those on-demand transit rides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moovit also powers a white label app for transport agencies and cities that want to offer on-demand shared mobility. Just this year, Australian bus provider Ventura launched a new on-demand service and app to Melbourne residents, called FlexiRide, which is powered by Moovit On-Demand, and two Scottish regions, the <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-partnership-scottish-borders-council/">Scottish Borders</a> and <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-aberdeenshire-council-partnership/">Aberdeenshire</a>, also launched similar services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public and shared transportation is the backbone of society, and Moovit&#8217;s goals are to harness the power of MaaS, driven by big data, to create a world with simpler, more intuitive ways of accessing and consuming transportation,&#8221; said Kaslassi. &#8220;Moovit aims to reduce congestion, grow ridership and increase mobility efficiency by guiding people in getting around using any mode of transport (except for using private vehicles).&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit can be downloaded on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moovit-train-bus-times/id498477945">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fat tire e-bike manufacturer Rad Power Bikes just raised another $154 million. The Series D raise from existing investors, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $329 million, comes just eight months after Rad raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">$150 million.</a> The Seattle-based startup aims to use the funds to boost investments in product and technology innovation and beef out its distribution network, according to founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>Rad’s latest round is led by institutional investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with investments from funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Vulcan Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP and The Rise Fund, TPG&#8217;s multisector global impact investing strategy.</p>
<p>“I think the fact that some of the world’s most respected investors are doubling down just shows this competence in our business, both with the scale advantage that we have and also just the overall potential in the e-bike market,” Radenbaugh told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s Rad’s scale that the company is leaning on now in order to really become a powerhouse. Rad Power has launched dozens of new bike accessories and multiple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rad-power-bikes-reveals-more-user-friendly-next-gen-e-bike-radrover-6-plus-for-1999/">new e-bikes</a> this year, despite the supply chain shortages that have caused delays on product releases across industries. That’s in part due to the company’s diversified and dedicated supply chain. Rad has multiple source suppliers and manufacturing partners across continents to fall back on and has even started chartering its own vessels to ensure bikes are delivered, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/rad-power-bikes-founder-mike-randenbaugh-on-fueling-the-e-bike-revolution/">Radenbaugh told TechCrunch in a previous interview</a>.</p>
<p>Rad has also opened up multiple distribution centers this year, and by the end of the year, expects to triple its capacity to deliver bikes and accessories to customers within five days. The plan is to keep that momentum going into next year by adding more distribution centers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Europe in order to strengthen its logistics and fulfillment capabilities.</p>
<p>“I think of our business more like a solutions business, so it’s also our buy online experience and pickup in store experience, our integrations with our retail stores and mobile service centers and making all that a seamless customer experience,” said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>The company says it will triple the number of physical locations of mobile service and retail stores by the end of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our business has been largely break-even or profitable, and it kind of fluctuates around break-even, so this is all growth capital,” said Radenbaugh. “It&#8217;s all just designed to flow into expansion of our operations, customer service and innovation.”</p>
<p>For Radenbaugh, the guy who started building e-bikes at 15 years old, expanding Rad Power Bikes isn’t just about growing his business. It’s about making green transportation more accessible. It’s about getting people out of their cars and back outside.</p>
<p>“E-bikes are really the solution to a lot of our toughest challenges for the environment, and it’s the direct reason why customers are picking them up,” he said. “It could be teens and professionals commuting to school or work, running errands, retirees reliving the joy of riding again, commercial last-mile customers. These people are buying the product because it’s a better tool for everyday life and mobility, but there’s the environmental side, too, which gets our investor base really energized around the business.”</p>
<p>Rad Power Bikes has 350,000 customers, so it has plenty of data on how people use its vehicles. The company found that more than 70% of customers ride their bikes more than several times per week. In addition, Rad’s number one acquisition channel is word of mouth and repeat customers.</p>
<p>“The richness of our data is starting to show something bigger happening here, a kind of consumer-led movement by passionate, high-use customers,” said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>These are heartening statistics because they signal a shift in modes of transportation that we’re starting to see mirrored in the way cities look at cycling infrastructure. Radenbaugh said the company initially built powerful utilitarian bikes with throttles, big batteries and fat tires in large part to overcome poor infrastructure. Now as the company tries to become a brand that is synonymous with the future of mobility, it’s doubling down on government affairs and lobbying for better accessibility.</p>
<p>“We believe that as an industry leader, Rad Power Bikes has a compelling market opportunity to fulfill the potential of e-bikes as an effective transportation and mobility solution globally,” said Andrew Davis, director of private investments at T. Rowe Price, in a statement. “In our view, they have the management team, technology strength and operational expertise to succeed over the long term and to play an important role in addressing the world’s current and future climate challenges.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based mobile keyboard software maker, <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/">Fleksy</a>, has bagged a $1.6 million Series A to cement a pivot to b2b for its white-label SDK for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>The round is led by Spanish asset management firm, Inveready, with follow on funding from some of the startup&#8217;s existing investors: SOSV and Simile Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The Series A brings the team&#8217;s total raised to date to just under $3M (€2.5M) since the business was founded back in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The AI keyboard maker has been a long time player in the third party smartphone keyboard space, initially developing a productivity-focused keyboard called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/thingthing-keyboard/">ThingThing</a> &#8212; before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/fleksy-keyboard-to-get-major-reboot-under-thingthing-dev-team/">acquiring the assets of better known US-based custom keyboard Fleksy</a> (which had gone into stasis after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">dev team got acquired by Pinterest</a>) and making developing Fleksy the full focus.</p>
<p>However monetizing in the consumer custom keyboard space is tough going, with features like next word prediction and swipe inputting now baked into native smartphone keyboards, reducing the value of a third party add-on.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Apple and Google also throw their weight around in peculiar ways. (See, for eg, the flaky implementation of third party keyboards on iOS which helps dissuade users from switching away from Apple&#8217;s native keyboard. Or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/googles-play-store-is-giving-an-age-rating-finger-to-fleksy-a-gboard-rival/">this unfun thing Google&#8217;s Play Store did for a while</a>.)</p>
<p>So, last year, Fleksy rolled out an SDK &#8212; licensing its keyboard tech to other app makers and businesses who want powerfully predictive, context-specific, custom AI keyboard software which they can tint, brand and adapt in all sorts of ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The keyboard SDK could also be used by third parties to learn more about their users and/or seek to drive their own sales.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aBDN5XtW6E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/">Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/embed/#?secret=aBDN5XtW6E" data-secret="aBDN5XtW6E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among potential features which clients can implement via the SDK that it lists on its <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">website</a> are the ability to bake context-specific advertising into the keyboard (aka, &#8220;hyper-contextually suggest products and services or set triggers to show your brand in any app at the opportune moment&#8221;); and a forthcoming CRM feature that Fleksy says will &#8220;enable shops to send marketing materials, invoices, updates, tasks, and even collect payment from the keyboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security focused features are also touted as &#8220;coming soon&#8221; &#8212; with custom tweaks that it says could be used to &#8220;prevent data leaks and sensitive information from getting out, monitor at-risk employees, Secure messages, prevent fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this b2b play, Fleksy continues playing in the consumer space &#8212; where it strongly emphasizes user privacy as a differentiator for its software vs alternatives like Google&#8217;s Gboard (which sends users&#8217; search data to Google) &#8212; and most recently it was trying to entice consumers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fleksy-adds-an-art-marketplace-to-spice-up-its-keyboard-app/">art keyboards</a>.</p>
<p>But its center of gravity has clearly shifted to b2b. Hence foregrounding &#8216;Fleksy for Business&#8217; branding on its website, which has also had a deeptech aesthetic design makeover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.app.fleksy.com/fleksy-product">consumer keyboard</a> will still stick around, though &#8212; for the hardcore fans and, doubtless, as a useful showcase/testbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumer is hard when the giants don&#8217;t compete equally. See Apple mess and Google mess around that. So we found our profitable niche: Helping others build an outstanding keyboard experience and beyond, via license fees,&#8221; says Fleksy&#8217;s CEO Olivier Plante, who was also CEO and co-founder of ThingThing. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to build what we have built, so it&#8217;s now a no brainer for these digital companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK gives all the tools that a company needs to thrive in their own rationale,&#8221; he also tells us when we raise the (privacy) question of how third parties might seek to use its keyboard tech to data-mine their own users. &#8220;Fleksy plays a technological role here only. We are not associated with a client&#8217;s own privacy stance.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he adds: &#8220;To be clear, Fleksy Consumer Apps will always be private &#8212; we don&#8217;t change our rationale there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fleksy says it now has &#8220;dozens&#8221; of companies licensing its tech &#8212; and touts 50 more in its &#8220;pipeline&#8221;. It also says revenue for its SDK business has grown 10x in a year.</p>
<p>This uplift explains the relatively modest size of the Series A, per Plante.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only needed this because we are generating quite a lot of money at the moment,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, adding that the reason for raising a Series A now is to &#8220;expand faster&#8221;.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for growth, hiring (to build out its 13-strong team) and to expand its portfolio of clients.</p>
<p>Fleksy&#8217;s best markets for licensing the keyboard tech to currently are the US and Europe but Plante says it has customers all over the world.</p>
<p>The SDK is also attracting a broad mix of customers &#8212; from digital health and fintech to gaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many leads looking for a keyboard experience &#8212; as you can see under /<a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">solutions</a>/ on the website &#8212; these industries &#8212; and even more will all be powered by Fleksy tech,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have clients from all types with different needs and because we have built everything in-house &#8212; no third party&#8217;s black-box &#8212; we are able to modify everything for them. Which no other company can provide today. So companies in digital health for example have a profitable company to partner with who has full control over its tech stack,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK can be modified in many ways: From the layout, dictionary all the way to the core engines that power our autocorrect, predictions, sentiment and more. It&#8217;s what makes us the right choice but, as you know, the vision is much larger &#8212; &#8216;Typing on a screen will be typing on Fleksy&#8217; in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the Series A funding round, Inveready&#8217;s Ignacio Fonts is joining Fleksy&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Fonts said: “We are thrilled to join the <span class="il">Fleksy</span> team, which has been able to conquer a worldwide leadership position in keyboard technology, one of the control points of personal computing (phone, mobile, desktops) devices. This round will help them accelerate the development of a very compelling roadmap that will unveil to users new ways to interact with their devices and will provide companies new insights about their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s world is run on data, and the amount of it that is being produced, managed and used to power services is growing by the minute &#8212; to the tune of some 79 zettabytes this year, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one estimate</a>. Today, a company called <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yugabyte</a>, which has built an open-source distributed SQL database model to help handle all that volume, is announcing that it has raised $188 million at a valuation of over $1.3 billion &#8212; a big round of funding and big valuation that underscore the market demand for better tools, and the demand that Yugabyte is in particular is seeing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C is being led by <span class="s1">Sapphire Ventures</span>, with <span class="s1">Alkeon Capital </span>and <span class="s1">Meritech Capital</span>, <span class="s1">Wells Fargo Strategic Capital</span>, and previous backers <span class="s1">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span>, <span class="s1">8VC</span>, <span class="s1">Dell Technologies Capital</span>, and <span class="s1">Wipro Ventures</span>, all also participating, among other unnamed backers. It was only seven months ago that the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/yugabyte-announces-48m-series-c-as-cloud-native-database-makes-enterprise-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed its Series B round</a> (which totaled $78 million).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo is one of Yugabyte&#8217;s key commercial customers, alongside Kroger, Hudson River Trading, Plume and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other organizations</a> that handle large amounts of data in their businesses, and in particular are looking for SQL-based solutions that can be used across multi-cloud, heterogeneous environments. The company tells me it is approaching 50 commercial customers currently. There are more using its open-source, free version, and it says that some 1,200 organizations &#8220;have signed up for&#8221; its fully-managed solution, Yugabyte Cloud, since its beta launch last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225620" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re at an inflection point in enterprise IT at the moment, where a years-long trend of organizations gradually migrating to the cloud &#8212; and in particular more complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments &#8212; has seen a massive acceleration, in large part due to Covid-19. The pandemic precipitated a bigger shift to companies producing more data internally due to working in more remote and distributed environments, in many cases using more cloud-based digital tools to do so; and it also led to a huge surge in the world at large using more digital services. The knock-on effect is a much greater need among organizations for better database solutions to manage and work with that data, but also the realities, and complexities, of how it exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises are really only just starting to hit critical mass of workloads,&#8221; Bill Cook, Yugabyte&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview, added that those enterprises also are balancing that with some key priorities: &#8220;They are thinking a lot about infrastructure, and they don’t want to get locked into a particular cloud provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yugabyte&#8217;s pitch is that it addresses that challenge with a framework that can scale easily and securely as needed. It currently provides three SQL products to the market covering different use cases: YugabyteDB, its free, open source distributed SQL database; Yugabyte Platform, its self-managed cloud database-as-a-service product; and Yugabyte Cloud, the fully-managed cloud DBaaS launched just in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005390/en/Yugabyte-Delivers-Effortless-Distributed-SQL-With-Cloud-Database-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a>.</p>
<p>Yugabyte itself was borne out of first-hand experience of how other systems didn&#8217;t work as well. The startup&#8217;s founders &#8212; Kannan Muthukkaruppan (president), Karthik Ranganathan (CTO) and Mikhail Bautin (software architect) originally worked together at Facebook. There, they built the NoSQL database that powered Messenger, where they came away realising some of the shortcomings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially very taken with the NoSQL &#8220;market success, we then realized the limitations of it,&#8221; said Ranganathan, who is Yubabyte&#8217;s CTO. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different to deal with these databases in production.&#8221; Specifically, as Cook described it, trends in microservices, containerization, services distribution, open source and API usage (and thus high latency and availability), are best addressed not through NoSQL but a distributed SQL database.</p>
<p>Jai Das, the president of Sapphire who is joining the board with is round, said that this is also what motivated him to lead this round.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;There hasn’t been any SQL innovation since MySQL,&#8221; he said, in particular to address the fact that many of the largest entprises now work with distributed databases, either because they have opted to do so, or they are required to because of regulatory demands or simply because that is how their networks and systems have evolved. Das believes that SQL will be at the heart of how databases will continue to evolve. &#8220;It is the lingua franca of how all applications will be built in the back end, and Yugabyte is the next generation.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Co-founder and CEO Grant Lee refers to building content in Gamma like “choosing your own adventure.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grant Lee has been living in slide decks for most of his career, but it wasn’t until he was doing some advisory work last year that relied heavily on slides that he aimed to reimagine the format.</p>
<p>“Slides were built for a different era of work,” he told TechCrunch. “They were more of a visual aid. You had to have a presenter because they have little standalone power without the person.”</p>
<p>Previously, people would print off slides or watch the presentation together on one screen, but the overall problem of people sharing and communicating their work has existed for a long time. Lee said. Slides have been around for over 30 years, and now everyone has their own screen.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So Lee and his co-founders, James Fox and Jon Noronha, all former Optimizely employees (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">Optimizely was acquired by Episerver in 2020</a>), started <a href="https://gamma.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamma</a>, a software that enables users to build stacks of cards that fit a brand’s aesthetic and prioritize design by linking different bits of content, like videos and embeddable forms that can be filled out in real time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225076" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225076" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225076 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg" alt="Gamma" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225076" class="wp-caption-text">The Gamma team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gamma</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Gamma was to create something that still feels familiar to the traditional slide, but that also “unlocks a whole new set of super power,” Lee said. He refers to building content in Gamma like “choosing your own adventure,” and the content can be dragged, dropped uploaded and fit into the cards. And though the presenter is guiding the conversation, watchers can explore the content themselves and then go back to following the presentation.</p>
<p>The company was founded last November, launched in private beta in August and is now announcing $7 million in seed funding led by Accel. Other participants in the round include Zoom CEO Eric Yuan; former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner; founders at Airtable, Patreon, Segment, Honey and Optimizely; and early-stage funds including Script Capital, South Park Commons, LocalGlobe, Afore and Hustle Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we came out of stealth in August, we were talking to Accel and thought they were the right partner,” Lee said. “Investing in a new medium can be difficult, but we were excited about crafting the right building blocks. The new funding will allow us to build out the team and the product, and it will help having the right partner.”</p>
<p>Gamma is now out of private beta and Lee said there are thousands of people on the waitlist to be onboarded. It is too early to discuss growth metrics, due to the company not yet having paying customers, but there will be some paid plans down the road, he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new funding will accelerate the company’s goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish food tech company <a href="https://nicks.com/">N!CK’S</a> is taking on the world, one healthy ice cream pint at a time.</p>
<p>The company on Thursday announced $100 million Series C funding toward creating additional healthy snacks and ice cream products that have a proprietary blend of sweeteners and ingredients, but with a fraction of the calories and no added sugar.</p>
<p>Kinnevik, Ambrosia and Temasek co-led the round and were joined by Gullspang. The latest funding gives the company $160 million in total investments, Carlos Altschul, N!CK’S CEO North America, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>N!CK’S got started in 2017 in Europe when founder and head of R&amp;D Niclas Luthman’s mother was diagnosed as a diabetic, and Luthman diagnosed as pre-diabetic, according to Altschul.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“He recognized that there was not a lot of food science bringing better-for-you solutions to the space,” he added. “He found that it was easier to change the food versus change the way we eat.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the company makes ice cream, snack bars and confectionery products. However, Altschul says N!CK’S is a snacking brand that is “a platform for changing culture.” The innovation and ingredients, all rooted in the company&#8217;s R&amp;D, are what differentiates the company from its competitors, he added.</p>
<p>The company has been busy over the past two years. At the end of 2019, N!CK’S entered the United States with ice cream and is now leading in velocity per store in that category, he added. It also launched a vegan dairy line featuring Perfect Day’s proprietary animal-free dairy proteins and plant-based alternative fat.</p>
<p>Its direct-to-consumer business launched in 2020 and has remained at the top of the DTC ice cream delivery space since July, Altschul said. This year, the company launched a line of Keto protein bars, starting on its direct-to-consumer and Amazon channels, with plans to expand into retail stores by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, N!CK’S expanded from 4,500 U.S. stores to 6,700, and expanded in the U.K. through a partnership with WHSmith.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yamo scores €10.1M Series A to offer healthier food choices for young children&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/yamo/embed/#?secret=1Lrsjci0Jc" data-secret="1Lrsjci0Jc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding will accelerate the company’s goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe, hiring additional talent, marketing and making investments in R&amp;D so that it can launch new products.</p>
<p>Magnus Jakobson, investment director at Kinnevik, said he has been investing in the food space for a few years and says the industry is attractive due to the multiple tailwinds of sustainability and health happening at the moment, which is driving demand and the upstream ability to build brands.</p>
<p>He considers it “an exciting point in time,” that the traction N!CK’S has shown to date “is impressive,” especially having done it on its own initially, and that strategy has now attracted other food technology partners.</p>
<p>“How people live and consume food is changing and is what is enabling new brands to be built,” Jakobson said. “Companies like Oatly, Beyond and Impossible started the industry, but we have seen more breakouts in technology and new ways of reaching consumers with standalone brands. N!CK’S is a super exciting one, and even in the early days of the industry, is showing promise.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia could be next to mandate a choice screen in a bid to break Google&#8217;s dominance of the search market.</p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is recommending it is given the power to &#8220;mandate, develop and implement a mandatory choice screen to improve competition and consumer choice in the supply of search engine services in Australia&#8221;.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/DPB%20-%20DPSI%20-%20September%202021%20-%20Full%20Report%20-%2030%20September%202021%20%283%29_1.pdf">new report</a> by the country&#8217;s competition watchdog concludes that interventions are needed to boost competition in the local search engine market and address harms flowing from Google&#8217;s circa 94% marketshare of search in Australia, such as barriers to entry for other competitors and the risk of lower quality services with what it dubs &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/">undesirable features</a>&#8221; &#8212; like more sponsored content vs organic search results&#8230;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225600" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fv0a873HNU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/">Google&#8217;s latest user-hostile design change makes ads and search results look identical</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s latest user-hostile design change makes ads and search results look identical&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/embed/#?secret=Fv0a873HNU" data-secret="Fv0a873HNU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s grip on the local search market is also hampering new business models emerging &#8212; such as subscription options that don&#8217;t rely on ads (and data-mining users) to monetize Internet search.</p>
<p>The report gives the example of <a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>, a new, subscription-based search engine &#8212; which advertises itself as &#8220;the only ad-free private search engine&#8221; &#8212; and (unlike Google most other search engines) has no ads or affiliate links in search results &#8212;  thereby offering &#8220;a different value proposition that consumers may desire&#8221;, in the regulator&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s foreclosure of key search access points through the arrangements discussed in this Report limits the ability of these businesses to grow, and consumers’ exposure to new and potentially attractive business models,&#8221; the ACCC concludes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To tackle such problems, the regulator wants to be able to implement a search choice screen on Android devices which will provide users with a selection of options vs Google&#8217;s &#8220;predetermined default&#8221; &#8212; with the regulator saying that such a mechanism &#8220;can improve the ability of rival search engines to reach consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the ACCC also wants to be responsible for developing the criteria around the application of a choice screen to specified service providers &#8212; which its report notes should be &#8220;linked to the provider’s market power and/or strategic position&#8221;.</p>
<p>That looks like a key qualification given Google has been offering a search choice screen in the European Union to users of Android smartphones for around three years &#8212; and there has been no notable shift in its regional dominance of search.</p>
<p>That can be blamed on the EU leaving it up to Google to determine how to &#8216;remedy&#8217; the $5BN &#8216;cease &amp; desist&#8217; antitrust enforcement it issued against Google over Android back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>Google responded by adding a &#8216;choice&#8217; screen of its own devising in the EU &#8212; which search rivals quickly decried.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GX85JsaBft"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/google-rivals-call-on-eu-to-set-rules-for-search-engine-preference-menus/">Google rivals call on EU to set rules for search engine preference menus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google rivals call on EU to set rules for search engine preference menus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/google-rivals-call-on-eu-to-set-rules-for-search-engine-preference-menus/embed/#?secret=GX85JsaBft" data-secret="GX85JsaBft" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They were especially incensed about a sealed bid auction model Google opted for &#8212; selling slots on the choice screen to rivals, without needing to pay to continue displaying its own search engine on the very same screen of course.</p>
<p>This resulted in Android choice screens that were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/europes-android-choice-screen-keeps-burying-better-options/">filled with an uninspiring parade of Google-style ad-targeting wannabies</a> or else Google itself as the offered &#8216;choice&#8217; &#8212; almost entirely excluding pro-privacy or not-for-profit alternatives who were unable to outbid data-mining rivals.</p>
<p>The entirely predictable result was that Google has maintained its iron grip on Europe&#8217;s search market. And laughed all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>Eventually the European Commission did step in &#8212; and, this summer year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/#:~:text=EU%20pressure%20%7C%20TechCrunch-,Google%20ditches%20pay-to-play%20Android%20search%20choice%20auction%20for,free%20version%20after%20EU%20pressure&amp;text=Google%20is%20ditching%20a%20massively,be%20able%20to%20freely%20participate.">Google announced it would drop the auction model</a> and instead let search rivals appear for free.</p>
<p>However alternative search engines, such as the non-tracking DuckDuckGo, remain highly critical of remedy, arguing that for a choice screen to truly work regulators must tackle the whole suite of damaging defaults Google applies to lock users to its products.</p>
<p>The EU implementation, for example, only applies to new Android devices (and not also to Chrome), and only on set-up or factory reboot of a device. DuckDuckGo&#8217;s counter suggestion is that regulators must make search competition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">a single click away</a> at all times.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DuckDuckGo presses the case for true &#8216;one-click&#8217; search competition on Android&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/embed/#?secret=erIsR7Kx5z" data-secret="erIsR7Kx5z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Australia&#8217;s watchdog appears aware of such pitfalls &#8212; writing: &#8220;The development of a choice screen and its implementation should be subject to detailed consultation with industry participants and user testing, and there should be careful consideration of its interaction with other measures proposed in this Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, it&#8217;s leaning towards the choice screen applying to both new and <em>existing</em> Android mobile devices &#8212; which is immediately a considerably broader application than Google chose to apply in the EU (giving itself a free pass to keep applying its damaging defaults on the hundreds of millions of already in-play Androids).</p>
<p>The ACCC also stipulates that an Australian Android choice screen should be free for search engines to participate in. So the lesson of Google&#8217;s self-serving EU auction model has clearly trickled down under.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s watchdog also wants wider powers to be able to effectively tackle the lack of competition in search &#8212; suggesting it will need measures to restrict a provider (&#8220;which meets pre-defined criteria&#8221;) from tying or bundling search services with other goods or services; and perhaps also limit the ability of a provider to pay for certain default positions.</p>
<p>The report also floats the idea of &#8220;potentially mandating access to specified datasets for rival non-dominant search engines&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulator suggests rivals may need access to Google&#8217;s click-and-query data &#8212; &#8220;and potentially other datasets&#8221; &#8212; though it adds that this would need to be subject to &#8220;extensive consideration of privacy impacts, and careful design and ongoing monitoring to ensure there are no adverse impacts on consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are a number of factors that contribute to the quality of a search engine, click-and-query data is a critical input,&#8221; the report goes on. &#8220;In limiting rivals’ ability to reach consumers at scale, Google has ensured it maintains access to an unrivalled dataset, allowing it to continuously improve the quality of its search results in a way that its competitors cannot, and reducing the extent to which rivals are able to scale and compete against Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has flow on effects for the ability of rival search engines to monetise their services, effectively self-reinforcing Google’s dominance in search. Google’s position means it can offer greater sums to suppliers of browsers and OEMs to be the default search engine. Rivals are thereby foreclosed from accessing users and the necessary click-and-query data to improve their search engine service, further raising barriers to entry and expansion, and extending and entrenching Google’s dominance in search.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the ACCC is considering some meaty interventions against Google&#8217;s dominance of search, actual action appears some way off &#8212; with a fifth interim report, that&#8217;s not due until September 2022, set to consider a framework for the proposed rules and powers, along with a broader assessment of the need for ex-ante regulation for digital platforms &#8212; &#8220;to address common competition and consumer concerns we have identified across digital platform markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reports are part of work ordered by the Australian government last year &#8212; when it instructed the regulator to conduct an <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platform-services-inquiry-2020-2025">inquiry into digital markets</a> and report back every six months. However the final report is not due until March 2025.</p>
<p>The EU of course has already proposed ex ante rules to tackle platform giants, under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which was presented at the end of last year. Though is likely years off being adopted.</p>
<p>The UK is also working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">a competition reform</a> that will give regulators pre-emptive powers over tech giants who are deemed to have strategic market power. But, again, a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a> is pending a suite of legislative powers.</p>
<p>While Germany &#8212; which is ahead of the pack &#8212; updated its digital regulations at the start of this year, bringing in ex ante powers to tackle platforms. Its competition watchdog, the FCO, is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">assessing</a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">market</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">power</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">a number of tech giants</a> to determine how it might intervene to support competition.</p>
<p>Germany suite of probes includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">a close look at Google&#8217;s News Showcase product</a>, through which the tech giant licensed news publishers&#8217; content by inking closed door commercial deals which risk playing large publishers off against smaller ones, among other competition concerns.</p>
<p>Australia has already passed legislation in this area &#8212; putting a news bargaining code into legislation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">back in February</a> that applies to both Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the ACCC report, Google sent us this statement attributed to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“People use Google Search because it’s helpful, not because they have to and its popularity is based on quality that’s built on two decades of innovation. Android gives people choice by allowing them to customise their device &#8212; from the apps they download, to the default services for those apps. Preinstallation benefits users by making it easier for them to use services quickly and easily. We are continuing to review the report and look forward to discussing it with the ACCC and Government.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">Dragos</a> has raised $200 million in Series D funding at a valuation of $1.7 billion. The investment, which Dragos says is also the largest funding round achieved by an industrial cybersecurity firm, was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies and BlackRock.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to accelerate the company’s global expansion and support customers in key growth markets including electric, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, water, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>“We weren’t trying to raise the Series D round,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;What ended up happening was because people realized how important operational technology is, and you’ve got the president <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-further-actions-to-protect-u-s-critical-infrastructure/">talking about it</a>, the investment community woke up to the opportunity.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dragos was founded in 2016 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dragos-premium-people-profits/">detect and respond to threats</a> facing industrial control systems (ICS), the devices key to the continued operations of power plants, water systems, and other critical infrastructure.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The company’s latest investment — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">which follows a $110 million in Series C round in December last year</a> — comes at a time of explosive growth for industrial cybersecurity, and a rise in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. In May and June this year, ransomware attacks targeted Colonial Pipeline and the IT network of meat maker JBS, forcing the companies to shut down their industrial operations.</p>
<p>Lee said it&#8217;s forcing organizations to reassess the security of their operational technology, or OT.</p>
<p>“All these CEOs and board directors have never not understood that they make money out of OT, but when the pandemic happened, they&#8217;re going, ‘Holy crap, we need to do a lot more&#8217;,&#8221; said Lee. “That’s been driving momentum in a way we couldn’t have predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dragos said it saw year-on-year growth of 100% in platform recurring revenue, as well as success on the national security front, fueled by its unique Neighborhood Keeper technology, a visibility solution that shares ICS threat intelligence across industries and geographic regions.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen a giant policy shift with the Biden administration to call out the necessity of ICS,&#8221; Lee says.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for Dragos? Lee tells TechCrunch that the company&#8217;s intention is to IPO, though he said it&#8217;s by no means an immediate priority for the company.</p>
<p>“What’s right for our customers is to stay long-term independent, and I don’t see how anything other than an IPO once you’ve taken venture capital keeps you independent,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We’ve had all the multi-billion dollar acquisition offers along the way, but if my son is going to have lights and water when he grows up, it’s going to be based on us being independent long term.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two months into 2021, South African fintech Stitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">came out of stealth</a> and raised $4 million in seed funding, allowing it to begin to make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inroads into Nigeria some months ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Stitch formally announced the expansion into Nigeria and a seed extension of $2 million to go with it; the total seed investment now stands at $6 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in the round include existing backers Raba, Firstminute Capital, CRE, Village Global, 500 Fintech, Future Africa, and Norrsken. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executives at global fintechs, participated as well. They include Tom Blomfield, co-founder of Monzo and GoCardless; Matt Robinson, co-founder of GoCardless; Emilie Choi, president and COO of Coinbase; and Charlie Delingpole, founder of ComplyAdvantage.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Stitch launched the typical Plaid playbook used globally by fintech infrastructure players: a data product to help developers and fintechs connect their applications to users’ financial accounts. These businesses can then access their identities, accounts, transaction history and balances with users’ consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Stitch had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched from stealth, it felt too early for the company to divulge how many financial accounts it had connected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months in, the company still isn’t enthused about sharing those numbers, though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has been testing a payments product and has made significant progress there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African fintechs most times rely on card payments, and despite the infrastructure provided by the likes of Yoco, Flutterwave and Paystack, there are still issues around chargeback fees and fraud costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, Stitch decided to address these issues and help businesses process payments better by soft launching its pay-by-bank feature. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once you make the user experience even more frictionless for pay-by-bank, and as tokenizable as card, the choice to use this method over others [particularly for fintechs] is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> straightforward,” <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/kiaan-pillay-887979106">Kiaan Pillay</a>, the co-founder and CEO of Stitch, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillay says that within six months of its soft launch in South Africa, the company has seen more than 50% month-on-month growth in customer and payments volume across all solutions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, Stitch has also been testing its payments product instead of its primary data product.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, the company had a more compelling use case of the payments product in Nigeria after speaking to over 40 fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s why: Nigeria has an efficient instant bank settlement system and the option to pay via bank in various fintech applications is relatively standard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is that when customers try to pay via their mobile or internet banking app, they must </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use their mobile bank application to complete the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Stitch, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, users do not need to go through that hassle and can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once-off, recurring and user-not-present bank transfers, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opportunity is ripe,” said Pillay, who co-founded Stitch with</span><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/ncthbrt"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Cuthbert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/priyen-pillay"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Priyen Pillay.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more and more API fintechs are recognizing that paying via credit card interchange comes with a high fee when converting customers onto their platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month alone, we’ve seen our inbound requests increase five- to tenfold here in South Africa, and customers are integrating us in Nigeria even as we were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still in soft launch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now fully live in South Africa and Nigeria, Stitch says it is on track to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $10 million in monthly payments by the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of its clients include Chipper Cash, Paystack, Franc, Sanlam, Yoco and Flexclub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When open banking startups came into the African fintech scene last year, it seemed there was a race to become Africa’s Plaid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, each player has settled in their respective markets &#8212; Pngme in Kenya and Nigeria; Mono in Nigeria and Ghana; Okra in Nigeria, with beta in South Africa and Kenya; and Stitch in South Africa and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear how important Nigeria is as a market for these startups. So how does Stitch plan to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers in a market where other competitors offer the same payments product?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a start, we are offering Nigerian businesses who intend to use Stitch free access to the product until the end of 2021,” <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/benjamindada">Benjamin Dada</a>, the country manager of Stitch Nigeria, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dada will spearhead Stitch’s operations in Nigeria. Before joining the company, he was the founder and editor-at-large at Nigerian tech publication <a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/">Benjamindada.com</a>. The country manager’s fintech experience comes from working at partnerships for Eyowo, a Nigerian digital bank and a brief stint at Tiger Global-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dada believes the market is big enough to accommodate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players, he says the team will try to edge others by developing “inclusive and sustainable” pricing for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They will not only be achieving cost savings by accepting account payments, but they can now earn a little more for each payment they accept via Stitch,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the company intends to do that is murky for now. What is clear, though, is that the company plans to launch its data solution by the end of November</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed extension will be integral to that and to seeing more hires join Dada and his team in Lagos, Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blomfield said in a statement that he backed Stitch because he sees the company playing a crucial role in building the infrastructure to enable exponential growth for digital finance companies in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see a lot of potential in African markets, where the wave of digital finance innovation is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning to gain momentum, and the Stitch team is getting in at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">precisely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right time. The team is one of the best I’ve seen globally, and I’m excited to see them continue to grow in Nigeria and beyond.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonian on-demand transport firm <a href="https://bolt.eu/">Bolt</a> is set to roll out electric taxi options in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt’s plan follows the introduction of a ‘green category’ – which lets riders hail an electric or a hybrid vehicle. This comes as the company expands its services to environmentally friendly modes of transport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are looking to roll out a green taxi category in South Africa in the next few months, and plan to roll out green categories in other African markets,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt’s regional director for Africa and Middle East, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Partridge.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company already offers a green option in Kenya, where it also runs e-bike food delivery. It also plans to launch e-mobility options for food delivery in its other markets across East Africa, including Uganda and Tanzania. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by Markus Villig, the tech firm, which has operations in 45 countries &#8211; including seven in Africa &#8211; runs a gamut of services comprising ride-hailing, car, scooter and bike rentals, food delivery, and recently grocery delivery, fashioning itself as a transport and deliveries company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In East Africa we see a lot of potential on the motorbike side, and especially for delivery. We plan to invest more in this direction as it also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves to eliminate the challenges associated with constantly fluctuating fuel prices, currently the most significant operating cost for our couriers,” said Partridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities for electric mobility are said to be huge, but a majority of countries lack the necessary infrastructure to support their adoption, says a UNEP</span><a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/25188/EMOB_OpportunitiesChallenges.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of recharging infrastructure, low grid power connectivity, and generally expensive e-vehicles remain hindrances to the adoption of electric transportation options in many African countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transition to electric power would offer countries in sub-Saharan Africa a range of gains, including affordable transport and a reduction in emissions, with fossil-fuel vehicles contributing 12% of the region’s total emissions, according to the</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00721-7.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SSA Nature Sustainability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt is planning arrangements with banking institutions in its markets in Africa to help its drivers access credit for purchasing electric vehicles, exploring other options away from its current scheme with leasing companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The purchase cost and import duties are often high, thereby deterring ownership. We are exploring a number of vehicle financing partnerships in Kenya and South Africa for electric cars and bikes, which would help make it easier for drivers to get access to, and eventually own, electric vehicles,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s plan to expand its offering across the continent comes in the wake of growing competition from companies such as Uber, which is currently testing a carpooling service in Nairobi, with plans to roll it out in Ghana and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt recently launched the food delivery service in Nigeria, and also expanded its reach in South Africa by rolling out the service in Johannesburg after introducing it in Cape Town last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes in the wake of the company’s recent $696 million (€600M) funding round that the tech firm said will go into growing the new grocery delivery service, Bolt Market, as well as in expanding its other transport and delivery services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital, Tekne Capital, and Ghisallo, G Squared, D1 Capital, and Naya Capital are some of the investors that participated in the funding round that increased its valuation to €4 billion. The new funding came after the International Finance Corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/">injected $24 million </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/">(€20)</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/"> into the business at the beginning of the year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the services it is looking to grow is Bolt Drive, the car rental service launched early this year to offer different choices including compact, mid-size, electric, premium, SUV, and van. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is currently available in Estonia’s capital Tallin with plans to roll it out in other Europe and Africa markets. Bolt Drive adds to the micro-mobility options – scooters and e-bikes – that the company introduced in line with its goal of availing to the masses, more budget environmentally friendly transport solutions. The e-mobility service is available in over 100 cities across Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to scale up our operations for the benefit of our customers.  Our core business is to provide reliable, safe and affordable transportation services to everyone and we are excited to make travel easier and quicker in many cities across the continent,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partridge.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s fairly simply: Softwood grows a lot faster &#8211; in ‘sustainable’ forests &#8211; than hardwood. The latter is often found in bio-diverse old-growth forests like, um, the Amazon. So if you could make softwood behave like hardwood, you’d not only access more sustainable wood for construction, you’d also protect hardwood forests from destruction. Plus, you save a lof of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>That’s the reasoning behind what <a href="https://us.kebony.com/">Kebony</a>, has come up with. Billing itself as a ‘wood modification technology company’, Kebony has now raised a €30 million ($34M) funding round led by Jolt Capital and Lightrock. And how it does this is fascinating.</p>
<p>Kebony starts with sustainably harvested wood, then modifies that wood with waste coming from the food production process associated with sugarcane and corncobs. The company says this can give the wood a long-lasting character which actually mirrors the behavior and characteristics of tropical hardwoods.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, as the construction industry increasingly looks for greener construction materials, using this type of material makes a lot of sense, not to mention the fact that it might well reduce tropical deforestation.<br />
 <br />
Kebony claims this treatment transforms wood like pine into a wood with features that are “comparable, and in some cases superior, to those of precious tropical hardwoods.” It also says the process is superior to traditional wood treatment based on impregnation with wood preservatives.<br />
 <br />
Kebony’s financing round is led by Jolt Capital and Lightrock. They are joined by previous shareholders Goran, MVP, FPIM, PMV and Investinor, of which the latter two will remain represented on the board.</p>
<p>Kebony’s core markets are Europe and the US, where it plans to expand. The European timber market is worth in the region of €3 billion for the residential and non-residential construction industries.<br />
 <br />
Norman Willemsen, Chief Executive Officer of Kebony said: “Kebony produces the most beautiful and ecological wood on the market, with a superior quality that is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225354" style="width: 817px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225354" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg" alt="Kebony founders: Norman Willemsen (CEO) and Thomas Vanholme (CFO)" width="807" height="469" class="size-full wp-image-2225354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg 807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225354" class="wp-caption-text">Kebony founders: Norman Willemsen (CEO) and Thomas Vanholme (CFO)</p></div></p>
<p>Antoine Trannoy, Managing Partner at Jolt Capital commented: “At Jolt Capital we have a strong interest in material science companies which leverage their patented technologies to offer sustainable products. With over 20 years of R&amp;D in woodtech and a well-proven process that gives cultivated soft woods the desirable properties of hard tropical ones, Kebony is one of them.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Kevin Bone, Partner at Lightrock added: &#8220;Kebony is perfectly positioned in the race for a decarbonized world with an ambition to be the leader within wood modification technologies.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kebony says it reported revenue growth of 23% in the first half of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, with a strong positive EBITDA.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Willemsen explained: “What we do actually is we impregnate the wood and put it in an autoclave. This changes the cell walls of the wood structure permanently and gives it a permanently changed character which actually lengthens the lifetime of the wood.”</p>
<p>Yes, but how scalable is it all, I asked?</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s actually very scalable,” he said. “We have two operations up and running right now. We&#8217;ve got basically a blueprint to scale it up further.”</p>
<p>He said compared to traditional materials, such as concrete and steel, their carbon footprint is “significantly less. We have emissions of about 350 kilos, co2 per cubic metre. If we compare this to, for example, steel, or the traditional hardwoods, those are around 10,000 killos. So we&#8217;re a very small portion of those other materials.”</p>

<p><a href="https://wavemaker.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wavemaker Partners</a> doesn’t just want to invest in climate tech and sustainability startups. It also wants to help build them. Today, the Singapore-based firm announced the launch of <a href="https://wavemakerimpact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wavemaker Impact</a>, a venture builder that identifies potential business opportunities, finds seasoned entrepreneurs to turn those ideas into startups and acts like a co-founder as companies scale.</p>
<p>Wavemaker Impact is planning to a raise $25 million for its first fund and is currently looking for founders. The founding team includes Wavemaker managing partner Paul Santos; PropertyGuru founder and impact investor Steve Melhuish; Doug Parker, the former COO of Nutonomy; and Quentin Vaquette and Marie Cheong. Vaquette and Cheong led <a href="https://apac.engiefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENGIE Factory</a>, the sustainability-focused Southeast Asia venture arm of ENGIE Group, one of the world’s largest utility companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225561" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Santos told TechCrunch that Southeast Asia is filled with opportunities to create what Wavemaker Impact calls 100X100 companies, meaning they can generate $100 million in revenue while abating about 100 million metric tons of carbon. He says the firm has already identified over 50 issues that startups can address in sectors like land use and carbon sinks, agriculture and food, industrial processes and energy.</p>
<p>Vaquette and Cheong first met the Wavemaker team when it invested in <a href="https://www.tablepointer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TablePointer</a>, an energy efficiency startup that was one of the first companies to emerge from ENGIE Factory.</p>
<p>“To us that was a real validation,” Cheong told TechCrunch. “If you can follow the process and find the right entrepreneur to work with, you can build a company that has the ability to have a significant carbon impact, but also that the venture world recognizes is investable.”</p>
<p>Much of Southeast Asia’s economy is focused on regions that are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change. For example, researchers have found that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/21/world/asia/jakarta-sinking-climate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jakarta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City</a> are at risk of being underwater by 2050.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“120 million people in Southeast Asia rely on coastal regions for their livelihoods and that will all be significantly altered by climate change,” said Cheong. “One of the things we learned from COVID is that Singapore is this gorgeous city, but if our neighbors aren’t doing well, that’s going to really destabilize the whole region.”</p>
<p>On the upside, Wavemaker Impact’s founders say people are paying more attention to finding solutions. “It feels like the economy has woken up to the green transition in Southeast Asia, which is estimated to be an $2.7 trillion opportunity by itself,” Cheong said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It’s a big moment for climate change. Here are 4 books for autumn to understand what’s changing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/fall-climate-change-books/embed/#?secret=cbFEK3TaC1" data-secret="cbFEK3TaC1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wavemaker created its own emissions map focused on Southeast Asia, and found that 26% of the emissions in the region come from land use. “It’s something that is kind of unique to our region,” said Santos. “So let’s create business models that can help fight climate change and seriously address climate emissions, solutions that work for our market and are based on local dynamics.”</p>
<p>Before launching Wavemaker Impact, the firm implemented an internal initiative called Green Wave to look at its carbon footprint and hold workshops for portfolio founders. After talking with them, Wavemaker&#8217;s team realized that many startups were already thinking about how to reach sustainability goals, so it created a pledge for companies to enact more initiatives as they scale up. (Wavemaker has invested in more than 140 companies and currently has $180 million in AUM across its three funds in Southeast Asia.)</p>
<p>But even entrepreneurs with a track record of founding successful companies might have concerns about launching a climate tech or sustainability startup. That’s one of the things Wavemaker Impact wants to address.</p>
<p>“I met an entrepreneur yesterday and he said, ‘I feel like there’s a U-curve of learning, I’m on the downhill and I need to get deep before I get up,’” said Cheong. “Our pitch to him was, come work with us and you can start at least midway in your journey.”</p>
<p>For some entrepreneurs, the U-curve is thinking that they need a science background. “The energy work is super complicated, it’s kind of opaque,” said Cheong. “If you haven’t been working for an energy transition for the last 10 years, you probably don’t know what’s coming next. There’s all this data out there about climate change and lot of it is quite academic. It’s hard to translate that into ‘where’s the business opportunity here?’”</p>
<p>That’s where Wavemaker Impact and its network comes in.In addition to capital, Santos said part of Wavemaker Impact’s role will be acting as a co-founder, helping entrepreneurs identify opportunities, acquire their first customers, develop scalable business models and build teams. “Our value-add is saving time, through process and network,” he said.</p>
<p>Out of the 50 opportunities identified by Wavemaker in the climate tech and sustainability space, it is prioritizing 20 to match with entrepreneurs. For example, deforestation is a major issue in Indonesia, as land is cleared for palm oil crops. Another one is <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/09/13/simple-planting-switch-could-slash-rice-methane-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct-seeding rice crops</a>, which can reduce carbon emissions but hasn’t been widely adopted by farmers yet. All these are potential ideas for Wavemaker Impact entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“We have spaces where we know the TAM is big enough, the carbon potential is big enough and we know it’s possible, so we want to find somebody who is super passionate about the space, to talk to these farmers and understand how to build these companies,” said Cheong.</p>
<p>She added, “A lot of the time, people think that you need governments, you need scientists and R&amp;D and they’re like, ‘how do I, a guy who just built a big SaaS startup, make a difference?’ Our message is that we know how to build companies that have this scale and growth trajectory, that can be venture grade opportunities and abate carbon. It’s not about impact or profit, it’s the two of those together, and we really believe we need entrepreneurs to make this change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fiftyyears.com/">Fifty Years</a>, a six-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit with a portfolio that&#8217;s already rife with mostly deep tech companies &#8212; many with a good story to tell about how they can have an impact on the environment &#8212; just closed its third and newest fund with $90 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>The money isn&#8217;t coming from just anywhere. Firm cofounder Seth Bannon tells us the firm aimed to recruit founders of 20 so-called unicorn companies so that they would have a vested interest in &#8212; and could occasionally advise &#8212; its portfolio companies. He says that Fifty Years wound up instead with 44 &#8220;unicorn&#8221; founders, including from Spotify, Github, Skype, Supercell, Minecraft, Dropbox, Unity, Klarna, Zendesk, Kahoot, and Upstart.</p>
<p>Some of those founders were backed by Fifty Years, in fact, including the cofounders of the synthetic biology company Solugen, which is now valued by investors at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/solugen-raises-357-million-to-make-chemicals-and-plastic-from-plants.html">$1.8 billion</a> and which received its first check from Fifty Years; Astranis, a geostationary communications satellite operator that is currently valued at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/astranis-satellite-internet-raises-250-million-from-blackrock-others.html">$1.4 billion</a> and which also received its first check from Fifty Years; and Opentrons, a maker of affordable lab robots that is now valued at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/softbank-invests-in-robotics-company-behind-nyc-covid-testing?sref=gni836kR">$1.8 billion</a> (which Fifty Years backed as part of a broader seed round).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, Fifty Years &#8212; which is run by Bannon; firm cofounder Ela Madej; and six other full-time people, including a synthetic biologist &#8212; has a pretty good story to tell about itself for such a young firm.</p>
<p>First, it has an undeniably interesting portfolio. In addition to space satellites and sustainable chemicals, the firm&#8217;s bets include Upside Foods, the food tech company that was formerly known as Memphis Meats (and whose valuation is also estimated to now be in the billion-dollar range). It&#8217;s also an investor in Varda, a space manufacturing company that has raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-raises-over-50-million-to-build-space-factories.html">$51 million</a> and plans to make things in space to deliver back to earth.</p>
<p>Explains Bannon: &#8220;There are things like protein therapeutics, telecommunications fibers, and semiconductors that, because gravity interferes [with their production], you&#8217;d rather make without gravity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also unique, seemingly, is Fifty Years&#8217;s ability to connect with scientists and to help them start companies. It isn&#8217;t a matter of Bannon and Madej hanging out in college parking lots or tech transfer offices but instead creating initiatives that, while perhaps gimmicky, are also helpful for everyone involved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of these is a PhD-to-VC program wherein Fifty Years, with the help of its broader networks, helps to educate PhDs (as well as doctoral program drop-outs) about the ins and outs of venture capital over 10 weeks so that they might find their way into the industry. The academics get to learn the lingo and processes that are part and parcel of the venture world, while Fifty Years gets to know the academics.</p>
<p>Fifty Years also has a &#8220;super nerdy&#8221; podcast called the &#8220;Translation Podcast,&#8221; wherein the lead author of a breakthrough paper in biology is asked to go through his or her background and what they aim to accomplish with their research.</p>
<p>And Fifty Years has a platform dubbed the &#8220;Fifty 50&#8221; that brings together 50 top biologists from labs across North America who are provided content on entrepreneurship &#8212; as well as companionship, including via a Slack channel and in-person regional events.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do this because we heard from top biology PhDs that academia can be very isolating and that it&#8217;s hard to meet people who even share your interests,&#8221; says Bannon.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a connection dating back to Y Combinator, which both Bannon and Madej passed through, presumably helps. For example, it was through YC that Fifty Years met <a href="https://buildcover.com/">Cover</a>, a fast-growing maker of modular homes an ADUs.</p>
<p>As for where its new capital might flow, Bannon says that synthetic biology remains a major area of interest, thanks largely to Solugen. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown more active over time because the more a company begins to breakout, the more learnings you develop over time based on supporting that company, and the bigger your network in that space grows,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Madej is also &#8220;taking a deep dive into Web3 currently,&#8221; says Bannon. &#8220;We think enough core infrastructure has been built to allow people to build applications that create massive positive social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty Years will likely find willing co-investors along the way. Not only does Fifty Years have a portfolio it can brag about now, but unlike in 2015, when &#8220;we felt very lonely,&#8221; says Bannon, it&#8217;s &#8220;no longer fringe to say you can make great returns and make an impact. A ton of allies have come into this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very good news, as far as he&#8217;d concerned. &#8220;We don&#8217;t view anyone as competitive. We love working with Lowercarbon Capital. Chris [Sacca] has been an LP since our second fund and we love what they&#8217;ve been doing in climate. We like another firm, <a href="https://www.boomcap.co/">Boom Capital</a>, as well as <a href="https://cantos.vc/">Cantos</a>, which more or less exclusively partners with deep-tech impact companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of better-known venture outfits that &#8220;like really hard, really ambitious startups,&#8221; such as Founders Fund, he notes. Even still, says Bannon, there&#8217;s much more for the taking. When it comes to deep-tech investment firms, he says, in his view, &#8220;We probably need 10 times more of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty Years now has $200 million in assets under management altogether.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s on-demand delivery platform Glovo has announced what it&#8217;s calling &#8220;The Couriers Pledge&#8221; &#8212; an initiative which commits its business to setting a new &#8212; &#8220;fairer&#8221; &#8212; social rights standard for its gigging couriers.</p>
<p>The self-defined &#8220;standard&#8221; covers earnings, safety, communication and support for development opportunities.<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Glovo says the commitments will (eventually) apply to couriers working across its entire market footprint &#8212; whatever their exact employment status.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224832" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The delivery platform and dark store operator currently has 74,000 couriers across its market footprint (mostly in Europe and Africa) &#8212; but it says it expects to have 240,000 couriers active on the platform by 2023.</p>
<p>So the Pledge looks set to touch a lot of platform workers.</p>
<p>That said, the slated improvements to Glovers&#8217; (as it calls gig workers&#8217;) working conditions will not arrive overnight.</p>
<p>Instead, changes to bring its various regional operations in line with the Pledge will be rolled out gradually, over the next ~24 months &#8212; to take account of local differences in regulations and operational conditions, per co-founder Sacha Michaud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nor will the application of the Pledge be precisely uniform; each market will have specifics, reflecting local differences in ops or indeed laws. (He notes, for example, that in some markets it works with third party contractors who supply couriers &#8212; so it can only <em>ask</em> those other companies to make sure their workers are covered.)</p>
<p>The first of markets where the Pledge will be applied happen to sit at the edges of Europe: Georgia and Morocco.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Glovo says it will be figuring out the rollout map as it goes along &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear when its home market of Spain might be covered.</p>
<p>But it says its goal is to have its whole fleet of couriers covered by the end of 2023, and just under half (40%) by the end of Q2 2022.</p>
<h2>Fairwork is involved, but is it fair work?</h2>
<p>Glovo writes that it &#8220;collaborated&#8221; with <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork </a>&#8212; an academic research project which benchmarks gig platforms against a set of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/flipkart-ranked-highly-for-fairness-of-working-conditions-in-india-gig-platform-study/">fairness principles</a> &#8212; to help it come up with the contents of the Pledge, which is comprised of four components (see below), aka &#8220;pillars&#8221; as Glovo calls them.</p>
<p>However Fairwork told TechCrunch it does not endorse Glovo&#8217;s Pledge as &#8220;fully instituting fairness for Glovo workers&#8221; &#8212; dubbing it only a &#8220;first step towards improving conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the preliminary external assessment is that Glovo could still do a lot better.</p>
<p>Fairwork will be carrying out regular (possibly quarterly or biannual) audits to assess whether Glovo is living up to the commitments as it rolls the Pledge out across its markets.</p>
<p>Glovo has said these reports will be made public.</p>
<p>It also specifies that Fairwork is not being paid by it for this oversight work &#8212; in order to preserve its independence.</p>
<p>Going public about wanting to improve and being transparent about whether it actually has is a key part of the strategy here, per Michaud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We identified that this is the right thing to do and we&#8217;re going to commit openly to doing that,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We need a window to execute on that in the different regions for the complexity of our business from an operations perspective and regulatory and we&#8217;ll find a way to make it happen in every single country &#8212; and the ones we launch in the future as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Michaud is quick to talk up what he argues are the &#8220;good things&#8221; gig work has done for the world of work &#8212; reeling off familiar talking points like &#8220;easy access to income with very low barriers&#8221; for people who &#8220;maybe might have difficulty to find other types of work or income&#8221;; and of course the familiar gig platform claim of &#8220;flexibility&#8221;; or work that he euphemistically couches as having a &#8220;dynamic nature&#8221;; and maybe suits people who don&#8217;t do well with more traditional, rules-based employment &#8212; he accepts that a course correction is needed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That said, there is no admission that the model itself is intentionally exploitative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rather he suggests gig platforms historically miscalculated &#8212; believing they were catering to a specific niche of people who just needed a &#8220;few&#8221; extra hours&#8217; work to supplement their income. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But now the reality is a &#8220;large number&#8221; of Glovo&#8217;s couriers depend on the platform as their primary &#8212; or even sole &#8212; source of income, he says.   </span></p>
<p>Hence: &#8220;We have a certain responsibility as a company to give them more guarantees and more coverage so they can continue working on a certain baseline,&#8221; as he hedges its goal for the Pledge.</p>
<p>Michaud also rejects the idea that increased competition in the on-demand delivery space &#8212; with dark store/&#8217;q-commerce&#8217; startups busy bubbling up all over Europe, as well as (new) on-demand delivery businesses zeroing in on dedicated niches (like pharmaceuticals or high end/lux brands) &#8212; is a (retention) motivation for Glovo offering couriers better conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think regulatory wise it&#8217;s going to move in this direction &#8212; that we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he hazards instead, adding: &#8220;We see no point in waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why, then, aren&#8217;t these conditions Glovo&#8217;s standard already? &#8220;Operationally wise it&#8217;s complex,&#8221; is his response on that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynamics in every market is very different and regulation is very different &#8212; sometimes it&#8217;s not that easy,&#8221; he also argues. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of choosing which is the best model, generally and pretty much adamantly our couriers have said, very large percentage wise, that they want flexibility at the same time as having decent earnings and autonomy. And sometimes, depending on the regulation, it&#8217;s quite complex to manage both those things.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s why the commitment &#8212; and the two year window [to roll it out].&#8221;</p>
<h2>Mind the fairness gaps</h2>
<p>Michaud describes the goal for the Pledge as being to plug what he calls &#8220;gaps&#8221; in the fairness of couriers&#8217; working conditions.</p>
<p>Glovo&#8217;s PR announcement also talks about creating &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">equality of access to social rights and benefits for couriers, independent of the way couriers work with the platform&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some gaps still,&#8221; says Michaud in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;As a company &#8212; and other platforms as well &#8212; I think we need to fill those gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our commitment to the pledge is to try and cover the gaps and improve them, and make a commitment that by a certain date &#8212; the end of 2023 &#8212; that any courier on our platform will have certain minimum guarantees or social rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are the four components Glovo lists in the &#8216;Couriers Pledge&#8217; &#8212; and how it (top-line) defines them:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>FAIR EARNINGS</strong><br />
&#8220;Fair earnings per hour should be secured and regular collaboration has to be rewarded.&#8221;<br />
<strong>360o SAFETY</strong><br />
&#8220;All couriers must have fully fledged insurances covering any unforeseen situation. Safety on the road has to be a top priority.&#8221;<br />
<strong>PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT</strong><br />
&#8220;We will hear and act upon couriers’ needs and issues in a transparent manner following a two-way communication.&#8221;<br />
<strong>CARING FOR COURIERS</strong><br />
&#8220;Working as a rider should be a temporary thing. Fostering learning opportunities and keeping an open dialogue is a key goal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a little more detail in the fuller document Glovo also shared &#8212; where, for example, &#8220;proactive management&#8221; boils down to &#8220;Demostrable Service Level Agreements (SLAs)&#8221; being implemented &#8220;to guarantee effective communications&#8221; between courier and platform staff, and it offers the commitment that: &#8220;Any difficult concept or the algorithm logic needs to be explained in a simple and understandable way, so they know how the Glovo platform works.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also pledges an &#8220;easy appealing process&#8221; if a courier is disabled from the app.</p>
<p>But there is zero talk of collective bargaining &#8212; something <em>workers</em> in the EU are entitled to <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf"><em>as a right</em></a>.</p>
<p>Michaud bills the initiative as &#8220;open&#8221; &#8212; hence why, presumably, Glovo isn&#8217;t branding it &#8216;The <em>Glovo</em> Couriers Pledge&#8217; &#8212; as he&#8217;s &#8220;hopeful&#8221; other delivery platforms will sign up.</p>
<p>Although he adds that it hasn&#8217;t yet approached any competitors about doing so.</p>
<p>On this, it&#8217;s worth noting that Uber already came out with its own suggestion for &#8220;a new standard for platform work&#8221; (as it put it) for Europe back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">February</a> &#8212; when it published a whitepaper lobbying the EU to adopt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">California-style laws that don&#8217;t disrupt its business model</a> (i.e. by requiring it to pay full employment benefits).</p>
<p>Whether Glovo&#8217;s Pledge has more substance than Uber&#8217;s whitepaper remains to be seen &#8212; but engaging Fairwork as an auditor is certainly an interesting and laudable step. After all, the group wasted no time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">blasting Uber&#8217;s whitepaper as &#8220;corporate lobbying masquerading as progressiveism&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Fairwork also accused Uber of trying to “<span data-contrast="auto">legitimize a lower level of protection for platform workers than most European workers benefit from” &#8212;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> arguing there&#8217;s plenty of scope for it to improve conditions for workers within existing laws and further excoriating it for claiming improved conditions are dependent on regulatory change. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So Glovo will need to tread carefully to avoid a similar accusation that it&#8217;s delaying rolling out better working conditions for portions of its gig workers as a cynical ratchet to try to drive local policy change to align with its business model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The wider context here is of course that gig platforms have &#8212; even from the get-go &#8212; faced accusations that they are inherently exploitative of labor and seek to erode workers rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Critics accusing them of applying </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a bogus classification of &#8216;self-employment&#8217; that exploits delivery couriers by extracting the labor of an army of precarious but essential (to the business&#8217; function) labor force without providing the benefits and rights of employment.</span></p>
<p>Platforms typically counter such accusations by arguing that couriers want gigging &#8216;flexibility&#8217; rather than traditional employment &#8212; and further claiming &#8216;outdated&#8217; employment laws don&#8217;t allow them to provide benefits without applying the sort of rigid conditions their workers don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>However on that they are counter-accused of a self-serving, selective interpretation of the law; and, therefore, of dragging their feet on offering better conditions. (See <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">Fairwork&#8217;s aformentioned evisceration of Uber</a>.)</p>
<p>They have also often lost litigation challenging their employment classifications.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Uber lost a long running employment litigation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">earlier this year</a>, after the Supreme Court ruled that a group of drivers were workers, not self-employed contractors as Uber had tried to argue (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">for literally years</a>).</p>
<p>While, in Spain &#8212; one of the markets where Glovo operates &#8212; the country&#8217;s top court rejected its classification of delivery couriers as &#8216;<em>autónomos</em>&#8216; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">last year</a>. And lawmakers there have since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">passed a labor reform</a> specifically targeted at recognizing platform delivery couriers as employees. (Portugal is also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/portugals-gig-economy-workers-set-become-staff-2021-10-22/">reported to be eyeing a similar law</a>.)</p>

<p>Glovo did not responded to the change in Spanish law by instantly employing the circa 10,000 couriers active on its platform in the country. It has said it will be hiring around 1,800 couriers (but Michaud admits it hasn&#8217;t yet hit that figure).</p>
<p>It has also chosen to make changes to how it operates the platform to try to justify keeping a majority of its local Glovers as &#8216;freelance&#8217; couriers. (Some of whom may be employed by third party agencies &#8212; at which point they are essentially being subcontracted to do gig jobs on its platform but which it argues Spain&#8217;s labor reform allows.)</p>
<p>The net result is that even with a labor law in place that <em>says</em> delivery couriers working on platforms like Glovo are employees, plenty of platform workers in the country are (still) not employed and thereby face a variety of working conditions.</p>
<p>This in turn means Glovo&#8217;s decision <em>not</em> to prioritize rolling out the Pledge to couriers in its home market looks, well, interesting.</p>
<p>Michaud claims Spain&#8217;s regulations make applying the commitments there more &#8220;complex&#8221; &#8212; since he argues that most of its local couriers don&#8217;t want to be employed; and that local employment law on freelancers/self-employed ties its hands on giving additional benefits &#8212; &#8220;because it would imply a labor relationship&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, I insist, most of these workers don&#8217;t want [employment] &#8212; so you&#8217;re excluding them,&#8221; is his familiar line of argument.</p>
<p>This suggests Glovo will be directing its efforts in Spain (at least initially), not on improving working conditions for the majority of couriers but pushing for amendments to the labor reform to allow it to (eventually) raise courier benefits (somewhat) &#8212; without having to reclassify them as full-fat employees as the law intends, and which would instantly give them&#8230; well&#8230; far better working conditions.</p>
<p>So it is, to put it politely, rather tautological.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Michaud summarizes its domestic plan as: &#8220;Working with the social agents and finding common ground to get those workers that stay autonomous&#8230; the benefits and the guarantees that they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also points to how Glovo is now operating in Italy &#8212; calling it &#8220;a good guideline&#8221; of what it&#8217;s hoping to achieve elsewhere via the Pledge &#8212;  flagging a recent gig economy regulation he says covered a lot of the things that are already in the commitments.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example we give guaranteed income per hour there &#8212; but they&#8217;re freelancers. We begin paying their social security directly &#8212; so they&#8217;re covered when they&#8217;re ill. It includes safety, training and obviously material. And obviously it includes further education &#8212; so all the pieces that sometimes are missing. So that&#8217;s a fairly good reference.</p>
<p>&#8220;There we are giving guaranteed income, earnings per hour&#8230; It maintains the flexibility, they&#8217;re autonomous&#8230; they have collective voice, they&#8217;re represented by trades unions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, there are further steps Glovo believes it can make for couriers there too, per Michaud, who adds: &#8220;Italy will hopefully be under the Pledge early next year.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Towards better gig work across the EU?</h2>
<p>European Union lawmakers, meanwhile, have an active eye on conditions in the gig economy across the bloc &#8212; having been nudged to take a public interest by the surge in popularity of delivery platforms during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.</p>
<p>The Commission has spent the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">better part of this year</a> consulting on how conditions for gig workers might be improved, initially through platforms making changes themselves &#8212; but also dangling the prospect of pan-EU standards coming down the pipe.</p>
<p>So the EU&#8217;s executive scoping out potential legislation gives gig platforms a serious incentive to jockey for position &#8212; and try to frame the terms of debate. And, ultimately, pushing their own version of what &#8216;fair&#8217; standards are on policymakers.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_805">speech</a> back in February the EU&#8217;s digital policy chief, Margrethe Vestager, warned that what she acknowledged can be “poor” and “precarious” working conditions on gig platforms must be &#8220;addressed&#8221;.</p>
<p>But she also talked of wanting to &#8220;find a balance between making the most of the opportunities of the platform economy and ensuring that the social rights of people working in it are the same as in the traditional economy&#8221;. So it&#8217;s really not clear what the Commission is cooking. (And at the time of writing the EU executive had not responded to a request for an update.)</p>
<p>With the EU&#8217;s process ongoing, Glovo&#8217;s pledge is timed to pre-empt any rules the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers might draw up &#8212; and which could even end up over-ruling country-specific labor reforms (potentially rolling back those &#8220;complex&#8221; regulations that so trouble gig platforms&#8217; business interests).</p>
<p>That means Glovo&#8217;s Pledge must be read, at least in part, as a lobbying instrument &#8212; illustrating its strategic red lines.</p>
<p>It is notable, for example, that Glovo&#8217;s pledge on earnings does not commit to paying couriers for every single hour of working time. Such as when they are logged into the app and waiting for a job to come in; or waiting outside a restaurant for a delivery to be made up and brought out to them; or biking through traffic jams and pouring rain trying to find a customer&#8217;s address; or waiting outside the customer&#8217;s address for the person to answer the door. And so on.</p>
<p>Michaud confirms that Glovo continues to pay couriers <em>per delivery</em>.</p>
<p>The pledge as it stands doesn&#8217;t change that. Rather the suggestion is Glovo will &#8216;top-up&#8217; courier earnings if they fall below a locally set wage indicator for hourly earnings (it says it&#8217;s using WageIndictator data to make these calculations), as well as factoring in any additional costs the courier may have to fund to carry out deliveries in that location (e.g. bike repairs, fuel etc).</p>
<p>So its definition of &#8220;fair&#8221; earnings continues to limit how much couriers can earn on its platform by not paying for all their actual working time.</p>
<p>This is a recurring battleground in gig economy litigation. And &#8212; over in the UK &#8212; Uber&#8217;s recent, post-Supreme Court ruling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">announcement</a>, claiming it would now treat drivers in the country as &#8220;workers&#8221;, did not extend to paying them for all the hours they clock up logged into the Uber app either; instead it said it would be calculating working time from the point a trip commences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today they&#8217;re only paid per job,&#8221; confirms Michaud &#8212; referring to the majority of Glovo delivery couriers who the startup does not directly employ, before adding: &#8220;We have different types [of employment relationships with couriers] so it&#8217;s very varied &#8212; that&#8217;s why we wanted to equal the playing field for everyone to a certain [extent].&#8221;</p>
<p>We raised this issue with Glovo&#8217;s chosen auditor, Fairwork, suggesting that paying by working time would be fairer than paying per delivery &#8212; and they agreed.</p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="il">&#8220;Fairwork</span> advised Glovo on how their pledge could comply with the <span class="il">Fairwork</span> principles. In that process we advised them that workers should be paid for waiting time, at the rate of the living wage,&#8221; researcher Alessio Bertolini told us. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;Fairwork</span> will be auditing and scoring Glovo on that basis. We are pleased that Glovo has consulted with us in this process, and has indicated openness to being held accountable to their commitments by <span class="il">Fairwork</span>. However, this does not constitute an endorsement from <span class="il">Fairwork</span> of Glovo&#8217;s commitments as fully meeting all standards of fairness,&#8221; he added. <u></u></p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Workers are actively contributing to platforms’ operations and revenue, and to customers’ ability to receive prompt service, during all the time they are logged in and available to accept jobs. They are giving up personal time, and the freedom to do other activities in other places. They are also often representing the platform, with branded equipment and apparel. For all these reasons, it is <span class="il">Fairwork</span>’s strong position that waiting time is working time and should attract <span class="il">fair</span> pay.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop">So, well, Glovo may find its first full Fairwork audit a fairly painful read too. </span></p>
<p>For the record, Michaud dodged the question about paying couriers&#8217; working time rather than per delivery when we put it to him &#8212; sidestepping into a tangent on how it measures &#8220;earnings per hour&#8221; to ensure they reflect a local average based on data from WageIndicator (but that&#8217;s not what we were asking).</p>
<p>He also segued into talking about Glovo&#8217;s use of technology to distribute jobs to couriers &#8212; saying it has &#8220;stock management systems&#8221; in most of the countries where it operates which he said are intended to &#8220;optimize&#8221; supply and demand in order to make up earnings to that local wage level. (Presumably by sharing out available jobs between couriers to avoid too much of an earnings skew between individuals.)</p>
<p>With the Pledge, he says the idea is to plug gaps in this job distribution system &#8212; topping up earnings in instances where couriers aren&#8217;t sent enough jobs by the platform &#8212; but not plugging the bigger wage gap resulting from Glovo choosing not to pay out their working time.</p>
<p>He mentions a courier he says he met recently in Ghana &#8212; who told him that he&#8217;d been working for over two hours and had only had three deliveries, saying that&#8217;s &#8220;not good enough&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;the type of thing we want to address&#8221;, before adding: &#8220;We want to step up&#8230; And hopefully other companies will join us in raising the bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>However Glovo&#8217;s preference for &#8220;raising the bar&#8221; on courier earnings remains far below Fairwork&#8217;s definition of what is actually fair pay &#8212; and, well, what European employment law has long established as fair: A minimum wage per each hour of time worked. So &#8212; for now at least &#8212; it is essentially a familiar gig economy push to try to normalize a lower tier of employment rights for platform workers, who are already among the most vulnerable and precariously placed workers in society.</p>
<p>Whether EU policymakers will be swayed by this deregulatory pitch is the next pressing question.</p>
<p>Michaud confirms he will be <span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">presenting the Pledge to the Commission and members of the European Parliament this week. (</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">T</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">he support of MEPs will be required to pass any EU legislation in this area &#8212; parliamentarians also frequently amend Commission proposals.) </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the way the gig economy will go, especially in Europe,&#8221; he suggests, fleshing out the pitch EU lawmakers will hear. &#8220;There&#8217;s a strong case for who the workers are on these platforms &#8212; who generally have low access to &#8216;normal&#8217; employment, or certainly at that given time. It&#8217;s easy access to income, it&#8217;s very flexible and dynamic. And then again what I think is true if someone is working on a platform and it&#8217;s the primary source or very important source of their income &#8212; although we will cover everyone, even if they&#8217;re only working five hours a week they&#8217;ll still have the necessary coverage &#8212; I think there needs to be better coverage, better social benefits. When they&#8217;re ill they should have coverage and things like that. Which often are not covered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for its assessment of the <span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">general state of delivery gig <span class="il">worker conditions</span> across Europe, Fairworks&#8217; Bertolini said standards are shockingly low &#8212; which may be why some of the bigger (and better resourced) gig platforms, with l<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">ashings of VC cash</a> to spend on an in-house team of policy staffers to hone pitches and lobby lawmakers, spy a chance to frame themselves as offering &#8216;higher&#8217; gig work standards. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;</span></span><u></u><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">As previous <span class="il">Fairwork</span> reports in Europe, such as Germany and UK, already have shown, the vast majority of platforms fail to provide even the most basic labour standards that would be considered <span class="il">fair</span>,&#8221; he went on. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Some of the main issues include the lack of a minimum wage floor, lack of statutory health and safety protections, lack of access to due process and lack of channels for collective representation. Many of these issues stem from the classification of workers as self-employed or independent contractors in order for platforms to avoid obligations and protections.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Regardless of employment status, all workers should have the same basic legal rights and social protections,&#8221; Bertolini added. &#8220;If a lower tier of protections for certain classes of workers is institutionalized, we risk seeing a race to the bottom.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">He also warned that putting guarantees into law to avoid the misclassification of independent contractors aren&#8217;t in and of themselves a panacea &#8212; as Spain is perhaps finding out now. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;We believe that guaranteeing that workers are not misclassified as independent contractors is an important part of the solution but it shouldn’t be everything. What we are seeing in many countries is that even platforms that rely on an employment model can use systems of sub-contractors to avoid their legal responsibilities. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Any future EU legislation should take into consideration these issues and make sure that these companies are made responsible for the conditions of the workers on their platform. We believe all workers, however they are classified, should benefit from minimum standards of fairness in their jobs.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">Bertolini also said that, g</span></span><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">iven the variety of classifications and rights associated with employment status in different countries, <span class="il">Fairwork&#8217;s view</span> is it most important to ensure that all workers are provided with decent labour standards across <span class="il">Fair</span> Pay, <span class="il">Fair</span> Conditions, <span class="il">Fair</span> Contacts, <span class="il">Fair</span> Management and <span class="il">Fair</span> Representation &#8212; regardless of their specific employment classification. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;We do not support any employment classification system that falls short of guaranteeing these standards for all gig workers, such as the example of Prop 22 in California,&#8221; he added. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop">So Commission lawmakers look like they&#8217;re going to have their work cut out to find their sought for &#8220;balance&#8221; between precarity and stability. Screwing their courage to the sticking place may be more profitable on this fundamental rights issue. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurance policy provider Acko is the latest Indian startup to become a unicorn, joining nearly three dozen other firms in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market that have attainted the coveted status this year.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered startup said it has raised $255 million in a new financing round, bringing its all-time raise to $450 million. The new financing round, which is subject to approval from the country&#8217;s insurance regulator, was led by General Atlantic and Multiples Private Equity.</p>
<p>CPPIB, Canada&#8217;s largest pension fund and Lightspeed Growth as well as existing investors Intact Ventures and Munich Re Ventures also participated in the round, which values the five-year-old startup at $1.1 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/amazon-backed-indian-insurtech-startup-acko-raises-60-million/">$500 million a year ago</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.acko.com">Acko</a> is attempting to take on the country’s antiquated insurance industry with a digital-first product. It develops and sells bite-sized auto insurance products (aimed at drivers and others in transportation-related scenarios), healthcare protections to employers, as well as protection on gadgets.</p>
<p>The startup has distribution partners with a number of firms including Amazon, which is an existing investor in Acko, as well as travel and hotel booking platform MakeMyTrip, ride-hailing firm Ola, insurance giant Bajaj Finance and Urban Company.</p>
<p>Acko covers nearly a million gig workers in the country through partnerships with companies including food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato. Overall, Acko has amassed over 70 million customers and is clocking a run rate of $175 million in premiums.</p>
<p>Offering a large catalog of bite-sized insurance policies is crucial for firms in India. Only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and most can’t afford sizable policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017. An average Indian makes about $2,100 a year, according to the World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>“ACKO has meaningfully redefined the protection category for consumers and plans to continue innovating in the space. We strongly believe in supporting our customers in protecting their valued assets or the health and safety of their loved ones via a differentiated product and value-added service,&#8221; said Acko founder and chief executive Varun Dua.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insurance and protection must work for people based on their unique risks and needs in a seamless, reliable fashion. We are thrilled to partner with trusted investors who have a deep understanding of the regulatory environment and bring firsthand experience in working with innovative, high-growth companies.”</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh capital to broaden its healthcare offerings and hire more talent across technology, product and data science roles.</p>
<p>“We also continue to deepen our health strategy and intend to invest over $150 million in the health business in the near future. We believe health insurance products, claims innovation and a deeply connected ecosystem of health services that improve health outcomes for customers are today’s most urgent needs.”</p>
<p>The funding comes at a time when scores of Indian startups are raising record amounts of capital at an unprecedented pace in India. This week itself, cross-border payments startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/zolve-raises-40-million-to-help-global-citizens-access-financial-services/">Zolve</a>, agritech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/dehaat-raises-115-million-in-the-largest-agritech-round-in-india/">DeHaat</a>, fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/india-groww-valued-at-3-billion-in-251-million-funding/">Groww</a>, and edtech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/indian-edtech-teachmint-valued-at-500-million-in-78-million-funding/">Teachmint</a> unveiled their new funding rounds. TechCrunch reported earlier this week that Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/">mint another unicorn in India</a> (DealShare).</p>
<p>Policybazaar, which competes with Acko, will open its initial public offering next week. The startup is looking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-online-insurer-policybazaar-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-over-800-million/">raise over $800 million in the IPO</a>.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/"><strong>Can Ro expand past generics?</strong></a><strong> </strong>In a detailed report, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">TechCrunch’s Natasha Mascarenhas</a> dug into Ro, the company behind Roman and other health-focused services as it works to expand its product mix and keep growing. Other issues at the company, per a host of sources, include low morale and refusal of “​​basic feedback.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">Rent the Runway sees strong public debut:</a></strong> Yesterday evening, Rent the Runway priced at $21 per share, the top end of its IPO range. TechCrunch read the strong pricing event as indicative of a warm IPO market not only for pure tech companies, but also unicorns that are more tech-enabled than <em>tech</em> tech. The company began trading today, initially rising before losing ground as the day grew late. (More on the company’s financials <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/uber-will-rent-up-to-50000-tesla-evs-to-drivers/"><b>Uber to rent 50,000 Teslas:</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember when Hertz announced that it was buying a host of Tesla electric cars? It turns out the news wasn’t just PR. The company is working with Uber to rent tens of thousands of the cars to Uber drivers. The result could be a higher-end, and perhaps greener, Uber fleet.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The 2021 IPO market is not going quietly into the night. It’s working to close out the year with a bang. News today indicates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/paytm-seeks-20-billion-valuation-in-indias-biggest-ipo/">that Paytm could snag a $20 billion valuation when it goes public</a>, setting records for its native India, while Brazil’s Nubank dropped a post sharing that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/nubank-files-to-go-public/">filed privately to go public</a>. The company will list in the United States with some trading planned for its own domestic market.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/abacus-ai-snags-50m-series-c-as-it-expands-into-computer-vision-use-cases/"><strong>Abacus.ai wants to democratize ML:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As far as goals go, Abacus’ plan to simplify machine learning model creation, as our own Ron Miller put it, is a good one. Tools like what the startup has in mind could lessen a market crunch in data talent and perhaps empower more workers to execute their own data-focused tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/daring-foods-bites-into-third-round-in-12-months-as-plant-based-chicken-product-enters-walmart/"><strong>Plant-based chicken is expensive:</strong></a> At least if you want to buy into the companies creating it. Today, Daring Foods announced that it has raised an eye-popping $65 million Series C, and that its plant-based chicken comp product will find shelf space in 3,000 Walmart locations. Given that Walmart is not the <em>first</em> megaretailer we’d anticipate would roll out fake chicken, the partnership could indicate that plant-based meats are more generally popular than we thought.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/groopit-announces-2m-pre-seed-to-help-execs-access-crowd-sourced-company-data/"><strong>Groopit wants to help corp leaders listen to staff more effectively:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The startup — founded by a longtime Microsoft staffer — just raised $2 million to build a product that, in the words of its founder Tammy Savage, “combines data collection and real-time data sharing into one lightweight workflow.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ourcrowd-raises-25m-from-softbanks-vision-fund-2/"><strong>SoftBank writes checks this small?</strong></a><strong> </strong>It turns out that the SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is capable of writing eight-figure checks. The investing group just put $25 million into Israeli startup OurCrowd. The startup operates a so-called venture platform, making its own fundraising slightly meta.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/truepills-latest-funding-boosts-valuation-to-1-6b-as-it-works-on-b2b-side-of-healthcare/"><strong>Truepill turns its sights to the corporate world:</strong></a><strong> </strong>According to TechCrunch reporting, from a focus on “telehealth, diagnostics and pharmacies for consumers,” Truepill is now “targeting healthcare incumbents.” The company just added $142 million to its accounts, valuing it at $1.6 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/clickup-raises-400m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-all-in-one-workplace-productivity-platform-to-europe/"><strong>Broad productivity app ClickUp now worth $4 billion:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Flush with $400 million worth of new capital, San Diego-based ClickUp has scaled its user base around 4x in the last year. What does it do? It brings together a bevy of features including chat, tasks, to-dos and more into a single package. Yes, all of tech is bundling and unbundling.</li>
<li>And from the podcast team, a warm if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/divining-the-future-of-vc-saying-goodbye-to-danny/">somewhat sad goodbye to Danny</a>, who is leaving Equity after a long, successful run on the hosting team.</li>

<h2>The Bowery Farming TC-1</h2>
<p>Just over a tenth of Americans have jobs in food and agriculture, so it&#8217;s easy to see why many of us lack a keen awareness about what we&#8217;re eating or where it comes from.</p>
<p>Our food supply isn&#8217;t as secure or predictable as we assumed: Climate change, safety recalls, the COVID-19 pandemic and even immigration policies can directly impact what’s available at the store. The technological leaps that made it possible to feed (most of) the world will not see us through the next century unless we change course.</p>
<p>Plant-based protein has gotten a lot of press, but vertical farming that leans on hardware and robotics has reached scale, reports Brian Heater, TechCrunch hardware editor.</p>
<p>In a four-part series, he explores the origins and operations of Bowery Farming, a profitable startup that has raised almost $500 million since 2015 to create new tech and facilities that raise leafy greens sold in nearly 900 markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-technology/">Can LEDs ultimately replace the sun?</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">The voracious fight for your salad bowl</a></span></p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has a startup focus, but we do watch former startups after they reach the public markets. For a few quarters, at least. Today shares of Robinhood — until very recently a private unicorn — are off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">after the company reported results and forecasts that came in under market expectations</a>. What its lackluster performance data will mean for other transaction-based trading platforms is not clear at this juncture.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/linkedin-rolls-out-its-freelance-services-marketplace-globally-after-picking-up-2m-users-in-smaller-us-beta/"><b>LinkedIn’s freelance push goes global:</b></a><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After testing in the United States market — LinkedIn’s home turf, if you will — the company is bringing its “Service Marketplace” to more geographies. If you are familiar with Fiverr, this is perhaps comparable. Regardless, the move shows that LinkedIn is capable of making headlines </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that are not discussing major retrenchments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/"><strong>Amazon cuts climate checks:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The megaretailer is putting its $2 billion climate fund to work by putting capital into three startups. TechCrunch has the deets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/how-to-delete-your-kids-pictures-google-search/"><strong>Google will now allow under-18s to delete images of themselves from search:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Announced back in August, this new Google capability reminds me a bit of what Europe has mandated for its own lands. Perhaps we will get more EU-style digital tooling for consumers here in the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/"><strong>Which tech giant is the podcast king?</strong></a> Spotify is deep into an effort to broaden its content base away from tunes to include a deep podcast library that may be bearing fruit. Per the company, it is now the leading destination for podcast listening in the United States. I’ve requested our own podcast results from Spotify as, well, I am now curious.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/self-driving-company-cruise-on-track-for-early-commercial-operations-in-2022/"><strong>Robotaxis, delivery vehicles are just around the corner:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Like, really. Per GM’s Cruise group, commercial operations of its self-driving cars could come in 2022. That’s brilliant news. Please, megacorps of the world, spare me having to drive for the rest of my life. I want to quietly read a book while a computer handles the turn signals.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security bug in the <a href="https://docket.care/#security">health app Docket</a> exposed the private information of residents vaccinated against COVID-19 in New Jersey and Utah, where the app received endorsements from state officials.</p>
<p>Docket lets residents download and carry a digital copy of their immunizations by pulling their vaccination records from their state&#8217;s health authority. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/apple-wallet-is-getting-verifiable-covid-19-vaccination-cards/">digital copy</a> has the same information as the COVID-19 paper card, but is digitally signed by the state to prevent forgeries. Docket is one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">several so-called vaccine passports</a> in the U.S., allowing residents to show their vaccination records — or a scannable QR code — for getting into events, restaurants or crossing into countries where vaccines are required.</p>
<p>But for a time, the app allowed anyone access to the QR codes of other vaccinated users — and all the personal and vaccine information encoded within. That included names, dates of birth and information about a person&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccination status, such as which type of vaccine they received and when.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225136" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch discovered the bug on Tuesday and immediately contacted the company. Docket chief executive Michael Perretta said the bug was fixed at the server level a few hours later.</p>
<p>The bug was found in how the Docket app requests the user&#8217;s QR code from its servers. The user&#8217;s QR code is generated on the server in the form of a SMART Health Card, a widely accepted standard for validating a person&#8217;s vaccination status across the world. That QR code is tied to a user ID, which isn&#8217;t visible from the app, but can be viewed by looking at its network traffic using off-the-shelf software like Burp Suite or Charles Proxy.</p>

<p>But Docket&#8217;s servers weren&#8217;t checking to make sure the person requesting a QR code was allowed to request it. That meant it was possible for any app user to change their user ID and request someone else&#8217;s QR code. Worse, Docket user IDs are sequential, and so new QR codes could be enumerated simply by changing the user ID by a single digit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known if anyone else discovered the bug. Perretta said the company is &#8220;currently in the process of reviewing logs to determine if there was any malicious activity on the platform.&#8221; Perretta also said that the company was working to inform state governments about the lapse but did not say if the company planned to notify its users of the security lapse.</p>
<p>Nancy Kearney, a spokesperson for New Jersey&#8217;s Department of Health, said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New Jersey Department of Health was notified by our vendor, Docket, of a code vulnerability related to the recent release of a QR code associated with the app. Docket assured the Department that they identified and fixed the vulnerability within the code. No other functionality of the app was affected. The privacy and security of Docket users remains paramount. At this time, Docket is investigating for any indication of potential records that could have been compromised. The Department continues to work with Docket to ensure their ongoing vigilance on this matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for Minnesota&#8217;s Department of Health also not reply. (Docket is available for Minnesota residents, but the state has not yet deployed QR codes.)</p>
<p>Tom Hudachko, a spokesperson for Utah&#8217;s Department of Health, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Utah Department of Health is committed to ensuring the privacy of Utah residents and expects its contractors and partners to maintain the same commitment. Docket notified us [Tuesday] of a bug within its system that could potentially allow users to receive the personal information of other users. Docket has assured us they have identified what caused the bug and have resolved this issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We are working with Docket, and our own data security teams to identify any users that may have had their information inappropriately shared and provide appropriate notification to those individuals,&#8221; said Hudachko.</p>
<p>But questions remain about how the bug slipped through to begin with. It&#8217;s not known exactly how many vaccinated people&#8217;s records were at risk. Last week, Docket said in a since-deleted tweet that it had reached one million users. New Jersey and Utah have a combined 8.5 million residents who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Perretta would not say, when asked, what kind of security testing was done on Docket before its launch.</p>
<p>Utah&#8217;s Hudachko said that Docket went through a &#8220;thorough security review&#8221; by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), two offices housed within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An ONC spokesperson deferred comment to CMS and HHS, neither of which responded to our requests for comment.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which approved the app, also did not respond to questions asking if the agency had conducted a security review.</p>
<p>Docket isn&#8217;t the only vaccine passport app maker that&#8217;s faced security issues. The bug found in the Docket app is a nearly identical issue found in an app called Aura, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/">exposed thousands of QR codes</a> containing the vaccination status of staff and students. And earlier this year, the Calgary-based proof-of-vaccination app Portpass <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/portpass-privacy-breach-1.6191749">exposed the personal information</a> of hundreds of thousands of people after leaving its website unsecured, while one hacker was able to create an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/vaccination-passport-safety-security-hacker-1.6155488">entirely fake vaccine passport</a> using Quebec&#8217;s official proof-of-vaccination app.</p>
