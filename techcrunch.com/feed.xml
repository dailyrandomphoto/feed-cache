					<description><![CDATA[Its proprietary technology enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge what products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food and beverage startup <a href="http://www.thenakedmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Naked Market</a> bagged $27.5 million of Series A investment, led by Integrated Capital, to continue developing its line of healthier food brands.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 by Harrison Fugman, Alex Kost and Tim Marbach, who created a “fast fail” method to develop new foods that includes an end-to-end infrastructure that can go from idea to market in about three months. The company also handles distribution.</p>
<p>On the other side is a proprietary data tool called The Machine that gathers over 15 million data points from places like Shopify, direct customer feedback, Amazon, retail point of sale and search engine trends, to unearth category opportunities for the company to pursue. In addition, a direct customer feedback loop enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge which products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232364" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This portfolio approach is different because we are using a data-driven fast fail strategy,” CEO Fugman told TechCrunch. “We can start to identify foods and bring them to market in a matter of months versus years, and if we see a brand does not have product market fit, we can shut it down quickly.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SnackMagic picks up $15M to expand from build-your-own snack boxes into a wider gifting marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/snackmagic-picks-up-15m-to-expand-from-build-your-own-snack-boxes-into-a-wider-gifting-marketplace/embed/#?secret=6ZjkCEaeU5" data-secret="6ZjkCEaeU5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since its inception, The Naked Market has produced five brands, including Flock Chicken Chips, AvoCrazy, Project Breakfast and Beach House Bowls. Its latest brand, Rob’s Backstage Popcorn, is a joint venture with the Jonas Brothers.</p>
<p>Joining Integrated Capital in the round are Great Oaks Venture Capital, Pacific Tiger Group, Sope Creek Capital and Clearco. The Naked Market has raised over $33 million, which includes an earlier $6 million seed round.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Yam, executive director at Integrated Capital, met Fugman and Kost in Hong Kong and had already gotten to know them well when they presented Yam with their business plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yam said he liked the approach of going after the market size and the white space for challenger brands. He also was intrigued by the data-driven technology.</p>
<p>“The data-driven approach to identify winners and losers early on makes them a perfect platform to go after this market,” he added. “Their ability to bring products to market in a short amount of time, with asset-light infrastructure, is a big opportunity.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/snack-food-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack food market</a> was valued at $427 billion in 2020, and is expected to grow 3% annually through 2026. Fugman said a multibillion market like that “gets us excited to have this kind of landscape for disruption.” He notes that customer preference toward more healthier snacks over the past decade are giving companies, like his that are investing in R&amp;D, a seat at the table.</p>
<p>“Incumbents aren’t investing in R&amp;D, or if they are, they are spending low, single digits there, and this creates an opportunity,” Fugman added. “We are looking for categories where we can create a brand that goes after a market leader, and we feel that we have cracked the equation to identify the market and create a brand and reasonable scale.”</p>
<p>The Naked Market’s products have been on the market for just over 12 months, and the new funding will “pour fuel on that fire,” he said. The new capital will enable the company to scale its existing brands, create new products and pursue M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>The company has 10 employees and is experiencing triple-digit growth since its founding two years ago. Fugman expects to launch new brands in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>For now, the company is selling online but has intentions of going into retailers in coming years and has some partners already lined up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance lags behind other financial services in the adoption of digital technologies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, a few unicorns have popped up from the modern digital insurance space such as Tractable and Lemonade; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this sector hasn&#8217;t raced to the stage as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as say, payments or lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the global insurtech market worth over $5 trillion, there are different opportunities to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite the presence of large incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, one startup is carving a niche for itself. By way of using APIs, <a href="https://root.co.za/">Root</a> is helping businesses and developers launch insurance products faster than the traditional way. The company, based in South Africa, has raised $3 million in seed funding to scale outside Africa and build the infrastructure for the digital insurance economy.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232495" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital firms <a href="https://www.invenfin.com/">Invenfin</a>, Base Capital, Savannah Fund, P1 Ventures, Luno and FireID took part in the round, including some high-impact angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root started off with the premise that many barriers, including compliance and capital, prevented software developers and businesses from building and innovating around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/louwhopley">Louw Hopley</a> told TechCrunch he noticed in 2015 that while other financial services started to use APIs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help developers build products tailored to their offerings, nothing was being built around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got quite a strong feeling that insurance is stuck in the 1900s. There’s still a lot of paper </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even as consumer behaviour has moved to digital real-time. There’s a personalized kind of environment pretty much in every industry, but insurance is struggling to catch up,” he said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that’s kind of what we’re trying to figure out to break down those barriers and package it behind easy to use APIs so that people can start solving for this new modern digital personalized age</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley launched Root in 2016 to cater to this need. <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-stewart-5b686490">Jonathan Stewart</a> joined as a co-founder leading sales and partnerships in 2018.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root&#8217;s first product was programmable bank accounts and cards but it has moved on to providing insurance APIs which is now its core offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root plugs on top of insurance companies, actuaries or underwriters. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These companies then underwrite products that developers and business analysts using Root can then integrate into their existing customer experiences, which can exist on a website, chatbot or a mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232693" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232693" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Root" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg 5476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Root</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five-year-old company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targets non-insurance companies with a steady client base; businesses offering insurance as a secondary product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, telcos, retailers and banks. However, it also powers affinity insurance players; some of the largest in South Africa actually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these clients include Mr Price Money, FinChoice, Telkom, Metropolitan, Sanlam and Guardrisk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Root’s insurance infrastructure, these companies have processed millions of policies and thousands of claims each month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South Africa company makes money through subscription licensing fees based on its client’s size and complexity of their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to helping developers and businesses launch insurance products, Root provides channels for these businesses to reach more customers and takes care of compliance issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Root intends to roll out a flexible low-code digital insurance platform as it expands to other markets, Europe in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley does not mention the companies Root will expand into; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, judging by the level of insurance play in the region, the U.K., Germany and France might be at the top of the list</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Root has plans to hire more technical and business talent in Europe, Hopley says a large part of the company’s team will remain in South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, the company’s focus, especially as it expands into new terrain, is to build the operating system for the global insurance industry, said Hopley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there needs to be a standard platform for which people innovate and build their products and integrate with. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that means we want to be the platform all product innovators, actuaries and developers will log into to build insurance products and get them to market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if you do that you can drive much more innovation faster because you kind of enable sub economies to spin up and other people to start building specific solutions into insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integrates the whole industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Paul Rutherford of Base Capital said Root’s APIs bring simplicity to the complex world of insurance and improve consumers&#8217; and insurers’ experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikael Hajjar of P1 Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, notes that Root might be the best positioned Africa insurtech startup to gain market share in Europe and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How could Tencent not jump on the metaverse bandwagon when Facebook is hinging its future on the new buzzword?</p>
<p>At this stage, Tencent&#8217;s approach seems more measured than Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion</a> investment into its metaverse division. But any early hint from the Chinese social media and gaming giant will provide enough fodder for investor speculation.</p>
<p>During its earnings call on Wednesday, Tencent&#8217;s CEO Pony Ma unveiled the firm&#8217;s musings on metaverse for the first time:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Anything that makes the virtual world more real and the real world more rich with virtual experiences can become part of the metaverse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The firm&#8217;s executives then took turns trying to flesh out this tagline. While their definitions lost me at times, the bosses agreed on three general &#8220;pathways&#8221; to reach &#8220;the metaverse&#8221;.</p>
<p>The current crackdown sweeping across China&#8217;s internet industry could cast a shadow over any metaverse in the making. Tencent believed Beijing is &#8220;not fundamentally averse to the development of metaverse,&#8221; as long as the user experience is &#8220;provided under the regulatory framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to know what those regulations would look like when the country&#8217;s metaverses are still in their infancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Staircase to metaverse</h2>
<p>The most obvious path to metaverse is video games, the firm&#8217;s largest revenue driver. It could be highly interactive games, multiple games under one common IP, or infrastructure that enables users to make games, according to Ma.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas have already started to take shape at Tencent&#8217;s portfolio companies, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/tencent-epic/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/roblox-china/">Roblox</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Discord</a>. Yes, Tencent doesn&#8217;t try to do everything itself but has backed hundreds of businesses in which it finds strategic value.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-and-fortnite-collide-in-crossover-events-starting-this-weekend/">Fortnite together with Rocket League</a> in the Epic example, or multiple different so-called game experiences within the Roblox example,&#8221; explained James Mitchell, Tencent&#8217;s chief strategy officer.</p>
<p>The second pathway, according to Ma, could be a social network that is &#8220;gamified and supports much more programmable experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a social network needs a suite of tools. &#8220;One needs to both provide the 3D graphics capabilities&#8230; the one with the server-based community&#8221; and &#8220;provide the UGC and PGC tools that the game companies need,&#8221; explained Mitchell.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while social networks such as Meta itself and Snap have the most capital resources, they also have a good amount of work to do,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Another iteration of the path could be &#8220;real-world experience but augmented by augmented reality and virtual reality,&#8221; noted Ma.</p>
<p>Mitchell reckoned user-operated communities &#8220;that already have a high degree of functionality technology bots,&#8221; such as Discord, could move &#8220;from a text and image basis to more of an immersive video basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>How competent is Tencent to carry out these three plans? The company believes it&#8217;s equipped with the right talent and technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The driving force [of metaverse] will still be software-driven and the technology that really helps us to provide the user experience, be it engine technology, be it the ability to provide better, real experience, high-fidelity experience across many &#8212; a large number of concurrent users, AI technology, for example, in order to customize the different experience for different people,&#8221; said Martin Lau, president at Tencent.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share a timeline for when its metaverse will materialize, but Lau admitted it will &#8220;probably take longer than people expected and would probably need a number of iterations.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about an Oculus counterpart for Tencent? Lau believed &#8220;hardware will probably be an assisting condition but not the necessary condition&#8221; for metaverse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business education is, let’s face it, finding it hard to keep up with a <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/state-of-the-global-startup-economy">$3 trillion</a> global tech startup economy that&#8217;s booming right now. High-growth companies are time-starved and so are their executives, but the courses they are offered are long, often boring, and varying in quality. Ideally, business education should be more on-demand, targeted, practical, and byte-size.</p>
<p>So this, essentially is what <a href="http://useframework.com">Framework</a> has come up with, and it’s now raised a $2million seed round to create an ‘on-demand business school’.  The edtech platform says it has more than 2,500 people on its waitlist ahead of its launch next year. </p>
<p>The idea is that Framework members learn directly from tech operators from companies including Slack, ASOS, Flo Health and Netflix, via 15-minute ‘Frameworks’ and live office hours sessions. Members can also make 1:1 connections each other. This is sometimes called &#8216;snackable&#8217; content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Framework has spun out of Founders Academy, the 9-month “free alternative-MBA” born out of Founders Forum, a private network of the world’s elite tech entrepreneurs, largely drawn from Europe.</p>
<p>The backing is coming from LearnStart, the seed fund of Learn Capital, Evio, as well as the angel programs for Atomico and Ada Ventures. It also includes angel investors including Brent Hoberman (co-founder of lastminute.com, MADE.com), Claire Novorol (co-founder of Ada Health), Tom Foster-Caster (former COO at Monzo), Victoria van Lennep (co-founder of Lendable), and Aaron Mitchell (HR Director at Netflix). </p>
<p>Asha Haji, Co-Founder at Framework said: “Our mission is to scale a new generation of tech leaders by building the go-to learning community for startups and scaleups around the world.”</p>
<p>Riya Pabari, Co-Founder at Framework added: “As two female founders of color, it’s also our chance to fly the flag for all of the incredible under-represented founders who deserve more attention from the VC community.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Haji said: “Long-form learning is not available to most people who work in startups because of the expense of time. What we&#8217;re doing is microlearning… It’s really about doing it every day, practical questions. It’s not just the content, it&#8217;s the community as well. You get to engage with them one on one.”</p>
<p>Brent Hoberman, Co-Founder and Investor at Framework said: “Framework&#8217;s bite-sized lessons, practical cheat sheets, and engaging community features make it the modern learning platform the industry&#8217;s been waiting for, and Riya and Asha are the powerhouse duo to bring it to life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As investors continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">pour billions into super speedy on-demand grocery delivery</a> &#8212; trying to dislodge the dominance of traditional supermarket giants via a hyper convenience lever (whipping up some <a href="https://twitter.com/ridersxderechos/status/1457736716064808966">local opposition</a> to their 24/7 dark stores and delivery methods in the process) &#8212; other entrepreneurs are spotting opportunities to slow things down a little. And, well, spice things up.</p>
<p>Their goal is to slice off specialist market chunks by serving particular communities, requirements and tastes &#8212; say by delivering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/">premium, locally sourced groceries </a>or <a href="https://www.yababa.com/">catering to cultural difference</a> by stocking a wide range of ethnic produce.</p>
<p>On the latter front, meet <a href="https://my-oja.com/">Oja</a>: A London, UK-based startup that&#8217;s just scored a $3.4M pre-seed round, led by LocalGlobal, to build what it&#8217;s billing as the first online supermarket targeting the country&#8217;s growing cultural communities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232660" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other funds backing the startup include Acequia Capital; Tiny VC; and black angel group, HoaQ Fund. The round also includes a number of angel investors &#8212; including Darren Shapland (CFO of Sainsbury’s); David Vismans (CPO of Booking.com); Dimple Patel (COO of Trouva); Anton Soulier (formerly Deliveroo, now CEO of Taster); Sharmadean Reid (CEO of The Stack World); Spoken Word poet, Suli Breaks; Azeem Azhar (with a family link to the Asian food manufacturer TRS); and Riccardo Zacconi (co-founder of King.com).</p>
<p>Starting with a focus on serving London and its large African &amp; Caribbean community &#8212; Oja means &#8216;market&#8217; in Yoruba, a Nigerian language &#8212; the startup&#8217;s plan is to expand its inventory and app to serve a diverse range of ethnicities and cultures by stocking the foods and other wares (e.g. beauty products) which are sought by those communities; and by tailoring its app to provide what it describes as &#8220;a unique culturally-specific shopping experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oja&#8217;s pitch suggests its customers might span first-generation immigrants; busy young professionals looking to enjoy the food of their heritage; university students missing home comforts and who live in areas where it&#8217;s hard to buy ethnic food produce; and returning expats who want an easy way to access the specialist ingredients to cook the food they&#8217;ve been eating abroad.</p>
<p>For now it&#8217;s early days. The 2020-founded startup has run a small-scale pilot with around 200 users &#8212; which it says showed appetite for the service, with 67% of orders coming from repeat customers, and basket counts and sizes &#8220;exponentially rising&#8221; as more products were added to the online store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also notes that the app’s user base grew 56% &#8220;from word of mouth alone&#8221; during the pilot &#8212; arguing this shows the strength of community appeal that can drive reach of the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Favourites include plantain, yams, scotch bonnet chilli peppers, oxtail and more… fresh produce is extremely important to these communities,&#8221; adds founder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2021/europe/technology?profile=mariam-jimoh">Mariam Jimoh</a>, who bootstrapped the MVP (and previously founded the <a href="https://www.wcan.uk/">WCAN</a> social enterprise for black women).</p>
<p>She says the goal is to provide multicultural communities with &#8220;an essential service&#8221; that far surpasses the experience they can get in the &#8216;world food&#8217; aisle at a mainstream supermarket.</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice of ethnic produce in some supermarkets are very limited and Oja has everything you need in one place. Not only this, there are nuances for particular foods and items that are culturally specific that we aim to include; people care how ripe their plantains are or the way their meat is cut. We aim to include these nuances to speak directly to our customers,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app will allow you to shop by culture as we add more and more ethnicities to the assortment. Right now we sort things into cultures within one specific cultural group; African &amp; Caribbean. As part of our expansion plans, we will look to expand the other ethnic produce we offer in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>One challenge here is that an online supermarket stocking specialist ethnic produce will inevitably be competing with the small, local markets that have served these communities for years &#8212; and can also act as a vibrant community hub &#8212; so the app could be seen as breaking a crucial, IRL link for ethnic communities to get together on a daily basis, in and around buying fresh food.</p>
<p>At the same time, app-driven convenience is already eroding in-person retail. And younger generations may be less keen (or able) to spend the time to actually go to a market in person to buy their groceries. So there&#8217;s little doubt that traditional markets will face increased competition from specialist apps and online platforms.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, those startups that find ways to work with &#8212; and help sustain &#8212; in-person local ethnic produce markets might get the best reception from the communities they seek to serve.</p>

<p>Currently, Oja has one central fulfilment center which it&#8217;s using to serve the whole of London &#8212; with Jimoh saying its focus is on &#8220;access and ease vs extreme convenience at this stage&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This number will grow as smaller dark stores are launched based on where demand in cultures and products are strongest,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>On the delivery side, Oja is working with third party delivery services to pick up that piece &#8212; putting its initial focus on operations and customer experience, per Jimoh.</p>
<p>Scaling to cover more regions of the UK, as well as expanding the range of cultures it serves, is the goal for the pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>While Oja still has plenty of expansion to keep it busy within the UK, does Jimoh have any ambitions to scale the business outside the country?</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyday we have a tweet or message asking us when we are coming to Italy or France or even Ukraine &#8212; we think there is a market for this solution across all of Europe,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is really to unlock access to foods from every culture, from anywhere in the world. Our focus is London initially but we will quickly expand across the UK and then we certainly have our eye on Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the pre-seed raise in a statement, George Henry, general partner at LocalGlobe, added: “In a sea of grocery delivery services and apps, <span class="il">Oja</span> stands out for taking a new and refreshing approach. One that centres on community, heritage and access, as much as speed, convenience and variety. From the use of technology to her relationship and deep connections with suppliers, and her full-stack approach, Mariam and her team are building a game changing company that is set to raise the bar for the underserved communities across London, the UK and Europe.”</p>
<p>On the competition front, we&#8217;ve recently heard tell of a meaty seed funding round headed for a continental Europe-based ethnic grocery delivery app &#8212; so this slice of on-demand groceries certainly looks like it&#8217;s heating up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indonesia-based startup GoTo Group announced today it has secured more than $1.3 billion in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry. Further investors are expected to join in its final close of the funding in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group will use the proceeds to fuel its growth and bolster its customer service. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company declined to comment on its valuation. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to media reports, GoTo Group’s valuation is estimated at between <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57df6b26-79c2-41a3-9498-dffb9861fbc6">$28.5 billion</a> and $30 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, Indonesia’s two biggest startups, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">merged to form GoTo Group</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in May this year. GoTo Group is creating synergies with Gojek, Tokopedia and Goto Financial brands across transport, e-commerce, food and grocery delivery, logistics and financial service industries. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group, the largest technology group in the Southeast Asia nation, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is preparing for a dual listing</a> in New York and Jakarta later this year.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group claims that it generated over 1.8 billion transactions in 2020, with gross transaction value of over $22 billion, contributing to more than 2% of Indonesia’s GDP. Indonesia has more than $1 trillion in GDP with a population of 270 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Indonesia and Southeast Asia are some of the most exciting growth markets in the world, and the backing we’ve secured shows the confidence that investors have in the region’s rapidly expanding digital economy and our market-leading position,” said Andre Soelistyo, CEO of GoTo Group. “Consumer demand is being unlocked by growth in digital adoption that has brought many new users online. As a result, demand for our service continues to increase, underscored by our commitment to continuously deliver selection, value and convenience to users across the ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We foresee secular growth opportunities for Indonesia and GoTo across e-commerce, on-demand mobility and fintech – all segments in which Primavera has extensive investment experience. We’re excited to partner and grow together with GoTo, leveraging our expertise and resources where helpful for management,” Michael Woo, managing director of Primavera Capital Group. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria-based health tech startup <a href="https://heliumhealth.com/about.html">Helium Health</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.meddy.com/">Meddy</a>, a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> termed “a great deal” by Helium Health CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adegokeolubusi/">Adegoke Olubusi</a> on a call, is unusual in the sense that it overlaps two regions that rarely do in tech: Africa and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy CEO <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/harisaghadi">Haris Aghadi</a> and COO <a href="https://qa.linkedin.com/in/abedalkarimkhattab">Abed Alkarim Khattab</a> will join Helium’s leadership team as part of the deal. They will “play integral roles in Helium’s execution of its GCC strategy and operations.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230944" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium Health’s acquisition of Meddy is a major expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by Olubisi, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dimeji-sofowora">Dimeji Sofowora</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tito-ovia-51aa0413a">Tito Ovia</a> in 2016, is well-known for its core electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital management solutions in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has since evolved to offer other services under its platform, including HeliumPay, a billing and payments solution; a collateral-free loan product, HeliumCredit; patient-provider and revenue cycle management service HeliumDoc; and data analytics services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a presence in six African countries — Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Liberia, Kenya and Uganda — Helium Health has signed more than 500 healthcare facilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over 7,000 medical professionals from these facilities now provide care to more than 300,000 patients monthly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an enterprise client needs various services on one platform — from electronic medical record and management information systems to revenue cycle management, consolidated analytics and telemedicine services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most platforms in the GCC have use cases that are more vertical than horizontal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Vezeeta and Okadoc help users book appointments, access teleconsultation services and order medications; Bayzat offers an online platform for HR administration, payroll management and health insurance; and Clinicy runs a digital healthcare management system. So, for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enterprise clients to get a holistic EMR experience, they will need to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stack these different products on top of each other.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the SF-based Helium Health has a wide range of B2B offerings, it lacks in these other areas especially in telemedicine and appointment bookings, which are more consumer-facing products. The company could have built out these services but acquiring Meddy presented a better option due its expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from providing a doctor booking platform and telemedicine product to manage bookings and patient reviews, Meddy offers marketing solutions for hospitals to improve their online presence and attract new patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232550" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232550" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232550" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232550" class="wp-caption-text">Helium Health</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Meddy, the Y Combinator and Tencent-backed Helium Health can now cover a broader range of services health groups need. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy will merge with Helium Health’s patient-provider and revenue cycle management platform under the name Helium Doc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have a lot of people who can provide a suite like ours in the GCC. If they do, they’re doing it at a price point that’s so high that they’ve already priced out the market in that sense,” Olubusi said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we can provide a full suite where you can do your appointments booking, marketing solution, EMR, hospital management information system, and have everything in a one-stop shop. It saves you a lot of stress in the process from trying to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many different systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aghadi adds that the partnership gives interoperability to its clients, an absent feature in other EMRs and siloed individual platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many legacy and new products do not have open APIs and that makes it difficult for data to move between them. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ealthcare providers feel the brunt of this missing interoperability when they use such platforms to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make uninformed health decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interoperability is a very big challenge in the region, and having this one-stop place like ours </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solves that,” Aghadi remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two obvious factors — exploiting what other healthcare platforms lack and taking advantage of a growing opportunity in the GCC region (where investment in digital infrastructure will <a href="https://www.ld-export.com/en/numerous-opportunities-for-investment-in-gcc-healthcare_news_f5ebd2.html#:~:text=by%20regional%20Governments.-,According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20digital%20infrastructure%20will%20be%20high%20on,investments%20from%202023%20to%202030.">account for 30% of healthcare investment</a> between 2023 to 2030) — drove this acquisition and partnership, there is a third, more subtle factor Olubisi and Aghadi point out: the teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to both founders, the Helium Health and Meddy teams are identical in operations, technology execution, culture and market price points. These similarities made it easy for both companies to sign off the deal in less than four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beyond the actual product and market opportunity, what made this possible was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the composition of the team, how well they executed the fact that they share a DNA and culture that’s very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ours,” said Olubusi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy currently serves more than 150 private clients within the UAE and Qatar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, backed with just $1.8 million in VC funding, has facilitated over 200,000 doctor appointments while enabling healthcare providers to generate approximately $130 million in billings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both companies come together, Olubusi says the next plan is to figure out how better to serve the GCC market with its complete EMR solutions and, at the same time, roll out telemedicine and doctor booking services for its clients in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the next few months, a lot of what we’re doing is being able to better roll out these consolidated product suites in our markets and serve them more,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, we want to double, triple the growth of our client base over the next two to three years and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend our reach even further to make sure that Helium Health is the top health tech provider in the GCC region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it is in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hive levels the logistics playing field by streamlining fulfillment so that DTC companies get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that big brands use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive</a> announced $34 million in new investment Wednesday as it continues developing its technology that provides direct-to-consumer brands an alternative way to manage operations.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Oskar Ziegler, Franz Purucker and Leo von Kleist in July 2020 to offer software and operational services, including transparent cost structures, special features and sustainable packaging and shipping.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232361" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232361" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232361" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?w=680" alt="Hive" width="680" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg 3797w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=1536,1078 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=2048,1437 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232361" class="wp-caption-text">Hive founders, from left, Oskar Ziegler, Franz Purucker and Leo von Kleist. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hive</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ziegler, who started out in food delivery with foodpanda in Hong Kong, said he began consulting on e-commerce and logistics, and during a discussion with friends who were building DTC brands, the topic turned to operational problems.</p>
<p>“It was then that I thought we could build something to give small retailers the same logistics power as Amazon,” he added.</p>
<p>Purucker explained that when DTC brands get started, the founders are passionate about sales, marketing and finding the right message and influence to get their brand out into the world. However, when they go beyond 30 orders per month to more like 1,000, it becomes more difficult to check inventory from their homes, and they are not getting the cost-competitive rates from freight forwarders that the big brands are getting.</p>
<p>Hive levels that playing field by using data to streamline fulfillment, which he considered “the heart of the operation,” by providing a variety of delivery choices and the ability to get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that companies like Amazon are using.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding round was led by existing investors Earlybird and Picus and also includes new investor Tiger Global Management. It gives Hive total funding of $44 million and boosts its valuation to $157 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have looked extensively at the fulfillment space and gained conviction that the full stack model is superior due to its full control over the ultimate service quality,” Fabian Heilemann, partner at Earlybird, said via email. “Hive has compiled the strongest team in the European market to execute on that vision. That’s why we doubled down on our investment in this round.”</p>
<p>Now armed with the new capital, Hive intends to invest in product development and build out new services for supply chain and business teams that will have it triple its tech team by next year. It will also expand geographically, starting with Paris in early 2022. The company aims to bring down delivery times to two days in most places in Europe and next-day for core markets.</p>
<p>In 18 months, Hive quickly grew into a team of more than 100, working on the warehousing of products and the processing of orders through its own fulfillment center. During that time, the company’s revenue grew 10 times and it is processing a few thousand packages per day.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fall hasn&#8217;t been kind to Disney&#8217;s streaming ambitions. Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in its <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2021-earnings-results-webcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">fourth quarter</a>, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers. That&#8217;s in line with the company&#8217;s already cautious estimate (in the &#8220;low single-digit millions&#8221;) and 60 percent more total customers than a year earlier, but well below what some analysts expected. <em>CNBC</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2021-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">noted</a> that StreetAccount predicted 9.4 million new users this quarter.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s streaming-oriented Direct-to-Consumer division also lost $630 million (versus $374 million a year earlier) due in part to extra spending on production, marketing and &#8220;technology costs.&#8221; These were expected due to the growing service, but they suggest Disney+ isn&#8217;t yet a net positive for Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">two years after launch</a>. During an earnings call, company chief Bob Chapek was still confident the company would hit subscriber targets (over 230 million users by September 2024) and turn a profit.</p>
<p>The media giant had warned of &#8220;headwinds.&#8221; While it didn&#8217;t initially shed much light on the problems, we&#8217;d note that Disney+ had a relatively quiet summer for shows, with series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em>What If&#8230;?</em></a> and <em>Monsters at Work</em> shouldering the load. The company did stream two blockbuster movies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a>, but original films weren&#8217;t a strong point.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Things are looking brighter for the fall. Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#8217;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="1">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#8217;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#8217;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="33" data-v9y="1">Facebook&#8217;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron sought to reassure users Wednesday that the company doesn&#8217;t have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">impending plans</a> to shift its business toward NFTs.</p>
<p>In a tweet earlier this week, Citron shared an image of crypto wallet MetaMask integrated into Discord&#8217;s user interface with the text &#8220;probably nothing&#8221; — shorthand language in the NFT space for something that&#8217;s about to be a big deal. He contextualized the previous tweet Wednesday evening, noting that Discord has &#8220;no current plans&#8221; to integrate crypto wallets into its app.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for all the perspectives everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we&#39;re focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Discord also provided the following statement clarifying its plans to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate all the perspectives we’ve been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet earlier this week and want to clarify we have no plans to ship it at this time. We’re excited about the potential for web3 technology and the positive ways these communities are coming together on Discord, especially those organized around environmentally friendly, creator-focused projects. However, we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now we&#8217;re focused on protecting users from spams, scams and fraud.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Citron casually shared the screenshot Monday in a reply, not as an official company announcement, but passionate Discord users immediately jumped on the tweet. The company quickly explained that the screenshot was part of a community hack week project and not something around the corner for the social chat app, but the horse had left the barn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord users wary of the crypto space quickly encouraged each other to ditch their Nitro subscriptions, Discord&#8217;s paid premium service that helps the platform stay ad-free. As the backlash spread, outraged Discord fans also pointed to a <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1457751651465449475%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F11%2F09%2Fdiscord-nfts-metamask-crypto%2F">recent poll</a> from the company asking for their thoughts on Web3 and NFTs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7DwAetRZxi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">NFTs and crypto wallets could be in Discord&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFTs and crypto wallets could be in Discord&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/embed/#?secret=7DwAetRZxi" data-secret="7DwAetRZxi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the screenshot was only a pre-release mockup of what crypto wallet integration might look like, Discord was indeed actively exploring how blockchain technology could complement its existing mission. Now, some of that work will go on pause as Discord reevaluates how to best keep its values aligned with the communities that have built bustling home bases on the platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh No <a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe">pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jason Scott (@textfiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some Discord users chalked their strong reactions to the Citron&#8217;s tweet up to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. Others more broadly objected to &#8220;NFT bros.&#8221; But even within Discord&#8217;s many NFT communities, users expressed concerns that integrated crypto wallets would only exacerbate rampant crypto scams on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancel your nitro immediately and select other &#8211; cite the CEO&#8217;s tweet about it as your reasoning why,&#8221; one tweet with 20,000 likes stated. &#8220;A loud, immediately public drop in revenue is the only thing that will change it at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citron&#8217;s clarification makes it clear that Discord is listening to its community, and while many NFT projects do call the platform&#8217;s servers home, a vocal part of Discord&#8217;s user base evidently doesn&#8217;t want the company to touch the crypto business with a ten-foot pole.</p>
<p>While no company likes backlash, the negative reaction to Discord&#8217;s nascent crypto interests does signal just how much the company&#8217;s users enjoy its product in its current iteration. All social media users are afraid of change — just check the tweets around any minor Instagram UI tweak — but Discord&#8217;s users appear particularly keen to protect the product they have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk has sold about $5 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a slew of regulatory filings that posted late Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial filings showed Musk had <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0000899243-21-041857/index.html">sold 934,091 shares</a> for about $1.1 billion out of more than 2.1 million options he received as part of a compensation package. Musk disclosed in a regulatory filing that he sold some of his stake to satisfy tax obligations related to exercising stock options. The CEO is facing income tax on stock gains that were awarded in 2012 at the $6.24 per share price. Musk is taxed on the income between the exercise price of $6.24 and the value of the share when it was sold. The shares were sold at prices between about $1,100 and $1,200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filings that posted later Wednesday revealed Musk sold another 3.58 million shares in Tesla. That sale is valued at about $4 billion. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The stock sales followed a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1457064697782489088%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F11%2F08%2Felon-musk-stock-twitter-poll-taxes%2F">Twitter poll</a> last weekend that asked his followers whether he should sell 10% of his stock, in which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/elon-musk-stock-twitter-poll-taxes/">57.9% voted for and 42.1% voted against</a>. However, at least some of these shares — specifically the options — had a pre-set sale date that had been established weeks before the Twitter poll.</p>
<p>The stock sales news isn&#8217;t exactly surprising. Musk has already said that he would sell a large block of his Tesla stock publicly before, and the SEC filing reveals that Musk was already planning to sell the stock on September 14, making his show on Twitter just that — a show. In addition, during a conversation with tech journalist Kara Swisher in September, Musk said a large portion of his stock options would expire in August 2022 and more or less promised to sell them in Q4.</p>
<p>Musk still holds 166.9 million Tesla shares.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, tons of food ends up in landfills because of cosmetic issues (they won’t look nice in stores) or inefficiencies in the supply chain. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.thetreedots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TreeDots</a>, which says it is the first food surplus marketplace in Asia, wants to help. The company is focused on creating a vertically integrated supply chain with a B2B marketplace and a social commerce feature for group buying by consumers. It is also developing its own cold-chain logistics infrastructure to help food reach end users more quickly. TreeDots announced today that it has raised an $11 million Series A led by Amasia and East Ventures, with participation from investors including Active Fund, Seeds Capital, author Nir Eyal and actress Fiona Xie.</p>
<p>The funding, which brings TreeDots’ total raised to $15 million, will be used to grow its operations in Malaysia, where it expanded last year, enter other markets and continue optimizing its logistics and supply chain business, called TreeLogs. The startup says its gross merchandise volume (GMV) has grown more than 4x year-over-year.</p>
<p>TreeDots was founded in 2017 as a surplus food marketplace for F&amp;B businesses, before it expanded its business to include social commerce, too. About <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/why-is-one-third-of-food-wasted-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of food produced in the world</a> is never eaten. In Asia specifically, TreeDots&#8217; team says this is usually because of inefficient supply chains or aesthetically “imperfect” foods. For example, a grocery chain might reject a chicken that is too big or has a broken bone. But F&amp;B businesses like restaurants usually don’t care how their ingredients look, because they cook and plate food before it reaches the customer. TreeDots’ surplus food marketplace was originally created to sell food to F&amp;B businesses at up to 90% cheaper than other suppliers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231976" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Alibaba rival Pinduoduo is investing in agritech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/embed/#?secret=xFPKVGZKb6" data-secret="xFPKVGZKb6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an email, TreeDots co-chief executive officer Tylor Jong explained that the company does not redistribute food from retailers. “Instead, we solve the food loss problem further upstream where you have food that is imperfect due to various cosmetic standards set by different groups of buyers (businesses, but ultimately driven by consumers) and food that is in surplus, as most countries want to ensure that all varieties are accessible and therefore keep more inventory than needed at every step of the supply chain.”</p>
<p>For suppliers, the benefits of selling food to TreeDots include earning incremental revenue and saving the money they would have spent to send surplus products to landfills. TreeDots also helps them digitize their operations through its app and onboard to TreeLogs. The logistics infrastructure was built using a combination of in-house and external services to fulfill demand from social commerce and business buyers, Jong said. It improves on traditional cold-chain logistics by “being tech-driven and striving for higher utilization, heavier delivery density and best practices,” he added.</p>
<p>In a statement about its investment in TreeDots, East Ventures managing partner Roderick Purwana said, “Food loss is already a trillion dollar problem, but what got us excited was the fact that suppliers started to use the system for all of their revenue, not just food loss products. If one of their trucks could make a delivery to a zone, TreeDots could make five deliveries on that same trip working across suppliers. The increased network density allows for decreased logistics costs and lower emissions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric light-duty truck manufacturer Lordstown Motors has officially sold its 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown, Ohio factory to Foxconn, the Taiwanese hardware manufacturing company best known for making Apple&#8217;s iPhone. The $230 million deal is expected to close by the end of April next year, according to a statement from Lordstown.</p>
<p>The terms of the deal are in line with the agreement in principle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/lordstown-motors-in-talks-to-sell-its-6-2m-square-foot-factory-to-taiwans-foxconn/">the two companies entered into on September 30</a>, after which Foxconn promptly bought $50 million in common stock directly from Lordstown at $6.8983 per share. Foxconn is now on the hook for a $100 million down payment by November 18 and subsequent payments of $50 million in both February and April before the final close targeted for April 30, 2022.</p>
<p>Foxconn also agreed to pursue a contract agreement with Lordstown to help the struggling EV company manufacture its Endurance pickup truck, according to a statement from Lordstown. The two parties will also pursue a joint venture to co-design and develop commercial fleet vehicle programs for North American and international markets. Finally, once the deal is done, Foxconn will get 1.7 million warrants to buy Lordstown common stock at $10.50 per share for the next three years. Lordstown will keep its electric motor production line and battery module and pack assembly lines.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">Foxconn signed an agreement with electric car startup Fisker</a> to co-develop and manufacture its new vehicle under Fisker&#8217;s PEAR program in North America. Foxconn has since signaled that Fisker&#8217;s vehicles will also be produced at the Ohio factory, which Lordstown had purchased from General Motors back in 2019. With this factory purchase, Foxconn gets its first automotive factory and a big shot at expanding beyond the manufacturing of phones and laptops.</p>
<p>Lordstown, which is under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice after a research firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">accused the company of faking EV truck pre-orders</a>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">combating financial woes</a> as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">loss of many executives</a>, including president Rich Schmidt, who resigned on Wednesday morning. This deal could help Lordstown reduce its raw material and component costs. Foxconn has a strong supply chain network, logistics capabilities and purchasing powers needed to help reduce production costs and handle a volatile supply chain. Foxconn is also an expert at software-hardware integration, which is very important for electric vehicles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Going public will enable Brivo to go after more M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart building technology company Brivo reached an agreement to go public via special purpose acquisition with Crown PropTech Acquisitions. The SPAC deal values Brivo at $808 million.</p>
<p>Once the merger closes in early 2022, the combined company will operate as Brivo and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BRVS.”</p>
<p>Steve Van Till, founder and CEO of Brivo, will lead the combined company. Brivo was founded in 1999 and sells SaaS building access management services and connected devices to enterprise and property owners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Van Till told TechCrunch that the proptech boom has accelerated adoption of cloud-based technologies in the industry over the past five years. That has driven the company to be able to tout itself as “the single largest access control system in the world,” working with over 44,5000 customer accounts across over 300 million square feet of commercial property in 42 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brivo had been looking at both SPAC and IPO, and once it was in the private equity markets, “the SPAC offers came rolling in,” Van Till said.</p>
<p>He noted that the SPAC option yielded the company larger amounts of capital and was the more attractive option for what the company wanted to do in the long term, which included M&amp;A opportunities. The company has already been dabbling in M&amp;A, having acquired Parakeet, a keyless entry system company, in March 2020.</p>
<p>“The SPAC also gives us more access to capital, and from a customer perspective, more visibility,” Van Till said. “One of the markets we are moving into is the enterprise market, and we are dealing with other public companies as customers. Being a public company will enable them to see us as a peer.”</p>
<p>The SPAC company, Crown PropTech Acquisitions, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210211005947/en/Crown-PropTech-Acquisitions-Announces-Closing-of-276-Million-Initial-Public-Offering-Including-Full-Exercise-by-Underwriters-to-Purchase-Additional-Shares">raised $276 million in a February IPO</a>. It is led by Richard Chera, chairman and CEO.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 10, 2021! I spent the bulk of today on a train being whisked up the Eastern Seaboard back home, which meant that I was reading novels instead of tech news. And that means I am also catching up today. Thank gosh TechCrunch wrote a zillion stories for us both. We have work to do! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/"><strong>Rivian’s IPO revs Wall Street:</strong></a> The public-market debut of electric vehicle company Rivian stormed to a per-share price north of $100 today after pricing its shares at $78. TechCrunch reports that the company’s valuation makes it worth more than GM or Ford, storied automakers with global footprints, and, well, revenues. Something that Rivian has not that much of. The return of high-risk IPOs is really, truly here.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">Expensify’s CEO talks public debut:</a> </strong>TechCrunch caught up with Expensify founder and CEO David Barrett today to discuss his company’s public offering. We wanted to know why he chose a traditional IPO and just how big his company’s market is (Airbase and others are waging war on one another to snag share). More on the company’s economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Public investors struggle to grok crypto:</a> </strong>Shares of Coinbase are lower today in the wake of its Q3 earnings report. Despite warning investors that its trading incomes would drop in the period, Wall Street was still let down by its numbers. In short, public-market investors appear to be struggling to properly estimate how well crypto-focused companies will perform quarter to quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> is a busy man. He’s busy getting his robotics-focused newsletter ready for launch — it’s called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">Actuator</a> and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up here</a> for free. And he wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">huge feature for the site on Bowery</a>, which plays in the vertical farming space. So, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/vertically-farmed-wasabi-arugula-isnt-a-hypothetical/">had him on the Equity podcast</a> to chat farming that is more tall than broad.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232425" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/new-venture-fund-aims-to-become-the-investment-and-innovation-arm-of-the-autism-community/">Meet the Autism Impact Fund:</a> </strong>A new venture capital fund wants to “revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing, treating and living with autism” through investing. It wants to put capital to work in products and companies that may have a positive impact on the larger autism community. Which sounds pretty cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/subscription-carbon-offsetting-platform-ecologi-hits-8m-total-raised-includes-general-catalyst/"><strong>Now you can subscribe to trees:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, this is not a cannabis joke. A startup called Ecologi is building a subscription service that lets consumers pay regular fees to help plant lots of trees. Trees consume carbon, of course, changing the global climate balance. It just raised $5.75 million. Trees as a service! TaaS!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/momentum-announces-5m-seed-to-automate-sales-tasks-in-slack/"><strong>There’s still white space in sales tooling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson I am taking away from Momentum’s $5 million seed round. The company is building a Slack integration that wants to bring the sales processes closer to other parts of an org. Which is ambitious, given that a CRM giant now <em>owns </em>Slack.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/cacheflow-drops-stealth-tag-raises-6m-to-simplify-the-saas-buying-experience/"><strong>Cacheflow leaves stealth, announces $6M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The SaaS buying experience is old-fashioned, Cacheflow reckons, giving it a shot at shaking up how customers pay for software. The startup, announcing itself to the world for the first time today, is offering a way for software companies to get paid all at once, while allowing customers to pay ratably.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/controlup-nabs-100m-to-monitor-and-improve-desktop-computing-performance-across-disparate-work-environments/"><strong>Mega-round #1:</strong></a> ControlUp has raised a $100 million round to continue scaling its IT-focused service that helps improve desktop performance.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/workato-storms-to-a-5-7b-valuation-after-raising-200m-for-its-enterprise-automation-platform/">Mega-round #2:</a> </strong>Workato has raised $200 million to help enterprise customers automate more of their regular work. The company is now worth $5.7 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/daily-grabs-another-40m-so-developers-can-add-video-audio-features-to-any-product/"><strong>Daily raises $40M for its video-focused software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I recall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">when Daily raised a $4.6 million seed round</a>. That was back in May 2020. Now the company is flush with a new eight-figure round that our own Christine Hall notes will help the company continue to build and sell its API-delivered video embed service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/moov-an-online-marketplace-for-used-manufacturing-equipment-raises-41m-from-tiger-global-and-others/"><strong>Tiger likes Moov’s moves:</strong></a><strong> </strong>So it put a $41 million Series A into the company. What does Moov do? It has built a marketplace for used manufacturing equipment. Given the role that used IRL tooling is playing in the global chip shortage, the company could be onto something major.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/digital-restaurant-startup-zak-orders-up-new-capital-on-mission-to-be-toast-of-latam/"><strong>Latin American Toast is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not the burned bread, but the Toast model. Toast, a U.S. software and hardware and payments company, has soared in value in recent quarters. Zak wants to bring a similar business to Latin America. And it has raised $15 million to do so.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage, TechCrunch wrote about how <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/how-african-refugees-used-bitcoin-to-build-their-own-grassroots-economy/">the eruption of a volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo led to the displaced using bitcoin to rebuild their lives</a>.</strong> It’s a story worth reading.</li>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-discusses-the-future-of-work-and-the-one-thing-hed-do-over/">In an expansive interview,</a> Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook looked back at how the travel company has adapted since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their chat covered topics as far afield as Airbnb&#8217;s &#8220;work anywhere&#8221; policy, how it&#8217;s addressing liability issues for hosts and his biggest regret from the COVID-19 era:</p>
<blockquote><p>I overrode the host cancellation policy and refunded more than a billion dollars of guest bookings. I think it was the right thing to do. But I did it unilaterally, without consulting the hosts. They got really pissed off and it broke some trust with some of our host community.</p></blockquote>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/youtube-is-removing-the-dislike-count-on-all-videos-across-its-platform/">YouTube gives bad vibes the boot:</a> </strong>Alphabet’s video giant YouTube is pulling dislike counts from view across its service. The goal is to prevent abuse, which makes some sense. It’s a bummer that humans are such regular jerks that this is a needed product move, but here we are.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/twitter-is-building-a-crypto-team/"><strong>Twitter is building a crypto team:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Given how much Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey loves bitcoin — over and above other blockchains, which is a subject for another day — it is not a surprise that his social media company is building a crypto team. Twitter has previously tinkered with NFTs and crypto tipping.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/"><strong>Instagram wants to help you use it less:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Users of the Meta-owned social service can now enable reminders to stop scrolling after a set time period. Recall that Meta is Facebook but under a new moniker.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/apple-introduces-device-management-solution-aimed-at-small-business/"><strong>Apple builds SMB hardware service:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Keeping hardware up to date and safe is no small challenge. That’s why companies like Jamf are in business. But now Apple is rolling out “the beta of a device management solution called Apple Business Essentials aimed squarely at businesses with less than 500 employees.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/google-fails-to-overturn-eus-e2-42bn-shopping-antitrust-decision/"><strong>Google fails to get rid of huge EU settlement:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The U.S. search giant’s challenge to a huge fine stemming from a 2017 case with the European Union over its shopping product has largely failed.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Zero-party data has very quickly become the biggest buzzword in marketing and digital advertising. Unlike third-party data, which is collected by aggregators and ad platforms through third-party cookies and unsavory tracking techniques, <a href="https://www.octaneai.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-zero-party-data-marketing-for-ecommerce-merchants">zero-party data</a> is collected voluntarily and directly from customers.</p>
<p>Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family — size, style, skin concerns, gender, budget, taste profile, eating habits, what type of pet they have, etc. That’s zero-party data.</p>
<p>Zero-party data marketing started when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/the-downfall-of-ad-tech-means-the-trust-economy-is-here/">the scrutiny on ad tracking ramped up</a>, but became a necessity with iOS 14.5. With the vast majority of users opting out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">data tracking on iOS</a>, marketers need new sources of data to power their campaigns and replace the data they currently borrow from tracking cookies — which will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">also go away in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This is especially true as more consumers <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005287/en/Personalize-or-Perish-New-Data-from-Twilio-Segment-Shows-Customer-Loyalty-Hinges-on-Personalized-Experiences">demand personalized experiences</a> from the places they shop. Implemented correctly, zero-party data marketing allows you to treat every customer as an individual, personalize their experience with your brand and build real relationships.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>While a lot of articles have discussed the importance of zero-party data, very few have gone into how to collect this valuable data and properly leverage it for better conversions, loyalty and customer satisfaction. That’s why I decided to write this piece. Think of it as a miniguide on how to begin your journey as a zero-party data marketer.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some of the most important tools for zero-party data collection.</p>
<h2>Quizzes and recommendations are the backbone of zero-party data</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232097" style="width: 1112px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232097" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232097 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png" alt="An example of a quiz to help customers buy a product" width="1102" height="278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1102px) 100vw, 1102px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane AI</p></div></p>
<p>When you hear &#8220;quiz,&#8221; you might be tempted to think of a BuzzFeed-style personality assessment, but in reality, they are the fundamental way we figure out what products we want to buy and what package to get.</p>
<p>Think about entering a cosmetics store. You know you need some collection of skincare products, but you don’t know which routine to follow or all the possible options for each part of the routine. A store associate does, however, and they usually help you find the right skincare routine and products based on a series of questions they ask about your skin’s condition, concerns, allergies and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>
<p>This episode of TechCrunch Live will also feature the TCL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can come on our virtual stage and pitch their products to our esteemed guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PST/3 p.m. EST, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackshark.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/meet-the-startup-that-helped-microsoft-build-the-world-of-flight-simulator/">the Austrian startup</a> behind the digital globe you fly over in Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator, has raised a $20 million round A to develop and scale its replica-Earth tech. The potential applications for a planetary &#8220;digital twin&#8221; are many and various, and the company has a head start even on mapping giants like Google.</p>
<p>The world got a glimpse of a fully traversable and remarkably (if not 100%) accurate globe in Flight Simulator last year; we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/">called it a &#8220;technical marvel&#8221;</a> and later went into detail about how it was created and by whom.</p>
<p>Blackshark.ai was spun out of gaming studio Bongfish with the intention, founder and CEO Michael Putz told me, of taking their world-building technology beyond game environments. The basis of their technique is turning widely available 2D imagery into accurate 3D representations with machine learning, a bit of smart guesswork and a lot of computing power.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The details are here, but essentially the Blackshark.ai system has a canny understanding of what different buildings look like from above, even in suboptimal lighting and incomplete imagery. The machine learning system they&#8217;ve built can extrapolate from imperfect outlines by considering the neighborhood (residential versus commercial), roof type (slanted versus flat) and other factors like the presence of air conditioning units and so on. Using all this it creates a plausible 3D reconstruction of the building.</p>
<p>The hard part, of course, isn&#8217;t how to do that <em>once</em> but how to do it <em>a billion times on a regular basis</em>, in order to create an up-to-date 3D representation of every building on the planet. As Putz explained: &#8220;Even if you could afford to buy all the computing power for this, building the back end to serve it is hard! This was a real-world issue we had to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7DADSF9--0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, as is often necessary for AI-powered services, was to optimize. Putz said that the process of calculating the 3D model for every building on the planet originally took about a month of computation but now can be done in about three days, an acceleration of about 300x.</p>
<p>Having this ability to update regularly based on new imagery from satellites is crucial to their business proposition, Putz explained. A lot of 3D map data, like what you see in Google and Apple&#8217;s maps, is based on photogrammetry, aerial photography combining multiple aerial images and comparing parallax data (like our eyes do) to determine size and depth. This produces great data … for when the photo is taken.</p>
<p>If you want your 3D map to represent what a block in Chicago looked like <em>last week</em>, not two years ago, and you want to provide that level of recency to as much of the globe as possible, the only option these days is satellite imagery. But that also necessitates the aforementioned 2D-to-3D method.</p>

<p>Putz noted that although the Blackshark.ai 3D map and those from Google and Apple have superficial similarities, they&#8217;re not really competitors. All provide a realistic &#8220;canvas,&#8221; but they differ greatly in intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google Maps is the canvas for local businesses,&#8221; he said, and what&#8217;s important to both the company and its users is locations, reviews, directions, things like that. &#8220;For us, say for flooding, a climate change use case, we provide the 3D data for say, Seattle, and others who specialize in water physics and fluid simulation can use the real world as a canvas to draw on. Our goal is to become a searchable surface of the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232359" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232359" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232359" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg" alt="A digital recreation of a hillside with simulated windmills and data on their operations." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveData_windmill_HD.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232359" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blackshark.ai</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the total flat rooftop area available in this neighborhood of San Diego? What regional airports have an open 4,000-square-meter space? How do wildfire risk areas overlap with updated wind models? It&#8217;s not hard to come up with ways this could be helpful.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of those ideas where the more you think about it, the more use cases come up,&#8221; Putz said. &#8220;There&#8217;s obviously government applications, disaster relief, smart cities, autonomous industries — driving and flying. All these industries need synthetic environments. This wasn&#8217;t just like, &#8216;Hey we want to do this,&#8217; it was needed. And this 2D-3D thing is the only way to solve this massive problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $20 million round was led by M12 (Microsoft&#8217;s venture fund) and Point72 Ventures. Putz was excited to have a few familiar advising faces aboard: Google Earth co-founder Brian McClendon, former CEO of Airbus Dirk Hoke and Qasar Younis, former Y Combinator COO and now CEO of Applied Intuition. (These folks are <em>advising</em>, not <em>joining</em> the board, as this paragraph mistakenly had earlier.)</p>
<p>Scaling is more a matter of going to market rather than building out the product; while of course more engineers and researchers will be hired, the company needs to go from &#8220;clever startup&#8221; to &#8220;global provider of 3D synthetic Earths&#8221; in a hurry or it may find some other clever startup eating its lunch. So a sales and support team will be built out, along with &#8220;the remaining pieces of a hyperscaling company,&#8221; Putz said.</p>
<p>Beyond the more obvious use cases he listed, there&#8217;s a possibility of — you knew it was coming — <em>metaverse</em> applications. In this case however it&#8217;s less hot air and more the idea that if any interesting AR/VR/etc. applications, from games to travel guides, wanted to base their virtual experience in a recently rendered version of Earth, they can. Not only that, but worlds beyond our own can be generated by the same method, so if you wanted to scramble the layout of the planet and make a  new one (and who could blame you?) you could do so by the end of the week. Doesn&#8217;t that sound nice?</p>
<p>Once the new funding gets put to use, expect to see &#8220;powered by Blackshark.ai&#8221; or the like on a new generation of ever more detailed simulations of the complex markets and processes taking place on the surface of our planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ample, a startup developing battery swapping technology for electric vehicles, has scored another $30 million from The Blackstone Group and Spanish multinational financial services company Banco Santander.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company should be at or near unicorn status, considering its valuation back in August was $890 million, according to PitchBook. Unicorn status means a company that is valued at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The bulk of this round came from The Blackstone Group, who provided $25 million, with Banco providing the remainder. Ample has raised $260 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ample’s concept is relatively straightforward: instead of an EV pulling up to a charging station to get more power, the company proposes outfitting vehicles with Ample’s modular battery packs, which can be swapped out at dedicated stations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ample landed a partnership with Uber to use the company&#8217;s battery swapping stations at a few locations in the Bay Area. Both companies have agreed to extend their partnership to Europe, where Uber aims to electrify half the rides that are booked across seven European capitals — London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and Lisbon — by 2025.</p>
<p>Ample co-founder John de Souza told TechCrunch in a statement that the funding will go toward scaling operations. &#8220;In order to deploy tens of thousands of vehicles in the near future, we will need to expand our production, deployment and support functions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Geographically we will be expanding into Europe next year. The need for scale is being driven both by the market demand and also by the urgency of moving to EVs that was clearly highlighted at COP26.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ample also scored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">a partnership with Sally</a>, an EV rental company based in New York City, to deploy the startup’s swapping service across San Francisco, NYC, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taken together, the two initial partnerships — Uber and Sally — reflect the startup’s focus on fleet companies, for whom time spent recharging an EV battery is time wasted. Ample sees battery swapping as a good solution for individual consumers as well, especially those like apartment dwellers who may not have reliable access to overnight charging, the company has told TechCrunch in the past.</p>

<h2>Sight Tech Global December 1</h2>
<p><strong>Designing for Everyone: Accessibility and Machine Learning at Apple<br />
</strong>Apple’s iPhone and VoiceOver are among the greatest breakthroughs ever for accessibility, but Apple never rests on its laurels. The next wave of innovation will involve what’s known as “machine learning” (a subset of artificial intelligence), which uses data from sensors on the phone and elsewhere to help make sense of the world around us. The implications for accessibility are just starting to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing AI: What Happens When You Combine Computer Vision, Lidar and Audio AR?<br />
</strong>The latest features in Microsoft’s Seeing AI app enable the app to recognize things in the world and place them in 3D space. Items are literally  announced from their position in the room; in other words, the word “chair” seems to emanate from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro’s lidar sensor. And that’s only the start.</p>

<p><strong>W3C ARIA-AT: Screen readers, Interoperability and a New Era of Web Accessibility<br />
</strong>Who knew that screen readers, unlike Web browsers, are not interoperable. Web site developers don’t worry about whether their code will work on Safari, Chrome or any other browser, but if they take accessibility seriously they have to test for JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA and the rest. That’s about to change, thanks to the W3C ARIA-AT project.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed December 2 by a live breakout session with King and Fairchild, as well as several other members of the W3C ARIA-AT team.)</p>

<p><strong>The “Holy Braille”: The Development of a New Tactile Display Combining Braille and Graphics in One Experience<br />
</strong>Today, instant access to the written word in braille is much less available to someone who is blind than the printed word is for someone who is sighted. Tools such as single line refreshable braille displays have been available for years, but a single line at a time gives the user a very limited reading experience. This limitation is especially felt when users are reading lengthy documents or when they encounter content such as charts and graphs in a textbook. The American Printing House for the Blind (APH) and HumanWare have teamed to develop a device capable of rendering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics on the same tactile surface. Currently referred to as the Dynamic Tactile Device (DTD), this tool aims to provide blind users with a multi-line book reader, tactile graphics viewer and so much more.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed by a live breakout Q&amp;A session with Greg Stilson, head of APH’s Global Technology Innovation team, and HumanWare’s Andrew Flattres, Braille Product Manager.)</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Navigation: Can Inertial Navigation, Computer Vision and Other New Technologies Work Where GPS Can’t?<br />
</strong>Thanks to mobile phones, GPS and navigation apps, people who are blind or visually impaired can get around outdoors independently. Navigating indoors is another matter.</p>
<p>For starters, GPS IS often not available indoors. Then there are the challenges of knowing where the door is, finding the stairs or avoiding the couch someone moved. Combining on-phone and in-cloud technologies like inertial navigation, audio AR, lidar and computer vision may be the foundation for a solution, if product developers can map indoor spaces, provide indoor positioning and deliver an accessible user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Why Amazon’s Vision Includes Talking Less to Alexa<br />
</strong>As homes become increasingly more technology-driven, inputs from multiple sources — teachable AI, multimodal understanding, sensors, computer vision and more — will create a truly ambient, surround experience. Already, one in every five Alexa smart home interactions is initiated by Alexa without any spoken command. As Alexa develops an understanding of us and our home well enough to predict our needs and act on our behalf in meaningful ways, what are the implications for accessibility?</p>

<p><strong>Inventors Invent: Three New Takes on Assistive Technology<br />
</strong>Inventors have long been inspired to apply their genius to helping blind people. Think of innovators like Mike Shebanek (VoiceOver, Apple) or Jim Fruchterman (Bookshare, Benetech), to name just two. Today, innovators have a nearly miraculous array of affordable technologies to work with, including lidar, computer vision, high-speed data networks and more. As a result, innovation is moving ahead at a dizzying pace. In this session, we will talk to three product innovators on the forefront of turning those core technologies into remarkable new tools for people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Product Accessibility: How Do You Get it Right? And How Do You Know When You Have?<br />
</strong>Accessibility awareness is on the rise, but even teams with the best of intentions can flounder when it comes to finding the right approaches. One key is to work closely with the appropriate communities of users to get feedback and understand needs. The result is not trade-offs but a better product for everyone. In this session, we’ll hear from experts on the frontline of accessibility in product development.</p>

<p><strong>For Most Mobile Phone Users, Accessibility Is Spelled Android<br />
</strong>Nearly three-quarters of mobile phone users in the world use phones built on Google’s Android operating system, not Apple’s iOS on the iPhone. For people who are blind or have low vision, the key app is Google’s Lookout, which draws on the vast resources of Google’s AI infrastructure, including its computer vision database and Google maps. How is Google approaching the huge accessibility opportunity Lookout represents?</p>

<p><strong>Getting around: Autonomous Vehicles, Ridesharing and Those Last Few Feet<br />
</strong>Summoning a ride from a smart phone is a dream come true for many, but when you have difficulty finding that ride, even when it’s a few feet away, the experience can be a nightmare, not to mention dangerous. How are rideshare and autonomous taxi companies working to make those last few feet from rider to car safer and better for blind and low-vision riders?</p>
