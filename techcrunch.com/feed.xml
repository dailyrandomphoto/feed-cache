										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s painful to watch SPAC deals collapse post-combination. You can viscerally feel dreams melting away to disappointment as founders, employees and investors still holding shares in the newly public entities watch their wealth dwindle.</p>
<p>The mess is not sector-specific. Media? Not a good SPAC target. Insurtech? Nope. 3D printing? Not looking good. E-scooters? Nerp. Hardware and software for apartment buildings? Not that either. Fintech? A mixed bag, but with some pretty poor results as well.</p>

<hr />
<p>SPACs did manage to get a number of startups and unicorns public more quickly than they might have managed on their own. But the results are proving to be pure trash so frequently once the hype has died down and real, post-debut life begins that I would hazard that we&#8217;ve collected enough data to call the SPAC boom a failure.</p>

In that SPACs will not become the chariots that help transport enough unicorns across the private-public market divide and begin to cut down on the rising number of pricey former startups collecting by the exits of Startup Land. The results are just too icky for that to work out.</p>
<h2>The unicorn pileup</h2>
<p>One of the most quietly pressing issues in technology investing today is the fact that the number of unicorns continues to grow, year after year. This is to say that the pace at which venture capitalists and other private-market investors can take companies public is far slower than the rate at which they can generate paper wealth. North of 900 unicorns are waiting for an exit, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/unicorn-leaderboard-privately-held/488c2557-4d5a-4c25-8bd3-61c519f07508/identifiers">Crunchbase counting 944</a> and <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">CB Insights landing on a slightly higher figure of 959</a>.</p>
<p>The result is that several <em>trillions</em> of dollars of value are sitting on the sidelines of the capital markets, waiting to be called into the game. And SPACs had a shot at helping.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adelaide-based startup <a href="https://www.fertil.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fertilis</a> is the latest to join a wave of companies worldwide that are trying to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) less stressful and more successful for patients and clinicians.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Fertilis&#8217;s technology to automate cell culture with micro medical devices has won support from some investors. Horizons Ventures, the venture capital firm of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing and an early investor in Facebook and Spotify, recently led Fertilis&#8217;s seed round of AUS$2.75 million ($1.98 million). Other investors were not disclosed.</p>
<p>In 2019, the percentage of IVF treatments that led to a live birth <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was merely 32%</a> for women under 35, according to the U.K.&#8217;s National Health Service. Factors like patients&#8217; age and the quality of sperms and eggs can affect success rates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254924" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A flurry of startups has been working to improve embryo selection, such as Israel-based Embryonics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/this-startup-says-its-ai-can-better-spot-a-healthy-embryo-and-improve-ivf-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which we covered</a>. Fertilis, founded by reproductive biologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-thompson-6a111a17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Thompson</a> and serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martygauvin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Gauvin</a>, is tackling the problem from a different angle &#8212; embryo incubation.</p>
<p>An IVF clinic is &#8220;a very busy place&#8221; where professionals &#8220;are trained in everything they have to do,&#8221; Thompson said in an interview with TechCrunch. A standard IVF process involves transferring cells to different environments in a petri dish as an embryo develops. But from retrieving the egg, carrying the petri dish across the lab, to putting the embryo in the reproductive tract, &#8220;there are all sorts of things that can go wrong,&#8221; the biologist suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time an embryo gets picked up by a clinician, the environment is negatively affected,&#8221; Thompson remarked. &#8220;The hopes and dreams of the patients are literally in every step [the clinician] takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fertilis&#8217;s solution is to standardize and automate the IVF process by putting each embryo in its patented 3D-printed cradle. The device, with the width of a hair, allows for culturing of cells in environments that &#8220;more closely resemble the environment of the human body,&#8221; Thompson said. The cradles will then go onto a petri dish, so clinicians won&#8217;t need to handle the embryo directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2255456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fertilis-4.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In the regulatory world for reproductive technology, Fertilis sits in a unique position. Because it&#8217;s producing a medical device that acts on cells rather than humans, regulations it faces are more &#8220;straightforward in some countries,&#8221; said Gauvin. The company is currently seeking FDA approval.</p>
<p>Fertilis&#8217;s new funding will support its ongoing scientific development. It plans to start clinical trials globally late this year, with an agreement in place to conduct trials with a fertility clinic in California; it is also talking to partners in Europe and Asia with agreements expected to be signed in the coming months. By 2023, the startup aims to introduce its first commercial product.</p>
<p>Technically, Fertilis&#8217;s grain-size devices can be used to culture other types of cells. Fertilization is just its starting point.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Fertilis&#8217; technology will have a transformative impact on a wide range of healthcare applications that ranges from diagnostics and treatment to the creation of specific cell culture products,&#8221; said Chris Liu, Horizons Ventures&#8217; Australia-based investor.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Turo income statement, once we beat back some non-cash costs muddying its bottom line, has me impressed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer car-sharing company Turo <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed to go public</a> last night. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/">first look at its S-1 filing is here</a>, in case you missed it.</p>
<p>That Turo has filed to go public is not a surprise. After <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/turo/company_financials/funding_rounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising nearly $500 million while private</a>, the company has an enormous capital base underneath it, meaning that there is also institutional pressure for the firm to pursue an IPO. Turo first raised external capital back in 2009, Crunchbase data indicates, so some investors have been waiting for the company&#8217;s S-1 filing for a long, long while.</p>

<hr />
<p>The good news is that Turo&#8217;s business had a turnaround year last year. After posting somewhat lackluster 2020 results, Turo saw its revenues and results rebound, at least through the third quarter. We&#8217;ll get Q4 data in a subsequent S-1 filing.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This morning, I want to compare and contrast the company&#8217;s 2020 and 2021 results as a way to show how some unicorns will come out of the pandemic with jets on. Frankly, the Turo income statement, once we beat back some non-cash costs muddying its bottom line, has me impressed.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about acceleration post-lockdown.</p>
<h2>Turo&#8217;s financial rebound</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, Turo recorded slim revenue growth. The company&#8217;s top line grew from $141.7 million to $149.9 million, or around 6%. For a venture-backed company ramping toward an IPO, that&#8217;s an incredibly thin pace of growth.</p>
<p>Even worse, the company&#8217;s net losses stayed essentially flat during the period, decreasing just a smidge from $98.6 million worth of negative net income in 2019 to $97.1 million in 2020.</p>
<p>But then, 2021 came around. Observe the differential in results:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256130" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256130 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png 827w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=768,350 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=680,310 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-8.52.23-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Turo S-1</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see when we contrast the first three quarters of 2020 with the same portion of 2021, the company&#8217;s revenue growth reignited, and it swung from stinging operating losses to operating profits. It appears that last year was a rebirth of sorts for Turo &#8212; it left slow growth behind for hyper-growth (207% between 2020 and 2021, for the periods listed) and losses for profits (on an operating basis).</p>
<p><em>Yes but,</em> I can hear you saying,<em> the company&#8217;s net loss actually got worse in the first three quarters of 2021 when compared with the preceding year. Why are we giving it plaudits for growth when it torched so much money? </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every company has to decide what to pay their employees and track that compensation in some way, often in spreadsheets and across disparate payroll, finance and HR systems. Companies also need to ensure that they are paying people with comparable experience a similar amount for the same job.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemble.inc/">Assemble</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to bring organization to this process, and today it announced a $5 million seed investment from Susa Ventures, Goldcrest Capital and several industry angels.</p>
<p>Assemble co-founder Enrique Esclusa said that the startup has created a system of engagement for compensation decisions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a system that assembles all that compensation and workforce data in one central location that usually lives in disparate systems, and then makes it not only accessible but actionable and easy to understand for various stakeholders across the company,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Esclusa and his co-founder, Lisa Wallace, worked together at another company where Wallace was in charge of hiring and Esclusa managed finance and business operations. It was there that they learned firsthand just how hard it was to track this type of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we realized was that virtually everything lived in spreadsheets, which is a really painful and time-consuming way to put all this data and frameworks together, share the right information with people who are making decisions across the company, and make decisions that not only were competitive enough so that you could hire folks and attract them and retain employees, but also were financially responsible and fair and equitable,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So in 2020, the two founders got together and decided to do something about it, and built a product to address the issues they experienced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Wallace said that companies typically don&#8217;t consider equity in a direct way as they build an organization, then go back and try to fix it, a process that requires consultants to pull the information from various systems. Assemble is designed to build equity into the compensation system from the start.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about running a pay equity analysis in one place, or providing one-off visibility to managers in another place. It&#8217;s about truly having a layer of engagement across your organization that works from multiple stakeholders that are touching compensation because there are so many different stakeholders and so many different objectives, and it&#8217;s really easy to go off the rails,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Assemble. currently has 10 employees, and with a diverse founding team and a DE&amp;I mission around pay equity, they are working to build a diverse and inclusive company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made a pretty concerted effort for each rec that we&#8217;ve opened to interview and evaluate diverse candidates. … It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really focused on, and Enrique and I spend about a third of our time recruiting,&#8221; she said, adding that while they only have the 10 employees so far, their diversity numbers are fairly good on a number of metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re 40% Hispanic as a company and 60% of us are immigrants or the children of immigrants,&#8221; she said. While just two of the current 10 employees are women, Wallace said that&#8217;s something she&#8217;s working to address in future hires. She said that the company is also working on diversity on the funding side by bringing in a number of historically underrepresented angel investors into the cap table.</p>
<p>Since compensation doesn&#8217;t live on its own inside an organization, Assemble works in conjunction with HR and payroll software tools like WorkDay, Gusto, ADP and Bamboo HR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A brewing scandal over the alleged historical use of controversial mobile spyware by Poland&#8217;s ruling party against an opposition lawmaker is raising questions over the legitimacy of the country&#8217;s 2019 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Internet watchdog Citizen Lab found that the NSO Group&#8217;s notorious spyware Pegasus was used to spy on three critics of the Polish government. One of the targets was named Krzysztof Brejza, a member of the Polish Senate whose phone was hacked dozens of times ahead of parliamentary elections in 2019.</p>
<p>Text messages stolen from Brejza’s phone were doctored and aired by state-controlled TV as part of an apparent smear campaign in the run-up to the election. Brejza&#8217;s left-leaning political coalition, Civic Platform, subsequently lost the country&#8217;s 2019 parliamentary election by a close margin. Brejza <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-software-spyware-jaroslaw-kaczynski-0c41a504e8fbdbb6b9b06f6869848a48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Associated Press</a>, which first reported the hacks, that the election was unfair since the ruling party would have had access to his campaign&#8217;s plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255632" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Polish government previously denied that it has used Pegasus, a mobile spyware that gives its government customers near-complete access to a target’s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and precise location.</p>
<p>Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland&#8217;s Law and Justice party and the country&#8217;s deputy prime minister, rebuked accusations that the Polish government used the Pegasus spyware to monitor its political opposition, but told <a href="https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/580785-kaczynski-dla-sieci-o-pegasusie-opozycja-opowiada-bzdury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polish media</a> last week that it &#8220;would be bad&#8221; if the Polish security services did not have access to mobile spying technology while other countries did.</p>
<p>Polish media reports that the government purchased Pegasus in 2017 using money from the so-called Justice Fund, which is supposed to help victims of crimes and rehabilitate offenders.</p>
<p>Amnesty International late last week independently <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/01/poland-use-of-pegasus-spyware-to-hack-politicians-highlights-threat-to-civil-society/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verified</a> that Brezja&#8217;s phone was hacked.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We urgently need governments to implement a global moratorium on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards are in place.&#8221;<br />
<cite>Likhita Banerji, Amnesty International</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the Associated Press and Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings “fake news” and claimed a foreign intelligence service could be to blame. Critics dismissed the government&#8217;s allegation, arguing that no other government would have any interest in the three Polish targets.</p>
<p>The other two Polish targets confirmed by Citizen Lab are Roman Giertych, a lawyer who represents opposition politicians in a number of politically sensitive cases, and prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek. Apple began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/apple-nso-hacking-notify/">notifying phone spying victims</a> in December after it sued NSO to block the spyware maker from using any of Apple&#8217;s technologies, which would make it significantly harder for NSO to hack its targets.</p>
<p>Pegasus is known to be used by authoritarian governments like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda and the United Arab Emirates to spy on journalists, politicians and human rights defenders. But new reporting last year revealed several European Union states, including <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-admits-to-using-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/a-59726217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungary</a>, are Pegasus customers, as is now Poland.</p>
<p>Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk — the new leader of Civic Platform since October 2021 — has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the government&#8217;s use of Pegasus. Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal member of the European Parliament for Renew Europe, told TechCrunch that the allegations must be investigated to get a full picture of how the Polish government is using Pegasus.</p>
<p>“But what we do know is deeply worrying,” he said. “This is obviously a threat to both the rule of law as well as free and fair elections — and therefore both to EU rules as well as the integrity of the European Union. If that’s not enough for a full European investigation, what is?”</p>
<p>When reached, an unnamed spokesperson for NSO Group declined to confirm or deny its customers but added: &#8220;The use of cyber tools in order to monitor dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools. The international community should have zero tolerance policy towards such acts, therefore a global regulation is needed. NSO has proven in the past it has zero-tolerance for these types of misuse, by terminating multiple contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amnesty International, which called the findings “shocking, but not surprising,” is also calling for the European Union to implement targeted sanctions against NSO Group, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">much like the U.S. government has done</a>.</p>
<p>“This shows, yet again, that the unchecked use of Pegasus is a threat to not just politicians, but to civil society around the world. So far not enough has been done to reign in unlawful targeted surveillance,&#8221; Likhita Banerji, a researcher and advisor at Amnesty International, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We urgently need governments to implement a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/doc10/4516/2021/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global moratorium</a> on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards are in place.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The firm is targeting capital at early-stage investments in enterprise, consumer, hardtech, fintech and healthcare companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleiner Perkins</a>, one of Silicon Valley’s legacy venture capital firms, is kicking off 2022 right by celebrating five decades in business and $1.8 billion in funds raised for two new funds — KP20 and Select2.</p>
<p>KP20 is an $800 million venture fund focused on early-stage investments in enterprise, consumer, hardtech, fintech and healthcare companies, while Select2 is a $1 billion fund — the most the firm has raised at once — that extends its core investment strategy to focus on high inflection investments across those same five areas.</p>
<p>Select2 follows the <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/kleiner-perkins-select/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$750 million Kleiner Perkins Select</a> fund the firm announced last April.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255931" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Partner Ilya Fushman told TechCrunch that the firm’s focus is the same today as it was when Kleiner Perkins started in 1972: “Venture is a non-scalable, boutique craft that requires incredibly dedicated practitioners with diverse and complementary backgrounds that span technology, operating and investing.”</p>
<p>With a history of being early investors in technology darlings, like Google, Amazon, Netscape and Genentech, Fushman said the investor team curated over the past four years is taking over the next generation of the firm, while the new funds will be able to back the next generation of iconic companies, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2255933" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255933" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255933" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png" alt="Kleiner Perkins" width="1024" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Investor-team-picture.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255933" class="wp-caption-text">Kleiner Perkins&#8217; investor team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kleiner Perkins</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the funds, Kleiner Perkins promoted several team members as new partners: Annie Case, a consumer marketplaces and digital health expert, and Josh Coyne, who leads investments in business software.</p>
<p>Case told TechCrunch that within the digital health space, she is seeing more investment going into mental and behavioral health and alternative medicines, while on the consumer side, there is a lot happening in education technology, mainly due to school districts and parents adapting to the experience of teaching during the global pandemic. The firm is also spending more time looking at opportunities in crypto and web3.</p>
<p>As for raising $1.8 billion in one go, Fushman says Kleiner Perkins is adjusting to the current conditions where companies are not only growing bigger and faster, but also growing across sectors, technology and internationally. The scale of opportunity is bigger than ever before, and that is reflected in exit valuations and the number of companies that get started each year.</p>
<p>And having more fund capital at the firm’s disposal enables the company to deploy it into later rounds, or with a bigger check to get in, and still be able to provide a similar venture assistance Kleiner Perkins is known for in the early stage.</p>
<p>“The market overall for venture makes it an exciting time to grow beyond early-stage and provide a full spectrum of capital,” Fushman said. “As we help companies grow, if we see them hitting an inflection or we miss out on the Series A, we can do something from the Select fund.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="http://www.partnersi.co.kr/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Partners Investment</a> and <a href="http://murexpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murex Partners</a> co-led the new funding, with participation from Smilegate Investment, <a href="http://quantumepk.com/index_en.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantum Ventures Korea</a>, <a href="http://www.abc-partners.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC Partners</a>, Everrich Group, GS Group&#8217;s corporate venture capital firm <a href="https://www.gsfutures.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GS Futures</a>, We Ventures, Base Investment and <a href="https://dunamupartners.com/?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunamu &amp; Partners</a>. Previous backers Mirae Asset Venture Investment, Mirae Asset Capital, Partners Investment and Timewise Investment also participated. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AmazeVR has raised a total of $30.8 million since its inception in 2015 and plans to raise a Series B in early 2022 to drive its rapid growth, the company said. Co-CEO of AmazeVR Ernest Lee told TechCrunch that the startup would use the fresh capital for hiring additional headcount. AmazeVR began 2021 with 12 employees, but now the company has tripled its team in Hollywood and Seoul, with 41 employees, Lee noted.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255453" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We’ve been able to attract top talent from the [music, entertainment, tech and gaming] industries we touch,” Lee said. “This puts us in an ideal position to take full advantage of VR and the metaverse’s growing popularity, as we deliver breathtaking VR concerts from major artists, first to theaters, then to homes worldwide.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the wake of social media, fans have unprecedented access to their favorite artists but are still separated by a screen. VR concerts by AmazeVR take the fan across the screen to come face-to-face with their favorite artists to create a human connection, </span>Lee said. Users would join as avatars, hang out with other users, and experience VR concerts together.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our goal is for the technology to be so good that it becomes invisible so that the fan’s memory is not that of a great VR experience, but it’s that they actually came face to face with their favorite artists in fantastical immersive environments, blurring the lines of reality,” Lee said in an interview with TechCrunch. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lee said that AmazeVR has been developing VR technologies since 2015 and pivoted fully into VR concerts in late 2019. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company believed in the need for a more immersive music experience through VR concerts even before the pandemic; however, the music industry felt a bit distant and skeptical, largely from a concern over cannibalization of live concerts, their most lucrative revenue stream, Lee said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More recently, the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the adoption in the market, allowing AmazeVR to find product-market fit quickly. As the music industry also became more open-minded about new technologies, people began to realize that VR concerts are not live concerts but a new category of entertainment, Lee continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The music industry is due for a paradigm shift, and many companies have been trying to innovate the next big thing. The pandemic only accelerated this shift as we’ve seen many endeavors spanning from livestreams to virtual concerts to Fortnite shows,” Lee told TechCrunch. “All of these other solutions only provide incremental value from what already exists, and no other solution truly captures the cover value for fans &#8212; a human connection.” </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AmazeVR is rolling out its first commercial VR concert with 3X Grammy winner Megan Thee Stallion to tour select AMC Theatres across the U.S. this spring. Lee told TechCrunch that the company has already secured its second artist, a global A-list artist, and is finalizing the third artist. Its first VR concert tour springs from years of R&amp;D that resulted in proprietary 9K cameras and software that can automate complex unreal engine-based VR concert visual effects (VFX) modules and run more than 100 headsets at a time. The startup plans to scale its content creation, releasing new VR concerts weekly by 2024 to both in-theater and at-home viewers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“You really need to experience our VR concerts to get a full grasp of how impactful they are. VR can finally blow all 2D experience out of the water. Thanks to our technology, we can evoke a real sense of presence you can’t get from a screen, the feeling that your favorite artist is right here, face to face with you,” Lee said. “This opens up a new dimension for music, one of the first new ways for artists and fans to connect since recordings appeared. We’re thrilled that investors are grasping this and are supporting us as we innovate and grow.” </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Foxtrot is reimagining the convenience store experience by seeking out the best food items by local artisans along with its core offerings of coffee, ready-to-eat cafe meals and wine. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.foxtrotco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxtrot</a> is changing the way we think about convenience stores, and just picked up $100 million in new Series C funding to expand its brick-and-mortar footprint to 50 new retail locations in the next two years.</p>
<p>We last looked in on Chicago-based Foxtrot in early 2020, just before the world was shook by the global pandemic. It had secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/foxtrot-picks-up-17-million-to-reimagine-the-convenience-store/">$17 million in a growth round</a> and was offering customers the option to buy in-store or order online for delivery and had retail stores in Dallas and Chicago.</p>
<p>The company, founded by Mike LaVitola and Taylor Bloom in 2014, is reimagining the corner convenience store. Its origins are as a digital-first commerce platform, but went on to add a retail experience. It is now seeking the best food items by local artisans in addition to Foxtrot’s core offerings of coffee, ready-to-eat cafe meals and wine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After the previous round, Foxtrot added Washington, D.C. to its market list and has since opened 16 retail locations across those three cities. Its offerings include five-minute pickup, rapid and on-demand delivery and its Foxtrot Anywhere nationwide shipping tool.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Foxtrot picks up $17 million to reimagine the convenience store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/foxtrot-picks-up-17-million-to-reimagine-the-convenience-store/embed/#?secret=wqZ486fTFS" data-secret="wqZ486fTFS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, the company got into private label products a year ago, which now account for about 30% of its retail offerings and nearly half of its retail and e-commerce sales, CEO LaVitola told TechCrunch. He expects some 200 new private label products to be launched over the next year.</p>
<p>Today’s new fundraise was led by D1 Capital Partners, which was joined by existing investors Monogram Capital, Imaginary, Almanac, Wittington, Fifth Wall, Beliade, Lerer Hippeau and Revolution. The Series C gives Foxtrot total funding of $160 million.</p>
<p>As we saw with the pandemic, most sales shifted online; however, LaVitola noticed that traffic into Foxtrot’s retail locations went up, noting that it was a less intense way of discovering a new snack food and “became a 20-minute joy in people’s routines” versus going into a restaurant or grocery store.</p>
<p>The company doubled its business last year, and the adoption of the retail store is also one of the drivers for the company to use the new funds to open 25 new stores in 2022. New locations will include Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood, the debut of two stores in Austin and additional Chicago openings — Willis Tower, Tribune Tower and near Wrigley Field. In 2023, Foxtrot will take that farther into new markets, like New York, Nashville and Miami, while also expanding its footprint across current cities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The biggest trend we have seen is customers fully leaning into the retail experience and for that to be the main customer acquisition point for the online business,” LaVitola said. “Delivery is here to stay, but customers are ultimately seeing the value of our merchandise. As a result, we are spending 90% of our time on that in-person experience, obsessing over who has the best donuts, coffee or tortillas.”</p>
<p>In addition to the retail locations, Foxtrot is investing the new capital into scaling its merchandising model, hiring additional engineering talent with plans to triple the team’s size in the next year. LaVitola also expects to hire in logistics, store payments, inventory management, personalization and Perks, Foxtrot’s loyalty program.</p>
<p>Perks itself has grown more than 110% in 2021, while its five-minute market pickup and cafe orders grew 250% and 375%, respectively, in the same time period.</p>
<p>Jared Stein, co-founder of Monogram Capital and a Foxtrot board member, called Foxtrot a “category killing model” in the way it’s been able to dominate as an omnichannel brand and local product curator.</p>
<p>“Foxtrot, in our minds, is rare,” he added. “They built their tech stack from the ground up, and it is hard to find another company with the same level of curation and local partnership with interesting brands. That is a reason for people to come into the story. Others are doing this, but with complications. Foxtrot worked on that before scaling it out.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's technology makes it easier for companies to create demonstration videos, called “arcades,” that walk people through how their tools work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so many apps and tools out there to try, most companies ask you to fill out a standard form and then create a username and password. Once you get through all of that, you find that the app was not all it was cracked up to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arcade.software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcade</a> is out to change that. The interactive demo company, which launched to the public today, is making it easier for companies to create demonstration videos, called “arcades,” that walk people through how their tools work.</p>
<p>Former Atlassian co-workers Caroline Clark and Rich Manalang are behind the company, which also announced $2.5 million in seed funding led by Upfront Ventures, with participation by Sequoia and a group of angel investors, including Mathilde Collin, Laura Behrens Wu, Jaren Glover, Eric Wittman, Jay Simons, Jonathan Widawski and Lenny Rachitsky.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255874" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Clark and Manalang founded the company in early 2021 and launched it in private beta form last July. It has about 300 on the waitlist so far. Among them, 90 companies started using a free version of the product and have created more than 125 arcades so far.</p>
<p>Arcade remembers what you click on so users can make a version of their demo and then embed snippets of the product into websites, blogs and tweets so that people who haven’t used the product before can see it before signing on for a trial.</p>
<p>Clark, who has a marketing background, told TechCrunch that while she and Manalang were at Atlassian, which she says pioneered the concept of product-led growth, they found that many customers were discovering their products outside of the website. The problem was, they didn’t see a solution for how to make those discoveries better.</p>
<p>“We wanted to create a world where people discovered products in an easy and playful manner that clearly showed what they were getting,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 60.708333333333336%; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://demo.arcade.software/aazSbZ8zlbEwYGhzmFSu/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>Customers have always had expectations of products and tools they are buying, but Clark said in the past couple of years, that mindset has shifted to one where they will no longer blindly sign up.</p>
<p>Historically, selling involved hiding behind the demo, and once the company got the person’s information, it was more of a “gotcha” moment. One of Arcade’s customers, Clockwork, which works with financial professionals, often asks potential users to connect their invoices to the product so users can see how Clockwork operates, but that is a big ask, Clark said. By utilizing Arcade, Clockwork is able to give potential customers a taste of what their platform is like without uploading that data. Carta is another customer that is deploying arcades across its social media, Clark said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Arcade to build out its product and website as it also looks to add more engineering and product designers. Clark says the team of three have been supporting 90 companies, but she wants to double that by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Going forward, the company is focused on marketing, functionality and distribution.</p>
<p>“We are about helping people know what they are getting into before they load their data,” Clark said. “We plan to invest more in product updates, integration into other properties and how customers can make a more powerful tool.”</p>
<p>Aditi Maliwal, partner at Upfront Ventures, said via email that Clark was a friend that she had known for a couple of years and is &#8220;excited to go on a five- to 10 year- — if not longer — journey with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a values driven, intellectually honest founder,&#8221; Maliwal added. &#8220;I invest in strong founders, who I believe have founder-market fit and are building an authentic vision. I knew from very early on that no matter what Caroline was building I would want to invest in it. The PLG market is also growing so quickly, and our worlds are almost entirely virtual at this point. The idea of getting on a Zoom or a call with a sales rep in order to try out a vendor&#8217;s product feels disruptive to a users&#8217; needs and flow. It should be much easier to for users to simply see an instance of their data on a vendor&#8217;s landing page. Arcade is empowering creators to develop magical experiences and for them to feel proud of their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the get-go Maliwal believes the founders were both focused on finding design partners who could convert into full-time customers. When they worked at Atlassian, they saw first-hand how powerful showing your product to your prospects and customers can be, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They understood the pain point very early on and recognize that differentiation comes down to delight in design and keeping it as simple as possible for marketers and for end-users,&#8221; Maliwal said. &#8220;Finally Caroline and Rich are both invested in building a massive company, starting with a design forward product and a high quality team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.banknovo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo</a>, the startup building a new kind of banking service from the ground up for small and medium businesses, has closed a significant round of funding to take the next step in growing its platform. It has raised $90 million, a Series B round that values the Miami-based startup at $700 million, funding that it will use to build out its infrastructure (going from 24,000 customers to 150,000 is no small feat); to add in new products, specifically around lending; and to acquire more customers.</p>
<p>There are a number of fintechs, some that describe themselves as challenger banks, in the market today catering to SMBs. (We&#8217;ve covered many of them; they include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brex</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/rho-raises-75-million-series-b-for-its-one-stop-corporate-spend-and-cash-management-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rho</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/juni-a-vertical-neobank-for-e-commerce-and-online-marketing-companies-raises-21-5m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juni</a>, <a href="http://northone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NorthOne</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lili</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/mercury-banks-20m-for-its-banking-service-aimed-at-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/uks-anna-raises-21m-for-its-smb-focused-business-account-and-tax-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uks-tide-raises-14m-to-challenge-big-banks-with-a-mobile-first-service-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tide</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/greeces-viva-wallet-raises-80m-for-its-neo-bank-targeting-small-business-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open</a> and many more; and you could argue Amazon, offering other money management and spending tools, is also in the space.) But Novo sees incumbents as the real &#8220;challenger&#8221; here.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are competing against big banks. They are the only ones we are concerned with because they own 99% of the market,&#8221; said Michel Rangel, CEO of Novo, in an interview earlier this month. &#8220;We believe our product is better value for businesses, but we&#8217;re happy to see others also pushing the charge forward.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Stripes, with Valar Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Rainfall Ventures, and BoxGroup &#8212; all of whom backed Novo in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series A</a>, just six months ago &#8212; also participating. The startup to date has raised just over $135 million.</p>
<p>A lot of startups are getting into patterns of raising large funding rounds in rapid succession to ride their respective waves of growth, and to capitalize on the huge opportunity right now to tap deep-pocketed investors looking for smart places to put their LPs&#8217; money. That is very much the case here with Novo, too. The company has seen truly accelerated growth in the last year, and specifically the last six months, both in terms of customer numbers and in terms of how much its app is getting used.</p>
<p>Novo now has 150,000 SMB customers in the U.S., up by 50,000 on last June&#8217;s figures. And Novo has collectively now seen $5 billion in lifetime transactions, up by $4 billion on last June&#8217;s $1 billion. The company said that as of this month, it&#8217;s on track to see lifetime transactions for 2022 grow to $7 billion (although given it&#8217;s only January, that figure is likely to change).</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic was a catalyst for our growth,&#8221; said Rangel, who co-founded Novo with <span class="s2">Tyler McIntylre, who is now the CTO. Rangel </span>noted that this Series B came on the back of Stripes approaching Novo &#8220;at the tail end of its Series A&#8221; after the term sheets had already been signed. Watching its growth after that &#8220;validated&#8221; another quick round of funding, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One thing that is very notable about Novo is that, unlike a number of other neobanks, it has not taken the &#8220;embedded finance&#8221; approach by porting in a number of basic services by way of APIs built by third parties that focus just on infrastructure and backend services. Instead, it decided to build its central functions from the ground up in-house. (It has a large development team, mostly based out of India, Rangel told me.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We say everything starting from the underlying core processor that powers the bank to what is in the hands of our 150,000 business customers has been built in house,&#8221; Rangel said. (Middlesex Federal Savings handles the banking license, FDIC insurance, and access to rails for Novo.) Rangel added that its choice to build was partly done out of necessity, since in 2016 there weren&#8217;t many banking-as-a-service platforms to provide those APIs. &#8220;That has unshackled us from someone else&#8217;s release schedule, and it means tighter margins,&#8221; he continued, but it does have its challenges, for example, in sometimes keeping product focus, and the investment needed to continue maintaining all that technology.</p>
<p>The company also hasn&#8217;t entirely opted out of APIs. Between its Series A and this latest round, the company launched a new Marketplace where it provides APIs for some 1,000 other apps and services that can be integrated into the Novo experience. Here, it focuses on features that sit otutside of the core functionality of a banking service, for example point of sale payments, e-commerce operations, invoice and payroll management and more. This, in fact, can also potentially provide a steer to Novo on what might be most popular and potentially worth considering as in-house products in the future, but for now it serves another couple of key purposes: it makes Novo more useful for its customers, and it provides more data sources to Novo to build future products.</p>
<p>Chief among those, Rangel said, will be a new lending product where loan applications will be evaluated quickly and (the hope is) more accurately by bringing in and considering a wider set of data that gives a more informed picture of how a business is operating. This is not unlike how, for example, Stripe and Shopify have built their own cash advance and credit products; the difference here is that Novo is intentionally aiming to source as much siloed data as possible to have the most complete picture of a business&#8217;s financial health.</p>
<p class="p7">This is not just about providing more accurate loans, but more of them overall.</p>
<p class="p7">“Despite being the heart of the U.S. economy, the more than 30 million small businesses in the U.S. have always struggled to access even basic financial services as they are constantly overlooked by the big banks,” said Saagar Kulkarni, a partner at Stripes, in a statement. “What sets Novo apart is a fundamentally different approach to helping small businesses succeed. Instead of opting for incremental change, Novo built its banking platform from the ground up so that it could not just deliver a great digital banking experience, but actually deliver de novo financial products to a customer base that is yearning for them. At Stripes, we only invest in companies building amazing products, and Novo’s rave reviews, strong retention, and incredible growth make it clear it has built something that small businesses love.” Kulkarni is joining Novo&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p class="p5">As the company continues to grow, Rangel said one other area it will be considering is picking up potential smaller players that fit with its bigger strategy. That&#8217;s if it doesn&#8217;t get acquired itself first. Rangel said it has been approached by at least one significant player in recent years but decided to stay solo. (That may have been for the best for other reasons, too: that company has since been acquired itself, one of the byproducts of changing tides due to the pandemic.)</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We&#8217;ve done the acquisition dance,&#8221; Rangel said, &#8220;but I think we&#8217;ll be the ones doing the acquiring now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Deskless&#8221; workers have become a big focus for tech companies looking for new opportunities in the B2B market, and today a startup targeting this segment with e-learning tools is announcing a round of funding to fuel its own growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://edume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EduMe</a>, a London startup that provides online corporate training and education in the form of &#8220;microlearning&#8221; modules that companies build themselves &#8212; aimed at fast-scaling tech businesses and others dealing with large numbers of workers or partners that typically do not work in the same physical location as the business itself &#8212; has picked up $20 million in a Series B round. The company plans to use the funding to expand its business in the U.S. after seeing a decent amount of growth to date.</p>
<p>Prosus and <a href="https://ventures.workday.com/">Workday Ventures</a> (Workday&#8217;s strategic investment arm) co-led the round with Valo Ventures, which led EduMe&#8217;s Series A, also participating. The Workday investment is notable because it shows that the HR platform is eyeing up how it might be doing more in corporate learning and targeting deskless workers in particular (both would be natural complements to its current platform), and this could well lead, more widely, to some M&amp;A down the line for it. Meanwhile, EduMe sees opportunities for growth in making e-learning easier to use in a wider IT context.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The ecosystem of how you serve the deskless worker is changing,&#8221; said Jacob Waern, CEO and founder of EduMe, in an interview. &#8220;They don’t want to have ten apps, and so we are looking to integrate with CRM platforms and others to deliver connected content to workforces.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Prosus, this is one of many bets it&#8217;s putting into edtech: today it also announced it was leading a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/gostudent-raises-340m-series-d-funding-round-as-it-pushes-into-international-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big round for online tutoring platform GoStudent</a>, targeting younger, consumer users.</p>
<p>EduMe&#8217;s focus on deskless workers, a market that was once sidelined but has now become mainstream, mirrors the startup&#8217;s own DNA.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.millicom.com/media-center/features/june-mlearning-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally hatched at Millicom</a>, a telco that focuses on emerging markets (currently in Latin America; historically both LatAm and Africa), with the service originally intended to provide e-learning to the telco&#8217;s customer base. Over time, Waern (who was at Millicom and built the service there) saw that it was getting the most traction with businesses, not consumers nor sole-traders, and so the decision was made to spin out the business to double down on that opportunity across a wider set of markets that also included developed countries. (Millicom has no stake in EduMe, Waern said.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EduMe found early users among target verticals like ridesharing and delivery companies, which were scaling fast and needed ways to communicate with those disparate teams. Over time it also added companies in logistics, mobile network operators, retail, hospitality and healthcare. It now has around 60 global customers currently, including Gopuff, Deliveroo, Deloitte, Uber and Vodafone. EduMe is not disclosing its total number of users, learning modules used, or other metrics; nor is it discussing valuation.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s growth mirrors what has been a bigger trend in the B2B technology market. Deskless workers traditionally were ignored in favor of the so-called knowledge worker segment &#8212; mainly because knowledge workers, sitting at computers all day, represented an obvious and ready target for buying and using online learning tools. Simply put, it&#8217;s always been easier to build and sell for these users.</p>
<p>All of that has massively changed in the last several years. Most importantly, the evolution has been precipitated by advances in mobile technology and cloud computing, where now everyone (knowledge worker or not) is using a smartphone to get their jobs done, on the back of much faster wireless networks, and with apps that have been designed to be used on the go and on smaller screens.</p>
<p>More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated that shift: remote working is now the norm for everyone, and that has helped to democratize solutions to work for a wider array of people. Waern said his company estimates that in fact some 80% of the world&#8217;s workforce these days could be considered deskless.</p>
<p>The rise of remote working has also fueled the growth of something else. Because people can&#8217;t or simply don&#8217;t work in common physical spaces anymore, online learning tools have become a central &#8212; sometimes the most important &#8212; way for companies to communicate with their teams, using them not just for training, but onboarding and professional development.</p>
<p>The growth of this trend has translated into very big business. It&#8217;s estimated that the bigger market for corporate learning was valued at $250 billion in 2020. That is set to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/13/2262081/0/en/Global-E-Learning-Market-to-Reach-457-8-Billion-by-2026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">balloon to nearly $458 billion by 2026</a>, accelerated growth brought on by the pandemic and longer term changing business and consumer habits.</p>
<p>EduMe believes that its unique selling point in the market right now is its focus on remote and deskless employees, but it&#8217;s far from being the only player in this space, and so it will face heavy competition. Other startups that have raised big rounds to fuel their own corporate learning ambitions include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/corporate-learning-platform-360learning-raises-200-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">360Learning</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/dublins-learnupon-raises-56m-for-its-online-learning-management-system-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LearnUpon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/go1-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-boost-its-curated-enterprise-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go1</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/norwegian-corporate-training-startup-attensi-raises-26m-from-nycs-lugard-road-dx-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attensi</a>. LinkedIn also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizeable interest in this space</a>.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has changed the way we work in ways we could have never imagined, and with that there’s an immense need to support the fast-growing industries where employees may not have a traditional desk,” said Mark Peek, managing director and head, Workday Ventures, in a statement. “We support EduMe because of its innovative training and learning platform that helps organizations navigate change and grow while serving an ever-expanding deskless workforce.”</p>

<p>That makes $669M raised since GoStudent was founded in Vienna in 2016, giving it a notional $3.5BN / €3BN valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement, Felix Ohswald, Co-Founder and CEO of GoStudent said: “Education has seen a whirlwind of change, from remote classrooms to increased academic ambitions, and we believe there is a big opportunity to transform how students learn all over the world by expanding access to quality education.”</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for international expansion, product expansion through M&amp;A, and increased market share in existing geographies, said the company.</p>
<p>Fahd Beg, COO, Prosus EdTech, said: “GoStudent has built a highly scalable business offering a superb customer experience. The company is creating a leading global platform for K12 education and the speed at which they are growing is impressive. We are living through a time when technology is transforming education globally and the inspiring vision of founders like Felix and Gregor will reshape how students learn in the future.”</p>
<p>In 2021, GoStudent expanded to 16 countries, including Canada and Mexico, and opened 19 international office locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it plans to enter a “minimum” of six markets this year, including new regions such as the US, Asia-Pacific, and the MENA region; grow and diversify its range of services through M&amp;A (it acquired the all-in-one school communication app Fox Education in September 2021), and invest in existing regions where tutoring services are “highly fragmented and traditionally offline”.</p>
<p>GoStudent is surfing a wave of interest in EdTech following the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced students into online learning, and subsequently became seen as a much more efficient way to get tutoring (as well as being Covid-safe). In addition to GoStudent, Kahoot!, the Norwegian gamified learning platform, is another European EdTech unicorn.</p>
<p>After an earlier period of experimentation with business models, GoStudent started to focus more squarely on one-to-one tutoring. It now lets students and their parents pick tutors for general tutoring or specifically with the aim of taking an exam. Tutors are tested, vetted, and interviewed by GoStudent before they can join the platform. That strategy and the pandemic have come together to create a perfect opportunity for the company &#8211; and any other EdTech startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/lions-still-on-the-move-growth-in-africas-consumer-sector"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey &amp; Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on general e-commerce activities in Africa says consumer spending will reach over $2 trillion in the next three years. Much of this spending falls under the importation of products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> influenced by consumer demand and the positioning of major e-commerce platforms in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.afrikrea.com/en">Afrikrea</a>, an Ivorian startup founded in 2016, is one of the few platforms facilitating product exports. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised a $6.2 million pre-Series A round while rebranding to ANKA, the SaaS platform it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/ivorian-startup-afrikrea-partners-with-dhl-and-visa-to-launch-saas-e-commerce-platform-anka/">launched for sellers in partnership with DHL and Visa</a> in April last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moulaye-taboure-78280041/">Moulaye Taboure</a> launched Afrikrea with</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/abdoul-kadry-diallo-a7295b73"> Kadry Diallo</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/luc-b-perussault-diallo-99525519"> Luc B. Perussault Diallo</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a marketplace for Africa-based and -inspired fashion, clothing, accessories, arts and crafts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Afrikrea said it served more than 7,000 sellers from 47 African countries and buyers from 170 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some research, the founders noticed that these sellers also engaged with other channels, such as websites or social media. To them, it made sense to build another platform &#8212; <a href="https://www.anka.africa/">ANKA</a> &#8212; where merchants, with an omnichannel dashboard, can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their sales and inventory across all these channels: Afrikrea, social media and websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other features like a customizable online storefront, payment links, and access to various payment methods and logistics added to the platform’s appeal to Afrikrea merchants. The appeal extended to the company itself, resulting in a name change despite the marketplace recording 250% year-on-year growth since launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The main goal behind that is to reflect our much larger purpose and mission now. And also much larger product offering as we are going to serve not only people in fashion but in every industry where anyone wants to export African products,” CEO Taboure told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afrikrea is now one of the features on the ANKA website. Others include a customized online storefront (like Shopify), which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is linked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sellers’ social media platforms and marketplace channels (such as Stripe, Gumroad or PayPal); access to shipping products with DHL; and receiving payments in various currencies (including a buy now, pay later option).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So wherever you sell, on social media, Afrikrea marketplace, or your website, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it ends up in one dashboard,” the CEO said. “You can manage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your orders and one wallet to get paid and withdraw your money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ivorian startup Afrikrea partners with DHL and Visa to launch SaaS e-commerce platform ANKA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/ivorian-startup-afrikrea-partners-with-dhl-and-visa-to-launch-saas-e-commerce-platform-anka/embed/#?secret=SxwHVvb0Z4" data-secret="SxwHVvb0Z4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA is free to use when sellers fill up their product catalogs or generate payment links</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, once sellers decide to start using the software to accept payments or make a sale, they pay €</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 (~$12) to access the service monthly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, sellers pay €</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 (~$12) upfront for the platform’s shipping or website hosting services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taboure told TechCrunch that about 40% of its over 13,000 subscribers do not use the marketplace. To them, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA serves to generate payment links to use on other channels or fulfill orders from other channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company is building out a mobile application to make the process smoother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having engulfed Afrikrea’s merchant base, ANKA has sellers from 47 out of Africa’s 54 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANKA also mentioned that more than 80% of its sellers are women, who have grown their revenue by 50% on average since joining the ANKA community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also records over 700,000 visits from its buyers who have transacted over $35 million on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, ANKA said these buyers come from 174 countries, the majority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Europe and North America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Taboure, the buyers are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from France and the U.S; they account for 90% of ANKA’s sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past decade, the growth of e-commerce in Africa has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been spearheaded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies like Jumia, Takealot and Mall4Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, MallforAfrica struck a partnership with DHL and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/dhl-launches-africa-eshop-app-for-global-retailers-to-sell-into-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched DHL Africa eShop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the logistics giant four years later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But recent struggles from currency devaluation to investor pullout have forced the startup to <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/11/02/mallforafrica-suspended-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take an extended hiatus</a> (although it claims to be restrategizing), raising fresh questions on the viability of some e-commerce models in Africa. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taboure believes his company is protected from such events because it serves the market the other way round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most e-commerce tried so far has been Africans trying to buy outside. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, when you do that, you have currency and logistics issues that are completely different</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are the opposite. We are trying to have Africans earn in foreign currency. So if I were, to be honest, it’s almost like we operate in two different worlds,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the few startups that are trying not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make Africans spend their money or buy more things. We actually want to help them earn money globally and create value on the global stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this way, we contribute to solidifying our economies in much more than one way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview TechCrunch had with the chief executive last year, he touted ANKA as the largest e-commerce exporter startup on the continent, claiming it ships over 10 tons of cargo per month from Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sorts of numbers make investors’ mouths water &#8212; in ANKA’s case, e-commerce heavyweights like <a href="https://hk.linkedin.com/in/joe-tsai-4a9120102">Joseph Tsai</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alibaba executive and billionaire participated in the round alongside</span> <a href="https://bestseller.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BESTSELLER Foundation</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose chairman is one of the largest shareholders in both ASOS and Zalando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">French VC and Africa-focused impact firm</span><a href="https://www.ietp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Investisseurs &amp; Partenaires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (I&amp;P) led the round. In a statement, its co-CEO, Sebastien Boye, said I&amp;P invested in ANKA because the company is at the heart of his firm’s strategy: talented and ambitious founders, significant growth, value creation and a compelling impact thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include VestedWorld, Enigmo, Groupe Prunay, Rising Tide Africa and SAVIU Ventures, the lead investor in ANKA’s seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/loftyinc-capital-launches-third-fund-at-10m-for-a-more-diverse-portfolio-of-african-startups/">LoftyInc Capital</a> and other local investors back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $8.1 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re pretty happy to have some VCs in the round, but also having entrepreneurs that already did what we did. That’s something that we’re very proud about and very intentional in building the round is we focused on having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the best people at the table to help us grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said the pre-Series A round will help it build out its SaaS mobile infrastructure and further product development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ANKA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also plans to <a href="https://anka.breezy.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire talent</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across tech, finance, sales and marketing to join its 30-person team across four continents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Synthetic data startup MOSTLY raised a $25 million Series B round led by British VC firm Molten Ventures, with participation from new investor Citi Ventures and existing investors 42CAP and Earlybird.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austrian synthetic data startup <a href="https://mostly.ai/">MOSTLY AI</a> today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series B round. British VC firm <a href="https://www.moltenventures.com/">Molten Ventures</a> led the operation, with participation from new investor<a href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/"> Citi Ventures</a>. Two existing investors also returned: Munich-based <a href="https://www.42cap.com/">42CAP</a>, and Berlin-based <a href="https://earlybird.com/">Earlybird</a>, which had led MOSTLY AI&#8217;s <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/03/mostly-ai-raises-5m-in-series-a-funding.html">$5 million Series A round</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Synthetic data is fake data, but not random: MOSTLY AI uses artificial intelligence to achieve a high degree of fidelity to its clients&#8217; databases. Its data sets &#8220;look just as real as a company’s original customer data with just as many details, but without the original personal data points,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>Talking to TechCrunch, MOSTLY AI CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiashann/">Tobias Hann</a> said that the company plans to use the proceeds to push the boundaries of what its product can do, grow its team, and gain more customers both in Europe and in the U.S., where it already has offices in New York City.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255890" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MOSTLY AI was founded in Vienna in 2017, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented across the EU one year later. This demand for privacy-preserving solutions and the concomitant rise of machine learning have created significant momentum for synthetic data. <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/07/24/by-2024-60-of-the-data-used-for-the-development-of-ai-and-analytics-projects-will-be-synthetically-generated/">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2024, 60% of the data used for the de­vel­op­ment of AI and an­a­lyt­ics projects will be syn­thet­i­cally gen­er­ated.</p>
<p>MOSTLY AI&#8217;s typical clients are Fortune 100 banks and insurers, as well as telcos. These three highly regulated sectors drive most of the demand for synthetic tabular data, alongside healthcare.</p>
<p>Unlike some of its competitors, MOSTLY AI hasn&#8217;t put its focus on healthcare in the past, but it could change. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly something that we are watching closely and we are actually starting some pilot projects this year,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>
<p>The democratization of AI means that synthetic data will eventually be used well beyond Fortune 100 companies, Hann told TechCrunch. His company therefore plans to serve smaller organizations and a wider range of sectors in the future. But until now, it made sense for MOSTLY AI to focus on enterprise-level clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the moment, enterprise companies are the ones that have the budgets, need and sophistication to work with synthetic data, Hann said. To match their expectations, MOSTLY AI obtained <a href="https://mostly.ai/news/first-synthetic-data-company-with-iso-certification/">ISO certifications</a>.</p>
<p>Talking to Hann, one thing becomes clear: While the startup has a solid technical footing, it is equally invested in the commercialization of its technology and in the business value it can add for its clients. &#8220;MOSTLY AI is leading this emerging and rapidly-growing space in terms of both customer deployments and expertise,&#8221; Molten Ventures&#8217; investment director Christoph Hornung said.</p>
<p>The need to comply with privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA clearly drives demand for synthetic data, but it&#8217;s not the only factor at play. For instance, demand in Europe is also driven by a wider cultural context; while in the U.S., it also results from a desire to innovate. For instance, use cases can include advanced analytics, predictive algorithms, fraud detection and pricing models – but without data that can be traced back to specific users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many companies are proactively approaching the space because they understand that customers value privacy,&#8221; Hann said. &#8220;These companies understand that they can also gain a competitive advantage when dealing and working with data in a privacy-preserving way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing more U.S. companies wanting to adopt synthetic data in innovative ways is the key reason why MOSTLY AI wants to grow its team in the U.S. But it is also recruiting more generally, both in Vienna and remotely. Its plan is to increase its headcount from 35 to 65 people by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Hann expects 2022 to be &#8220;the year where synthetic data will take off,&#8221; and beyond this year, &#8220;a really strong decade for synthetic data.&#8221; This will be supported by growing demand for responsible AI, articulated around key concepts such as AI fairness and explainability. Synthetic data helps answer these challenges. &#8220;It enables enterprises to augment and de-bias their data sets,&#8221; Hann said.</p>
<p>Machine learning aside, MOSTLY AI sees lots of potential for synthetic data to be leveraged in software testing. Supporting these use cases requires making synthetic data accessible not only to data scientists, but also to software engineers and quality testers. It&#8217;s with them in mind that MOSTLY AI came up a few months ago with version 2.0 of its platform. &#8220;MOSTLY AI 2.0 can be implemented on premise or in a private cloud, and adapts to different data structures of the company using it,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/02/2325471/0/en/MOSTLY-AI-First-to-Bring-Synthetic-Data-to-Software-Testing.html">wrote</a> at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are clearly a B2B software infrastructure company,&#8221; Hann said. Both in its Series A and B rounds, the company looked for investors who understood that approach.</p>
<p>Molten Ventures being a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/why-draper-esprit-doubled-down-on-its-status-as-a-publicly-listed-vc/">publicly listed VC and consequently not subject to typical funding cycles</a> also carried some weight, Hann confirmed when I asked. &#8220;Having this long term commitment from a partner is something that was very appealing to us, because it&#8217;s a little more flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt either that Citi Ventures is the venture arm of Citigroup, and that it is headquartered in the U.S. &#8220;We&#8217;re significantly increasing the team in the U.S., and it&#8217;s always great to also have a U.S.-based investor that can help with network and relationships there,&#8221; Hann said.</p>
<p>With $25 million in new funding and an increased U.S. presence, MOSTLY AI will now have more resources to compete against other companies in its segment of the synthetic data space. These include <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/">Tonic.ai</a>, which raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tonic-ai-raises-35m-series-b-to-help-engineers-create-synthetic-data-sets/">$35 million Series B last September</a>; <a href="https://gretel.ai/">Gretel AI</a>, which disclosed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/gretel-ai-raises-50m-for-a-platform-that-lets-engineers-build-and-use-synthetic-datasets-to-ensure-the-privacy-of-their-actual-data/">$50 million Series B round</a> last October; and <a href="https://hazy.com/blog/2020/01/27/hazy-seed-plus-raise">seed-funded British startup Hazy</a>, as well as players that focus on specific verticals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do see more and more players emerging in the space and in the market in general, so it certainly shows that there&#8217;s a lot of interest there,&#8221; Hann said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest fintech megaround, </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has confirmed that it has raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round that ups its valuation to $12.3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch in October was the first to report that Brex was raising the capital and had achieved decacorn status. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led the financing, which brings the three-year-old San Francisco startup’s total raised to $1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It has gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies. Last April, Brex said it had combined </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit cards, business cash accounts and new spend management and bill pay software “together in a single dashboard” as part of </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called Brex Premium that cost $49 per month. Today, the company is focused on the corporate card product it’s been building since its inception, banking products and expense management products. Or put more simply, it aims to serve as a “financial operating system” for its customers.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest raise follows a year that saw a “more than doubling” of revenue, according to co-CEO and co-founder Henrique </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubugras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declined to reveal hard figures. Existing investors made up about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 95% of those participating in the Series D-2 round, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t open up to new ones because we had so many new investors with deep pockets who we’d promised we’d give more allocation to over the years,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubugras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “They were comfortable that we had hit the targets we said we were going to so that gave us some credibility to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the funding announcement, Brex also announced that it has hired away an exec from Meta (previously known as Facebook): </span><a href="https://twitter.com/_karandeep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karandeep Anand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been named the company’s chief product officer after having led </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta’s business products group, which served more than 200 million businesses globally. Prior to that, Anand spent 15 years at Microsoft, where he led the product management strategy for Microsoft’s Azure cloud and developer platform efforts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exec will lead Brex’s product portfolio expansion efforts, where a good portion of its new capital will be directed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Karandeep is an engineer by background so he is product and engineering-oriented but also business and customer-oriented,” Dubugras told TechCrunch. “He’s a unique hire in that sense, and that’s particularly important for Brex. Our software and card touches most of the employees in a company even though it’s the CFO that decides to buy it. Since we want to provide a consumer-like experience, he’s going to help there.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Anand described Brex as “a market disruptor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opportunity to create economic opportunity for millions of people and businesses globally through innovation in financial products is incredibly exciting,” he said in a written statement. “The opportunity ahead for Brex is expansive, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to create products that will help our customers grow their businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of customers, Brex continues to serve startups or e-commerce companies that might be smaller businesses but with higher growth. As its earlier customers have grown and matured, Brex is now adapting to also serve mid-market to larger businesses which have different financial needs as they grow. This is where it appears Anand will be able to offer the greatest value.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255977" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255977" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255977 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brex.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brex</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape for startups clamoring to meet companies’ financial needs seems to increase by the day. One of Brex’s most well-known competitors, Ramp, is also growing impressively and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August, announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $300 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its move to serve larger and more established companies, Brex seems to only be further encroaching into Ramp’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nell Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, believes Brex has been able to build a card that meets the needs of “modern” businesses and startups. And while that alone was compelling enough to attract his firm’s attention, Greenoaks also saw the broader potential for a “truly extensible platform that could solve a universal set of problems,” including providing better controls over employee spend, “painless” expense reporting and rewards tailored to a company’s specific needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The result is a differentiated experience that shows up in attractive customer loyalty, and some of the best growth metrics we’d ever seen,” he wrote via email. “On top of this, we’ve been consistently impressed with Brex’s team, who build excellent products fast, with a profound vision for the future of business banking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta went on to say that Brex has become the “cognitive referent” for modern business banking. He touted features such as instant onboarding and virtual card provisioning; an “easy to use UX”; no account fees; “compelling” rewards; and technology “that’s built to integrate into its customers’ financial workflows.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think few companies can so effectively serve such a diversity of businesses, from day one startups to sophisticated enterprises with complex needs,” he added. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255974" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255974" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255974 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founders2-e1641861691269.jpg?w=680" alt="Brex confirms $12.3B valuation" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255974" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders and co-CEOs Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi / Brex</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Brex has “built all its technology from scratch” is a big differentiator for the company, according to Dubugras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t use third-party legacy vendors like banks do, and we’re pretty specialized on high-growth businesses,” he told TechCrunch. “A lot of competitors have single line products, but with us, you can do your banking, you can do expense management, you can get a venture debt line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by Pedro Franceschi and Dubugras (who are now in their mid-20s), San Francisco-based Brex was valued at $7.4 billion this April after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $425 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global Management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company told TechCrunch at the time of its last raise that it was “onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.” Brex also said then that it grew its “total customer” figure by 80% in the first quarter of 2021, “with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company expects to have 1,000 employees by month’s end. Because it is still focused on growth, it is not yet profitable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has submitted its compliance plans to allow developers to use third-party payment options in South Korea at a reduced service fee, the Korea Communication Commission (KCC) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The KCC also said it would discuss with Apple to iron out further details, including service fee structures and the exact date when the payment option will go into effect. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The announcement comes after the South Korean authorities requested in October for global app store operators like Google and Apple to turn in detailed plans for the country&#8217;s new law, which bans app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple told the KCC in October that it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">already in compliance with</a> the new law in South Korea, while Google <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">has outlined</a> its strategy in November to provide an alternative payment system on its app store in South Korea in a move to follow the new law, dubbed the “Anti Google law&#8221; </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that took effect in September.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Google said in <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">its blog</a> that it would reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example, developers, who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play’s billing system, would pay 11% through its alternative billing system. </span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s top executive in South Korea, Brandon Yoon, who was in charge of the app store system, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/top-apple-executive-for-south-korea-leaves-amid-app-store-tussle">abruptly left</a> the iPhone maker in early November. According to media reports, Yoon’s leave is not related to the alternative app payment system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In late August 2021, the South Korean parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">has passed</a> the world’s first bill to prevent the global tech giants from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users,” a spokesperson at Apple said.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple said in its statement that the number of app developers operating in South Korea has increased to approximately 580,000, with more than 1.4 million apps available on the Korean App Store since 2008. Through its App Store, Apple has helped Korean developers access markets and customers in nearly 200 countries around the world, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Economies of scale are an essential cornerstone for on-demand companies, and to that end one of the hopefuls in the space has raised a big round to grow its business. <a href="https://bolt.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> &#8212; the startup and app of the same name that operates on-demand ride hailing, shared cars and scooters; and restaurant and grocery delivery &#8212; has raised €628 million ($709 million at current rates), at a valuation of €7.4 billion ($8.4 billion). It will be using the funds to continue expanding to new geographies and to bring more consumers and partners to its &#8220;super app&#8221;; and newer business lines, such as its 15-minute grocery delivery option Bolt Market, will be building out &#8216;dark stores&#8217; in more cities to expand the service beyond the 10 where its active today.</p>
<p class="p12">&#8220;All of our business units are growing,&#8221; founder and CEO Markus Villig said in an interview this week. Villig said that even its most mature business, ride hailing, &#8220;is seeing double digit growth,&#8221; while the newer businesses, being smaller, are expanding even faster. &#8220;The new trend of last year is that private cars are a bad thing and increasingly people want to use other forms of mobility.&#8221; He added that Bolt is working on partnering with more city governments to build out its services as part of their updated transportation strategies.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management and Research Company LLC co-led the round with Whale Rock, Owl Rock (a division of Blue Owl), D1, G Squared, Tekne, Ghisallo, and other unnamed backers also participating.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255548" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding news caps off an eventful few months for the company, which had raised €600 million at a valuation of over €4 billion <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/bolt-closes-a-600m-funding-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only four months earlier</a> in a Series E also led by Sequoia. Bolt now has more than 100 million customers in 45 countries and 400+ cities using its services. As a measure of its growth, in August, when the company announced that previous round, it had 75 million customers.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s growth is also notable considering the difficulties that some of its competitors have been facing in the wake of Covid: first the pandemic had a major chilling effect on people being willing to go into a vehicle where they have to sit in a closed-in space with another person (the driver). That situation was then compounded when things picked up again but so quickly that many services are suffering from a shortage of drivers, not passengers.</p>
<p>Villig admitted that Bolt, too, faced some &#8220;short-term fluctuations&#8221; in demand when the lockdowns first started. But it has made attracting and keeping drivers a major focus by paying out better commissions than its rivals (typically, Villig said, it will pay between 10% and 20% better than competitors).</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a massive lack of supply on these platforms, so we have focused on taking the most partner-friendly lowest commission,&#8221; he said. That has paid off well for Bolt, which has now seen monthly revenues more than double compared to sales pre-Covid, Villig said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bolt was founded eight years ago in Tallinn, Estonia (originally as Taxify), with a mission to bring ride hailing to emerging markets and countries where others like Uber had yet to gain a strong foothold, a strategy that it used to expand modestly across regions like Central and Eastern Europe and Africa, in the process attracting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/chinas-didi-invests-in-taxify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors like China&#8217;s Didi</a> &#8212; itself having built a massive business in its own home emerging market. (Didi <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/08/31/didi-gives-bolt-stake-worth-hundreds-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly divested</a> its stake in Bolt last year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over time, the focus has remained on Europe and Africa, but Bolt found that a lot of its learnings from those first launches could just as easily be applied in more developed countries, with more lucrative payoffs. </span></p>
<p class="p12">&#8220;We started off in Eastern Europe and Africa because those markets had a bigger need. They had lower car ownership, higher unemployment [making for a market with many freelance drivers], It made sense,&#8221; said Villig. &#8220;But now we’ve learned that this model works everywhere, and it’s actually easier to grow in Western Europe because they are developed markets. We found if you can make this model work in really cheap, frugal markets, then once you go to London or Stockholm, it&#8217;s materially easier. And the unit economcis are definitely better because the prices are higher.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a perfect system, though. Working in developed markets, he said, the trade-off is &#8220;more regulations,&#8221; and the limits that come with those.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bolt&#8217;s diversification approach, moving beyond cars to scooters and couriers, and now also food delivery services, is also a part of its scaling strategy. Offering multiple services within a single app not only helps Bolt bring in new customers and cross sell to them, but it does so with essentially zero marketing costs by putting all of the options and cross-promotions within a single app, said Villig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two elements that set us apart and are turning in our favor are the synergies and the shared costs between these verticals,&#8221; he said. Most of Bolt&#8217;s competitors are generally focused on one thing in each app, Villig continued, &#8220;and we are not,&#8221; so it&#8217;s easier and less expensive for Bolt to build more services off the back of each other. &#8220;Now we are passing on those savings for customers.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to deepen our partnership with Markus and Bolt to further their mission to make urban travel affordable, sustainable and safe,&#8221; said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia, in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;At Sequoia, we believe in the global potential for technology and entrepreneurship and have been inspired by Bolt&#8217;s growth from Tallinn, Estonia to over 400 cities and 100 million customers across Europe and Africa. We&#8217;re eager to help them expand their footprint, increase their product offering and improve the quality of life in cities for the long term.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor has sanctioned the European Parliament for a series of breaches of the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules.</p>
<p>The decision sounds a loud warning to sites and services in the region about the need for due diligence of personal data flows and transfers &#8212; including proper scrutiny of any third party providers, plug-ins or other bits of embedded code &#8212; to avoid the risk of costly legal sanction. Although the parliament has avoided a financial penalty this time.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor&#8217;s (EDPS) intervention relates to a COVID-19 test booking website which the European Parliament launched in September 2020 &#8212; using a third party provider, called Ecolog.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The website attracted a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/privacy-complaint-targets-european-parliaments-covid-19-test-booking-site/">complaints</a>, filed by six MEPs, last year &#8212; with the support of the European privacy campaign group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> &#8212; over the presence of third party trackers and confusing cookie consent banners, among a raft of other compliance problems which also included transparency and data access issues.</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the EDPS <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Case%202020-1013%20-%20EDPS%20Decision_bk.pdf">found</a> the parliament was at fault in several respects and it has issued a reprimand &#8212; ordering rectification of any outstanding issues within one month.</p>
<p>The test booking website was found to be dropping cookies associated with Google Analytics and Stripe &#8212; but the parliament failed to demonstrate it had applied any special measures to ensure that any associated personal data transfers to the US would be adequately protected in light of the landmark Schrems II decision by the EU&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>In July 2020, the CJEU struck down the bloc&#8217;s flagship data transfer agreement with the US (aka, the EU-US Privacy Shield) and issued further guidance that transfers of EU people&#8217;s personal data to all third countries must be risk assessed on a case by case basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ruling also made it clear that EU regulators must step in and suspend data flows if they believe people&#8217;s information is at risk. So in order for some transfers to be legal (such as EU-US data flows) additional measures may be needed to raise the level of protection to the required standard of essential equivalence with EU law &#8212; something the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">since issued</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">detailed guidance</a> on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Twv4nukO8J"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/embed/#?secret=Twv4nukO8J" data-secret="Twv4nukO8J" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However &#8212; in the case of the parliament&#8217;s COVID-19 test booking site &#8212; the EDPS found no evidence that it or its provider had applied any such extra measures to safeguard EU-US transfers resulting from the inclusion of Google Analytics and Stripe cookies.</p>
<p>Turns out the provider had copypasted code from another website it had built, for a test centre in the Brussels International Airport &#8212; hence the presence of cookies for payment company Stripe on the parliament site (despite no payments actually being required for testing booked via the website).</p>
<p>Google Analytics cookies, meanwhile, had apparently been included by the provider to &#8220;minimise the risk of spoofing and for website optimisation purposes&#8221;, according to the EDPS&#8217; findings.</p>
<p>Post-<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II</a>, the presence of cookies designed to send data to US-based providers for processing creates immediate legal risk for EU-based websites &#8212; and/or their clients (in this case the parliament was found by the EDPS to be the sole data controller, while Ecolog was the data processor). So incorporating Google Analytics may do the opposite of &#8216;optimizing&#8217; your site&#8217;s compliance with EU data protection law.</p>
<p>That said, enforcement of this particular compliance issue has been a slow burn, even since the 2020 CJEU ruling &#8212; with only a smattering of regulator-led investigations, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">clearest leadership coming from the EDPS itself</a>.</p>
<p>A (very) long running complaint against Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, meanwhile, brought by noyb founder Max Schrems in the wake of the 2013 Snowden disclosures about NSA mass surveillance of social network and Internet data, still hasn&#8217;t resulted in a final decision by its lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) &#8212; despite the latter agreeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/"><em>a full year ago</em> that it would &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize the complaint</a>.</p>
<p>Again, though, that makes the EDPS&#8217; intervention on the parliament complaint all the more significant. tl;dr: EU banhammers are, gradually, falling.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2OeQSwYcpw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=2OeQSwYcpw" data-secret="2OeQSwYcpw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In another finding against the parliament, the EDPS took issue with confusing cookie consent notices shown to visitors to the test booking website &#8212; which it found provided inaccurate information; did not always offer clear choices to reject third party tracking; and included deceptive design which could manipulate consent.</p>
<p>By contrast, EU law on consent as a legal basis to process people&#8217;s data requires is clear that choice must be informed, specific (i.e. purpose limited, rather than bundled) and freely given.</p>
<p>The parliament was also found to have failed to respond adequately to complainants requests for information &#8212; breaching additional legal requirements law which provide Europeans with a suite of access rights related to their personal data.</p>
<p>While the parliament has landed in the embarrassing situation of being reprimanded by the EDPS, it has avoided a fine &#8212; as the regulator only has narrow powers to issue financial penalties which it said these infringements did not trigger.</p>
<p>But the findings of fault by the bloc&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor draw fresh red lines around routine regional use of US-based tools like Google Analytics (or, indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">Facebook Pages</a>) in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Copypasting code with standard analytics calls might seem like a quick win to a website builder &#8212; but not if the entity responsible for safeguarding visitors&#8217; information fails to properly assess EU-based legal risk.</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; reprimand for the parliament thus has wider significant as it looks likely to prefigure a wave of aligned decisions by EU regulators, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/">scores of similar complaints filed by noyb in August 2020 targeting websites across the bloc</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect more rulings on this matter in the next month,&#8221; noyb&#8217;s honorary chairman, Max Schrems, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The fact that the EDPS has taken a clear position is a good sign for other DPAs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; sanction of the parliament over confusing cookie banners also sends a strong signal over what&#8217;s acceptable and what&#8217;s not when it comes to obtaining users&#8217; consent to tracking &#8212; despite confusing dark patterns still being shamefully widespread in the EU.</p>
<p>(For a particularly ironic example of that, see this <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/from-compliance-to-privacy-ux-regulators-come-for-dark-patterns/">blog post by analyst Forrester</a> &#8212; which warns that regulators are coming for &#8220;dark patterns&#8221;, even as the analyst&#8217;s own webpage serves what very much looks like a non-compliant cookie notice given the only obvious button reads &#8220;Accept cookies&#8221; and it takes multiple clicks through sub-menus to find an option to reject tracking cookies, so er&#8230; )</p>
<p>noyb also kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">a major effort targeting this type of cookie non-compliance last year</a> &#8212; which it suggested could lead to it filing up to 10,000 complaints about dubious cookie banners with EU regulators.</p>
<p>Regional regulators are clearly going to have their work cut out to clean up so much infringement &#8212; which in turn may encourage DPAs to coordinate on standardizing enforcements to drive the necessary scale of change.</p>
<p>The EDPS decision adds high level accelerant by sending a clear signal that confusing cookie banners are the same as non-compliant cookie banners from the body responsible for providing EU lawmakers with expert guidance on how to interpret and apply data protection law.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an illustrative snippet from its decision &#8212; which describes a portion of the confusion that hit visitors to the parliament website as they tried to parse the cookie notices at the time of the complaints (tracking cookies have since been removed from the site):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The English version only referred to essential cookies and prompted the user to either click on the ‘accept all’ or the ‘save’ button. The difference between the two buttons was unclear. The French version of the second layer of cookie banner referred both to essential cookies and ‘external media’. These external media cookies included cookies from Facebook, Google Maps, Instagram, OpenStreetMap, Twitter, Vimeo and Youtube. The visitor could also choose between ‘accept all’ or ‘save’. The German version of the second layer of the cookie banner referred to only one ‘external media’ cookie &#8212; Google Maps &#8212; in addition to the essential cookie.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; conclusion was that the cookie banners in all three languages failed to meet the EU standard for consent.</p>
<p>In another sign of the cookie (non)compliance reckoning that&#8217;s now unfolding in the region, some EU regulators have been taking actual action &#8212; such as France&#8217;s CNIL which issued a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/cnil-facebook-google-cookie-consent-eprivacy-breaches/">major slap-down to Google and Facebook last week</a>, announcing fines of $170M and $68M respectively for choosing dark pattern design over clear choices in their cookie consent flows.</p>
<p>The EDPB, which supports DPAs&#8217; enforcement of pan-EU rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, established a task force on the cookie issue <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-establishes-cookie-banner-taskforce_en">last fall</a> &#8212; saying it would &#8220;coordinate the response to complaints concerning cookie banners&#8221; noyb had filed with a number of regional agencies.</p>
<p>Schrems describes that step as a &#8220;good&#8221; development &#8212; but said it is also slowing things down.</p>
<p>Although he suggested the direction of travel is toward a standard that will require a simple yes/no for tracking. (Which will of course mean a firm &#8220;no&#8221; in the vast majority of cases, given how few people like being stalked by ads &#8212; hence the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">UK DPA&#8217;s recent warning to adtech that the end of tracking is nigh</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The CNIL and the EDPS decisions support the view by us that we need to move to fair &#8216;yes or no&#8217; options,&#8221; Schrems told us. &#8220;We expect other authorities to follow this lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about his vintage data flows complaint via-a-vis Facebook&#8217;s EU-US transfers? Is there any sign of Ireland&#8217;s promised &#8220;swift&#8221; resolution to that particular complaint &#8212; which should have led to a DPA order to Facebook to suspend data flows years ago? But has so far only led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order in September 2020</a> that Facebook suspend transfers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always say that each decision is coming any day &#8212; I stopped following these rumors but there is a rumor on this again right now&#8230; &#8221; Schrems said on the DPC, concluding his text with an eyeroll emoji.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vodafone Idea said on Tuesday it is giving the Indian government a 35.8% stake in the company after its board approved conversion of dues and spectrum auction instalments into equity to save the third-largest telecom operator in the country from collapsing.</p>
<p>The operator, a joint venture between the British telecoms group Vodafone and local billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s conglomerate, has been attempting to avoid a collapse for several years after the arrival of Reliance Jio, which undercut the competitors with cheap data and free calls offering.</p>
<p>Vodafone Idea, additionally, owed New Delhi dues of roughly $6.76 billion. Following the conversion into equity, Vodafone Group’s shareholding will be diluted to 28.5% while Aditya Birla Group&#8217;s will shrink to 17.8%. The Indian government will become the largest shareholder in the wireless telecom operator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shares of Vodafone Idea dropped over 19% on the news and was trading at ₹11.9 (16 cents) apiece at 2.30 am local time.</p>
<p>Bharti Airtel, the second largest telecom operator which also owes dues to the government, said last week it won’t be converting the interest on deferred spectrum related payments and government dues into equity. Its shares have largely remained flat today.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes months after the Indian government gave operators more time to pay dues on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/vodafone-idea-shares-tumble-23-after-india-orders-it-to-pay-billions-in-dues/">a two-decade dispute</a> last year. The Indian government and telecom operators have for a decade disputed how gross revenue should be calculated. The government has mandated the license and spectrum fee to be paid by operators as a share of their revenue. Telcos had argued that only core income accrued from use of spectrum should be considered for calculation of adjusted gross revenue.</p>
<p>The rescue plan, nonetheless, was critical to both the telecom operators who have been hurt by the arrival of Jio, run by Asia&#8217;s richest man Mukesh Ambani, which has become the top Indian telecom operator with over 400 million subscribers in just five years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many private phone operators have exited the market, merged with rivals, or filed for bankruptcy in recent years as Jio lured away subscribers. Vodafone Idea hasn&#8217;t reported annual profits since 2017.</p>
<p>Airtel and Vodafone Idea had sought relief on the $14 billion they owe to the government, a plea the Indian Supreme Court rejected last year. Vodafone Idea executives said in September last year that the company was hopeful of successfully raising funds to pay the dues.</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting that Vodafone Idea won’t have to resort to diluting its dues into equity. “With the recent ~20% tariff hikes and Vi having likely tied up the funding for repaying the non-convertible debentures maturing between December 2021 and February 2022, its prospects have improved. In our view, Vi is likely to continue its fund-raising efforts from its promoters and other investors rather than letting the government acquire a significant stake,” brokerage firm IIFL said Monday.</p>
