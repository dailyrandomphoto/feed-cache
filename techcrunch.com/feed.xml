										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games is teasing the biggest in-game event since Travis Scott psychedelically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/fortnite-hosted-a-psychedelic-travis-scott-concert-and-12-3m-people-watched/">stomped through Fortnite&#8217;s virtual meadows</a>.</p>
<p>The mysterious new event, which Fortnite-maker Epic is calling the &#8220;Rift Tour,&#8221; will kick off on Friday, August 6 and run through Sunday, August 8. In the teaser announcement, Epic invites players to &#8220;take a musical journey into magical new realities where Fortnite and a record-breaking superstar collide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1420752938327187462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In-game events building up to the mystery show series will run from July 29 through August 8, so players can hop into Fortnite to check out new Rift Tour-themed quests and rewards now. The cotton candy-colored event will offer a custom loading screen and a fluffy cloud kitty emoticon, among other digital prizes.</p>
<p>The Rift Tour isn&#8217;t a one-and-done event. Like the Travis Scott event, Fortnite will host five different show times across three days to make it easier for players to catch. Epic says they&#8217;ll have more details to share on Monday, August 2, so Fortnite players will have to wait for more hints or an official announcement about who&#8217;s performing.</p>
<p>So&#8230; who&#8217;s performing? So far, all signs point to Ariana Grande. Leakers have been saying as much for more than a week, and the documents revealed through Epic&#8217;s court battle with Apple also detailed plans for in-game events with both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-04-fortnite-planned-metroid-crossover-ariana-and-lady-gaga-concerts">Grande and Lady Gaga</a>.</p>

<p>At Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/07/28/fortnite-posters-hint-an-ariana-grande-concert-is-coming/?sh=b0c5c9310d58">Paul Tassi also connected the dots</a> on how recent leaks point to Grande, including some visual themes from her music videos and a reference to her pet pig, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realpiggysmallz/?hl=en">Piggy Smalls</a>.</p>
<p>Since Epic is calling its latest virtual event a tour, that suggests Grande won&#8217;t be alone, if she is indeed the mystery superstar. A Lady Gaga appearance could also be in the cards, since Epic apparently had plans for Gaga to appear in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert">December 2020 concert</a> that never materialized. Kanye West is also releasing his <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/07/kanye-west-donda-living-in-atlanta-stadium">newest album on August 6</a>, but it seems less likely that Epic would be willing to partner with West given his myriad recent controversies. And &#8220;Donda,&#8221; West&#8217;s latest album, was originally scheduled for a different date before being delayed.</p>
<p>Whoever it winds up being, we&#8217;ll likely know more on Monday. Even if you&#8217;re not a Grande fan or a regular gamer, Fortnite&#8217;s in-game concerts are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBsCzN-jfvA">some of the most creative</a> and visually exciting virtual events to date.</p>
<p>Everyone should fall through the metaverse with their friends while a skyscraper-sized virtual rapper shoots neon lightning bolts at least once.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The union of talent and money is what startup markets need to thrive. But there are other reasons why LatAm startups are often in the news: strong digital penetration and quick e-commerce growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today we’re wrapping our multi-week exploration of the global venture capital market’s second-quarter performance. We’ve gone around the world, working to better understand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">the geyser of cash flowing into today’s startups</a>. But we’ve saved the best for last: Latin America.</p>
<p>At a glance, the Latin American venture capital and startup market appears similar to what we’ve seen from other growing ecosystems. Like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">U.S.,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/canadas-startup-market-booms-alongside-hot-global-vc-investment/">Canadian,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">European,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">Indian</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/"> African</a> startup hubs, Latin America is seeing venture capital activity set records.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But inside the big numbers is a surprising picture of a startup market in the process of maturing while outside money hunts for breakout opportunities.</p>
<p>To help us in our exploration of Latin America’s epic second quarter, we collected notes and observations from NXTP’s Gonzalo Costa, Magma Partners’ Nathan Lustig and ALLVP’s Federico Antoni. We also have data from Dealroom, CB Insights, the Global Private Capital Association (GPCA) and ALLVP.</p>
<p>Today we’re digging into the data, yes, but also the human potential behind the startup rush. According to Antoni, the Latin American startup market of today “is a story about talent, not about capital.” Echoing the point in a <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f">recent piece</a> about &#8220;the Latin American startup opportunity,&#8221; U.S. venture capital firm Sequoia wrote that it has “been blown away by the quality of founders in the current wave.” So we’ll have to do more than just read charts.</p>
<p>The union of talent and money is what startup markets need to thrive. But there are other reasons why Latin American startups are so frequently in the news today, including structural factors, such as <a href="https://docsend.com/view/49zkutri8yxtbgmu">strong digital penetration</a> and <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-ecommerce-2020">quick e-commerce growth</a>.</p>

NXTP’s Costa made a bullish argument: The portion of “market capitalization from technology companies in Latin America is only 2.5% today compared to 40%+ in the U.S,” and his firm expects the two numbers to “converge in the long-term.” Our read of that set of data points is that there are a host of future Latin American public tech companies being founded &#8212; and funded &#8212; today.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about Latin American venture capital data, dig into which countries are rising stars in the region, learn how quickly Latin American startups have to go cross-border, and explore how quickly capital is recycling in the ecosystem – always a key test for startup-market longevity.</p>
<h2>A venture capital wave</h2>
<p>Latin America is on pace for all-time records in venture capital dollars raised and venture capital rounds in 2021. According <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">to CB Insights data</a>, startups in the region have already raised $9.3 billion in 2021’s first six months from 414 deals. The same data set indicates that in all of 2020, startups in the region raised $5.3 billion across 526 deals. And in case you’re worried that we’re comparing to an unfairly COVID-impacted year, in 2019 the numbers were $5.3 billion (again) from 614 individual deals.</p>
<p>This year is different, and the second quarter of 2021 was simply an outlier event. With some $7.2 billion invested in Latin American startups, Q2 2021’s closest rival in terms of quarterly venture totals was the second quarter of 2017, when $2.6 billion was invested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockchain infrastructure startups are heating up as industry fervor brings more developers and users to a space that still feels extremely young despite a heavy institutional embrace of the crypto space in 2021.</p>
<p>The latest crypto startup to court the attention of venture capitalists is <a href="https://tenderly.co/">Tenderly</a>, which builds a developer platform for Ethereum devs to monitor and test the smart contracts that power their decentralized apps. Tenderly CEO Andrej Bencic tells TechCrunch his startup has closed a $15.3 million Series A funding round led by Accel with additional participation from existing investors. The Belgrade startup already raised a $3.3 million seed round earlier this year led by Point Nine Capital.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s aim to date has been ensuring fledgling blockchain developers aren&#8217;t left finding out about contract errors when users discover issues and complain, instead allowing users to discover these bugs proactively. While the company&#8217;s Visual Debugger is already used by &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of Ethereum developers, Tenderly hopes to continue building out its toolset to help more developers build on Ethereum networks without dealing with the headaches and irregularities that they&#8217;ve had to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Tenderly, from its inception, has been a solution to one of our own problems,&#8221; Bencic tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We wanted to make it as easy as possible to observe and extract information from Ethereum and the adjacent networks<span class="Apple-converted-space">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Bencic hopes the company&#8217;s product can help developers get their products out more quickly without compromising on usability.</p>
<p>To date, the majority of Tenderly&#8217;s customers have been relatively small startup efforts aiming to tap into the exciting world of blockchain-based computing with a particular focus on decentralized finance. Tenderly itself is a small company with its team of 14 based in Serbia. Bencic says this funding will help the company expand its global footprint and build out engineering and business hires in other geographies.</p>
<p>Climbing cryptocurrency prices have historically aligned pretty closely with developer uptake in the blockchain world so there is some concern that bitcoin and Ethereum&#8217;s downward-trending price corrections will lead to less stability in the pipeline of new developers embracing blockchain. That said, volatility is far from unusual to the crypto world and many developers have learned that riding its ebbs and flows is just part of the experience.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We built most of Tenderly in the bear market, and one thing we saw is that even though you get these concerning prices, people that are excited about the tech are excited about the tech whether the coins are up or down,&#8221; Bencic says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Merqueo offers more than 8,000 products, including fresh foods, packaged goods, home essentials, beverages and frozen products. It currently operates in more than 25 cities and has over 600,000 users.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://merqueo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merqueo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which operates a full-stack, on-demand delivery service in Latin America, has landed $50 million in a Series C round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDC Ventures, Digital Bridge and IDB Invest co-led the round, which also included participation from MGM Innova Group, Celtic House Venture Partners, Palm Drive Capital and previous shareholders. The financing brings the Bogota, Colombia-based startup’s total raised to $85 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merqueo CEO and co-founder Miguel McAllister knows a thing or two about the delivery space in Latin America, having also co-founded Domicilios.com, a Latin American food delivery company that was bought by Berlin-based Delivery Hero and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/ifood-merges-with-delivery-heros-domicilios-com-to-challenge-rappi-in-colombia/">merged with Brazil&#8217;s iFood</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAllister describes Merqueo as a “pure-play online supermarket with a fully integrated grocery delivery service” that sources directly from large brands and local suppliers, bypassing intermediaries and “delivering directly from its dark store network.” (Dark stores are traditional retail stores that have been converted to local fulfillment centers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merqueo offers more than 8,000 products, including fresh foods, packaged goods, home essentials, beverages and frozen products. It currently operates in more than 25 cities in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil and has over 600,000 users.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183699" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183699" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183699 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merqueo-App-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merqueo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be doing something right. The startup is close to $100 million in “run-rate revenue,” according to McAllister, having grown more than 2.5x in 2020. Merqueo also reached positive cash flow in Colombia, its most mature market. Over the last year, large Latin American retail chains and retailers have approached the company about potentially acquiring it, McAllister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the company’s success might be attributed to the speed and flexibility it offers. Users can choose how and when to receive their groceries according to their needs, with the startup offering delivery in as little as 10 minutes or three to four hours. Users can also schedule delivery of their groceries in two-hour intervals for the same day or the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, owning and controlling the &#8220;entire&#8221; vertical supply chain gives it the ability to obtain better margins, offer competitive pricing and achieve healthy unit economics, according to McAllister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merqueo plans to use its new capital in part to expand geographically. The company is currently in phase one of its expansion to Brazil, entering initially in Sao Paulo later this month. Next year, it expects to launch in other Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza and Salvador de Bahia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market opportunity in Latin America is massive considering that online grocery sales only represent just 1% of the market –– far lower than in the U.S., EU or China, for example. Other players in the increasingly crowded space include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/filing-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-is-raising-750m-more-at-a-13-5b-valuation/">GoPuff</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/">Getir</a> out of Turkey and Mexico-based Jüsto, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">raised $65 million in a Series A</a> led by General Atlantic earlier this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online grocery shopping in LatAm,” McAllister told TechCrunch. “The region went from 0.3% share of online groceries to 1%. And after the pandemic, we are seeing a 50% increase in the pace of user adoption.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly, with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Merqueo has over 1,300 employees in LatAm, up 60% from last year. It plans to continue hiring with the proceeds from the Series C round as well work “to become the largest and most ambitious dark stores network of Latin America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandro Rodríguez, managing partner at IDC Ventures, is naturally bullish on Merqueo’s potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From all the opportunities we looked into, Merqueo is undoubtedly the most advanced in the region. &#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Merqueo team has proved they know how to scale the business and how to get to profitability,&#8221; Rodríguez told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online grocery delivery is a business with many technical and operational complexities, he said. In his view, Merqueo’s technology and operational expertise allow it to tackle those issues in a way that has led to “the best customer experience that we have seen in a scalable way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have the best combination of both great service metrics and healthy unit economics,” Rodríguez added.</span></p>

They&#8217;ll even get material tailored to common ridesharing scenarios.</p>
<p>Drivers will need to have reached Gold, Platinum or Diamond status through the Uber Pro program in a qualifying country (including large parts of the Americas, the UK, India and Spain).</p>
<p>The courses arrive alongside another career initiative. Drivers in some countries (including many of those from the Rosetta program) can request an achievements letter that will help them with job applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber wasn&#8217;t shy about the official rationale for both moves. Many of its drivers are either immigrants (and less likely to be familiar with local languages) or see languages and rideshare work as key to expanding their opportunities. Uber is aware that driving for the company might just be a &#8220;temporary stop&#8221; on a career path — this gives workers a better chance to move upward.</p>
<p>There are practical incentives for Uber. The more languages its drivers speak, the more likely those drivers are to get favorable ratings and encourage repeat business. The career incentives could also encourage more drivers to sign up for Uber in the first place, even if they ultimately spend less time in the role.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">DevOps is fundamentally about collaboration and agility. Unfortunately, when we add security and compliance to the picture, the message gets distorted.</p>
<p>The term “DevSecOps” has come into fashion the past few years with the intention of seamlessly integrating security and compliance into the DevOps framework. However, the reality is far from the ideal: Security tools have been bolted onto the existing DevOps process along with new layers of automation, and everyone&#8217;s calling it &#8220;DevSecOps.&#8221; This is a misguided approach that fails to embrace the principles of collaboration and agility.</p>
<blockquote><p>Integrating security into DevOps to deliver DevSecOps demands changed mindsets, processes and technologies. Security and risk management leaders must adhere to the collaborative, agile nature of DevOps for security testing to be seamless in development, making the “Sec” in DevSecOps transparent. — <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3978490/12-things-to-get-right-for-successful-devsecops">Neil MacDonald, Gartner</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In an ideal world, all developers would be trained and experienced in secure coding practices from front end to back end and be skilled in preventing everything from SQL injection to authorization framework exploits. Developers would also have all the information they need to make security-related decisions early in the design phase.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If a developer is working on a type of security control they haven’t worked on before, an organization should provide the appropriate training before there is a security issue.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Once again, the reality falls short of the ideal. While CI/CD automation has given developers ownership over the deployment of their code, those developers are still hampered by a lack of visibility into relevant information that would help them make better decisions before even sitting down to write code.</p>
<p>The entire concept of discovering and remediating vulnerabilities earlier in the development process is already, in some ways, out of date. A better approach is to provide developers with the information and training they need to prevent potential risks from becoming vulnerabilities in the first place.</p>
<p>Consider a developer that is assigned to add PII fields to an internet-facing API. The authorization controls in the cloud API gateway are critical to the security of the new feature. &#8220;Shifting left and extending right” doesn’t mean that a scanning tool or security architect should detect a security risk earlier in the process — it means that a developer should have all the context to prevent the vulnerability before it even happens. Continuous feedback is key to up-leveling the security knowledge of developers by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant listed the particular devices that will be affected by the switch in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G7H6AASHTERXBKNV&amp;ref_=pe_45724480_593852510&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22362788[t]w[r]trello.com[d]D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">its FAQ page</a>. It noted that the first- and second-generation Kindles, as well as the Kindle DX, won&#8217;t be able to connect to the internet at all since they don&#8217;t have WiFi connectivity to fall back on. The other devices in the list are the Kindle Keyboard (3rd Generation), Kindle Touch (4th Generation), Kindle Paperwhite (5th, 6th and 7th Generation), Kindle Voyage (7th Generation) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-02-amazon-kindle-oasis-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Kindle Oasis</a> (8th Generation), all of which have WiFi connection.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll still be able to access your books on an older device and can do wired transfers if you want, though. And if you have a newer 4G or WiFi-only Kindle, you won&#8217;t be affected at all. In its email, Amazon included a code customers can use to get $50 off a new Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis, along with $15 in eBook credits. You may want to check your inbox to see if you got the company&#8217;s notice in case you&#8217;ve been looking to upgrade anyway.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Amazon launched support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/amazons-fire-tv-cube-adds-support-for-two-way-video-calls-via-a-connected-tv/">two-way calling</a> that worked with its Fire TV Cube devices. The feature allowed consumers to make and receive calls from their connected TV to any other Alexa device with a screen. Today, the company is <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/two-way-video-calling-with-zoom-now-available-on-fire-tv-cube-2nd-gen-7ba70699386a">expanding</a> this system to enable support for two-way calling with Zoom.</p>
<p>Starting today, Fire TV Cube owners (2nd gen) will be able to join Zoom work meetings or virtual hangouts via their Fire TV Cube.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the new feature, you&#8217;ll need Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV Cube, its hands-free streaming device and smart speaker that has Alexa built-in, as well as a webcam that supports USB Video Class (UVC) with at least 720p resolution and 30fps. But for a better experience, Amazon recommends a webcam with 1080p resolution and a 60-90 degree field of view from six to 10 feet away from the TV. It doesn&#8217;t recommend 4K webcams, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon suggests webcams like the Logitech C920, C922x, C310 or the Wansview 101JD, for example.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll then connect your webcam to your Fire TV Cube using a Micro USB to USB adapter.</p>
<p>For best results, you&#8217;ll want to attach the webcam above the TV screen, Amazon notes.</p>
<p>Once everything is set up and connected, you&#8217;ll need to download and install the Zoom app from the Fire TV Appstore. When joining meetings, you can either sign in as a guest or use an existing Zoom account, per the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Alexa integration, you can join your meetings hands-free, if you prefer, by way of a voice command like &#8220;Alexa, join my Zoom meeting.&#8221; Alexa will respond by prompting you for the meeting ID and passcode. Alternately, you can choose to use the remote control to enter in this information.</p>
<p>An optional feature also lets you sync your calendar to Alexa to allow the smart assistant to remind you about the upcoming meetings it finds on your calendar. If you go this route, Alexa will suggest the meeting to join and you&#8217;ll just have to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to be automatically dialed in.</p>
<p>Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite/">announced</a> it was bringing video calling support to its Fire TV platform last fall &#8212; a significant update in the new era of remote work and schooling, driven by the pandemic. However, it&#8217;s not the only option on the market. Google also last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/google-finally-brings-group-calling-to-the-nest-hub-max/">brought group video calls</a> to its Hub Max devices, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/googles-nest-hub-max-smart-screen-can-now-make-zoom-calls/">later added support for Zoom calls</a>. Meanwhile Facebook Portal devices have offered<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/facebooks-video-calling-portal-devices-add-whatsapp-login-new-features-and-content/"> video calling</a> of a more personal nature and last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebooks-smart-display-portal-adds-support-for-netflix-zoom-and-other-features/">updated to support Zoom, too.</a></p>
<p>In other words, Amazon is playing a bit of catch-up here. And its solution is a little more unwieldy as it requires consumers to buy their own webcam, while something like Portal TV offers a TV with a smart camera included.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, you&#8217;ll need the latest Fire TV Cube software <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GTW7A7AUYMKWNVYA">update</a> to get started, Amazon notes.</p>

<p>“My top three benefits of going to Disrupt were introducing my product to people who would not have seen it otherwise; networking with investors, mentors, advisers and potential customers and, finally, talking to other entrepreneurs and founders and learning what it took to get their companies off the ground.” — Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of CPRWrap.</p>
<p>“Disrupt gave our company and technology invaluable exposure to potential customers and partners that we would not have met otherwise. A company that does 15 billion in annual sales thinks our tech is a fit for their ecosystem, and we’re excited to continue building that relationship.” — Joel Neidig, founder of SIMBA Chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lahaus.com/">La Haus</a>, which has developed an online real estate marketplace operating in Mexico and Colombia, has secured $100 million in additional funding, including $50 million in equity and $50 million in debt financing.</p>
<p>The new capital was obtained as an extension to the company’s Series B, the first tranche of which closed in January. With the latest infusion, Medellin, Colombia-based La Haus has now secured $135 million total for the round and over $158 million in funding since its 2017 inception.</p>
<p>San Francisco Bay Area venture firms Acrew Capital and Renegade Partners co-led the round, which also included participation from Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, Endeavor Catalyst, Moore Strategic Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Rappi’s Simon Borrero, Maluma, and Gabriel Gilinski. Existing backers who put money in this round include Greenspring Associates, Kaszek, NFX, Spencer Rascoff’s 75 &amp; Sunny Ventures, Hadi Partovi and NuBank’s David Velez.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jerónimo Uribe (CEO), Rodrigo Sánchez-Ríos (president), Tomás Uribe (chief growth officer) and Santiago Garcia (CTO) founded the company after Jerónimo and Tomas met Sánchez-Ríos at Stanford University. Prior to La Haus they started and ran Jaguar Capital, a Colombian real estate development company with over $350 million of completed retail and residential projects.</p>
<p>The company declined to reveal at what valuation the extension was raised, with Sánchez-Ríos saying only that it was “a significant increase” from January.</p>
<p>The Series B extension follows impressive growth for the startup, which saw the number of transactions conducted on its Mexico portal climb by nearly 10x in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the 2020 second quarter. With over 500 homes selling on its platform (via lahaus.com and lahaus.mx) the company is “the market leader in selling new housing in Spanish-speaking Latam by an order of magnitude,” its execs claim. La Haus expects to have facilitated more than $1 billion in annualized gross sales by the end of the year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Like the US, a two-tier venture capital market is emerging in Latin America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/embed/#?secret=6FPRPBvpGC" data-secret="6FPRPBvpGC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup was founded with the mission of making it easier for people to buy homes and helping “solve Latam’s extreme housing inequality.” Its end goal is to accelerate access to new housing by both generating and curating supply and demand and then matching it with its technology, noted Sánchez-Ríos.</p>
<p>“In the last six months, our chief product officer has built a product that allows this to happen 100% digitally,” he said. “Before it would take a lot of time, people involved and visits. We want to provide people looking for a home a similar experience as to people looking for their next flight at delta.com.”</p>
<p>It has done that by embedding its software to developers’ new projects so that it can bring that digital experience to its users.</p>
<p>“They are able to view the projects on our sites, we match them and then they can see in real time which units of a particular tower are available, and then select, sign and pay for everything digitally,” Sánchez-Río said.</p>

<p>The need for new housing in the region and other emerging markets in general is acute, they believe. And the pace of building new homes is slow because small and midsized developers — who are responsible for building the majority of new homes in Latin America — are cash constrained. At the same time, mortgages are mostly not affordable for consumers, with banks extending only a fraction of the credit to individuals compared to the U.S., and often at far worse terms.</p>
<p>What La Haus is planning to do with its new capital — particularly the debt portion — is go beyond selling homes via its marketplace to helping extend financing to both developers and potential buyers. It plans to take the proprietary data it has been able to glean from the thousands of real estate transactions conducted on its platform to extend capital to developers and consumers “more quickly, with much lower risk and at better terms.</p>
<p>”Already, what the startup has accomplished is notable. Being able to purchase a home 100% digitally is not that easy even in the U.S. Pulling that off in Latin America — which has historically trailed behind in digital adoption — is no easy feat. By year’s end, La Haus intends to be in every major metropolitan area in Mexico and Colombia.<br />
Its ultimate goal is to be able to help new, sustainable homes “to be built faster, alleviating the inequality caused by lack of access to inventory.”</p>
<p>To Acrew Capital’s Lauren Kolodny, La Haus is building a solution specific to the issues of Latin America’s housing market, rather than importing business models — such as iBuying — from the U.S.</p>
<p>“For many people in the United States home equity is their largest asset. In Latin America, however, consumers have been challenged with an impenetrable real estate market stacked against consumers,” she wrote via email. “La Haus is removing barriers to home ownership that stifles millions of people from achieving financial security. Specifically, Latin America has no centralized MLS, very costly interest rates, no transactional transparency, and few online informational tools.”</p>
<p>La Haus, Kolodny added, is breaking down these barriers by consolidating listings online, offering pricing transparency and educating consumers about their financing options.</p>
<p>Acrew first invested in the startup in its $10 million Series A and has been impressed with its growth over time.<br />
“They have a unique focus on new housing &#8212; a massive industry worldwide, but especially in emerging markets where new housing is so necessary,” Kolodny said. “The management team … knows real estate in Latin America better than anyone we&#8217;ve met.”</p>
<p>For its part, the La Haus team is excited to put its new capital to work. As Sánchez-Río put it, “$50 million goes a lot further in Mexico and Colombia than in the U.S.”</p>
<p>“We are going to be very aggressive in Mexico and Colombia, and plan to go from four to at least 12 markets by the end of the year,” Jeronimo told TechCrunch. “We’re also excited to roll out our financing solution to developers and buyers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html?src=rss" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">booming business</a> is dominated by digital ads, but it also has hardware ambitions beyond VR. During the company&#8217;s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said its next product release would be a pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things,&#8221; the Facebook co-founder said. &#8220;So I&#8217;m excited to get those into people&#8217;s hands and to continue to make progress on the journey toward full augmented reality glasses in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s sunglasses have been the subject of rumors since 2019. Back then, sources told <em>CNBC </em>that Facebook was working with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-orion-ar-glasses.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">AR eyewear nicknamed &#8220;Orion.&#8221;</a> The glasses were billed as a full-fledged phone replacement on which you could take calls, see information and even broadcast livestreams. That inevitably drew comparisons to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-google-glass-enterprise-edition-2.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Google Glass</a> (another Luxottica collab) instead of the phone-tethered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-13-snap-spectacles-3.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Spectacles</a> from Snap. Last year, Hugo Barra, then VP VR at Facebook Reality Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">confirmed</a> that the glasses would land in 2021. But, we haven&#8217;t heard much since.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Facebook, the glasses hold the key to its future. Alongside virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) is integral to building the &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. In the future, Facebook will morph into a shared, liveable platform that lets you &#8220;teleport&#8221; between different social experiences using VR and AR, Zuckerberg explained.</p>
<p>The term metaverse is the latest buzzword seized upon by Silicon Valley and futurists. While the concept has been around for well over a decade, it gained traction after the breakout success of multiplayer game creation platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-09-fornite-playground-cash-cow-minecraft.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-sony-in-game-music-153541190.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Roblox</em></a>. Earlier this week, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella mentioned an &#8220;enterprise metaverse&#8221; on his company&#8217;s earnings call.</p>
<p>For Facebook, the metaverse is more than just a fad. The company is spending billions in order to build its shared universe, which will be populated with Facebook users and digital ads, according to Zuckerberg. In order for it to become a reality, the company needs more people to buy its computing hardware. Therefore, the plan is to make those devices more affordable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business model isn&#8217;t going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible,&#8221; Zuckerberg noted. &#8220;So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. So that&#8217;s kind of at a high level how I&#8217;m thinking about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunglasses aren&#8217;t the only hardware Facebook is reportedly working on. Multiple reports have claimed Facebook is developing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-watch-rumor-222419888.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">smartwatch</a> with a built-in cellular connection and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">detachable display</a>. Initially, it was believed that the watch would be first out the gate, but it seems Zuckerberg had other plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industrial robotics are big and heavy — and in some cases, legitimately dangerous. They’re also extremely difficult to train — particularly if you plan to implement them for tasks outside of their purpose-built intentions.</p>
<p>There’s huge opportunity for the right AI/software company to come along and help make the bulky systems intended for things like auto manufacturing easier to program and more versatile. Honestly, there’s probably enough room to support multiple companies in the category as robots become an increasingly essential part of how we do business.</p>
<p>This week we saw a pair of big news stories from companies operating in that space. On Tuesday, Covariant announced an $80 million raise — a quick follow-up to the $40 million Series B it announced in May 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2183276" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183276" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2183276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg 6430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183276" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Covariant</p></div></p>
<p>I spoke to president, chief scientist and co-founder (and recurring TC Sessions: Robotics guest) Pieter Abbeel for the piece, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/robotic-ai-firm-covariant-raises-another-80-million/">you can check out here</a>. I further picked the long-time UC Berkeley professor’s brain about some broader robotics trends.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve seen a marked increase in investment activity around robotics and automation since the beginning of the pandemic. Do you anticipate that this interest will maintain?</strong></p>
<p>It won’t just maintain. It’ll continue to accelerate on a dramatic scale. The demand isn’t new but the pandemic has certainly increased demand for resilient and robust robotics. COVID-19 accelerated a timeline that was already in motion. Other factors that contribute to the momentum include the rise of e-commerce replacing in-store purchases along with Amazon’s strive for efficiency. They’ve raised consumer expectations of fast delivery across the board and making good on that promise often starts with warehouse automation.</p>
<p><strong>As someone with experience in both an educational setting and a startup, how have universities’ approach to incubating companies evolved. What more can and should be done to foster entrepreneurship?</strong></p>
<p>With AI the transition from research to practice has been exceptionally fast. An idea could be published today, and many companies might be implementing it into their systems the next day. This trend has made AI researchers uniquely positioned to build new applications (compare this to, let&#8217;s say, Airbnb, Uber, food delivery companies, etc., which were not enabled by research advances, but by everyone having a smartphone, enabling a new model of doing business).</p>
<p>Structurally, one clear change at many universities is the introduction of artificial intelligence across many programs. A great example is &#8220;The Business of AI&#8221; course, which I co-teach in the Haas Business School at Berkeley, and which gives business students a solid understanding of the role of AI today, as well as trends and what the future might bring.</p>
<p>To foster more entrepreneurship in the U.S., leadership should consider how many international students are also the leading AI researchers. A faster visa/green card process for entrepreneurs would have a very high impact.</p>
<p><strong>Do you foresee continuing to teach, as Covariant grown?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I see a very strong synergy between being at the forefront of academic AI research at Berkeley and being at the forefront of industrial R&amp;D bringing AI Robotics into the real world as chief scientist at Covariant. The culture our CEO Peter Chen has fostered at Covariant also has great alignment with this; curiosity and lifelong learning are core values at Covariant.</p>
<p><strong>How actively does your team consider biases in its AI work?</strong></p>
<p>Bias in AI systems is of course a broader industry issue and is on the minds of our team members. As of today, bias in AI systems doesn&#8217;t directly play a role in our current robotic warehousing efforts. However, quality assurance more generally is core to everything we do, and quality assurance isn’t a one-axis thing, we have to consider quality and coverage of various data sources and performance across SKUs, warehouses, customers, etc. In that sense, there are actually many technical parallels.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like most of the activity on the industrial robotics front is happening on the software/AI side. Are robotics manufacturers continuing to evolve their hardware as software improves?</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, while we largely focus on the software/AI ourselves, we work with amazing partners to deliver fully functioning robotic systems. In doing so, we see continual improvement on the hardware as well. Most visible over a short time period are continual changes in end-of-arm tooling. In addition, we see interesting multiyear roadmap ideas in robotic arm form factors that take more R&amp;D and design effort to bring to market.</p>

<p>The other big news of the week is the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/"> unveiling of Intrinsic</a>, Alphabet’s most recent robotics play. Or, I guess I should say, most recently announced robotics play. The Alphabet X spinout has apparently been in the works for about five years now. It follows a fairly uneven robotics track record for Alphabet/Google that involved brief ownership of Boston Dynamics. But the company’s offering seems much more in-line with what Google excels at.</p>
<p>Here’s Intrinsic CEO, Wendy Tan-White, who most recently served as Alphabet’s VP of Moonshots:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation and force control.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2182842" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182842" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OSU-Bipedal-Robot-First-to-Run-5K.2021-07-27-17_42_07.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility</p></div></p>
<p>Closing the week’s roundup with a pair of athletic ‘bots. First is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/cassie-the-bipedal-robot-runs-a-5k/">the return of Cassie</a>, Oregon State University’s bipedal robot. Cassie took a bit of a backseat to OSU spinoff Agility’s delivery robot, Digit, but the school is continuing to do interesting things with the platform. A team of research helped teach the robot to run, using a a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>
<p>In fact, Cassie managed to run a 5K in 53 minutes. Not great by human standards, but extremely solid for a robot using a single battery, particularly when you factor in the 6.5 minutes of troubleshooting an overheated computer and a poorly maneuvered turn.</p>
<p>Outside Olympians and T-shirt vendors, Toyota may well have been the most disappointed about the initial decision to delay the summer Olympics. The automotive giant clearly envisioned the Tokyo games as an ideal opportunity to showcase its technology for the world.</p>
<p>Now that the games are on, the company’s basketball robot <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/27/tokyo-olympics-robot/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">CUE is back in a big way</a>. After debuting in 2018, CUE returned to sink three-pointers during half-time at the USA-France game.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aircraft — which is still in small-scale prototype form — uses a new VTOL technique that redirects the flow of air from its engines using flaps.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Air taxis may still be pie in the sky, but there&#8217;s more than one way to move the air travel industry forward. <a href="https://www.craft.aero/">Craft Aerospace</a> aims to do so with a totally new vertical takeoff and landing aircraft that it believes could make city-to-city hops simpler, faster, cheaper and greener.</p>
<p>The aircraft — which, to be clear, is still in small-scale prototype form — uses a new VTOL technique that redirects the flow of air from its engines using flaps rather than turning them (like the well-known, infamously unstable Osprey), making for a much more robust and controllable experience.</p>
<p>Co-founder James Dorris believes that this fast, stable VTOL craft is the key that unlocks a new kind of local air travel, eschewing major airports for minor ones or even heliports. Anyone that&#8217;s ever had to take a flight that lasts under an hour knows that three times longer is spent in security lines, gate walks and, of course, getting to and from these necessarily distant major airports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about flying wealthy people to the mall — there are major inefficiencies in major corridors,&#8221; Dorris told TechCrunch. &#8220;The key to shortening that delay is picking people up in cities and dropping them off in cities. So for these short hops, we need to combine the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft and VTOL.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technique they arrived at is what&#8217;s called a &#8220;blown wing&#8221; or &#8220;deflected slipstream.&#8221; It looks a bit like something you&#8217;d see on the cover of a vintage science fiction rag, but the unusual geometry and numerous rotors serve a purpose.</p>
<p>The basic principle of a blown wing has been explored before now but never done on a production aircraft. You simply place a set of (obviously extremely robust) flaps directly behind the thrust, where they can be tilted down and into the exhaust stream, directing the airflow downward. This causes the craft to rise upward and forward, and as it gets enough altitude it can retract the flaps, letting the engines operate normally and driving the craft forward to produce ordinary lift.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183594" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183594" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183594 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?w=568" alt="" width="568" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png 1481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=251,300 251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=768,919 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=568,680 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=1283,1536 1283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2183594" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Craf Aerospace. During takeoff, thrust is redirected downward by extending flaps.</p></div></p>
<p>The many rotors are there for redundancy and so that the thrust can be minutely adjusted on each of the four &#8220;half-wings.&#8221; The shape, called a box wing, is also something that has been tried in a limited fashion (there are drones with it, for example) but ultimately never proved a valid alternative to a traditional swept wing. But Dorris and Craft believe it has powerful advantages, in this case, allowing for a much more stable, adjustable takeoff and landing than the two-engine Osprey. (Or, indeed, many proposed or prototype tilt-rotor aircraft out there.)</p>

During flight, the flaps retract and thrust pushes the plane forward as normal.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our tech is a combination of both existing and novel tech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The box wing has been built and flown; the high flap aircraft has been built and flown. They&#8217;ve never been synthesized like this in a VTOL aircraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>To reiterate: The company has demonstrated a limited scale model that shows the principle is sound — they&#8217;re not claiming there&#8217;s a full-scale craft ready to go. That&#8217;s years down the line, but willing partners will help them move forward.</p>
<p>The fifth-generation prototype (perhaps the size of a coffee table) hovers using the blown wing principle, and the sixth, due to fly in a few months, will introduce the transitioning flaps. (I was shown a video of the prototype doing tethered indoor hovering, but the company is not releasing this test footage publicly.)</p>
<p>The design of the final craft is still in flux — it&#8217;s not known exactly how many rotors it will have, for instance — but the basic size, shape and capabilities are already penned in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll carry nine passengers and a pilot, and fly around 35,000 feet or so at approximately 300 knots, or 345 mph. That&#8217;s slower than a normal passenger jet, but whatever time you lose in the air ought to be more than regained by skipping the airport. The range of the cleaner hybrid gas-electric engines should be around 1,000 miles, which gives a good amount of flexibility and safety margins. It also covers 45 of the top 50 busiest routes in the world, things like Los Angeles to San Francisco, Seoul to Jeju Island, and Tokyo to Osaka.</p>

It probably wouldn&#8217;t be flying at this altitude.</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, however, Dorris wants to make it clear that the idea is not &#8220;LAX to SFO&#8221; but &#8220;Hollywood to North Beach.&#8221; VTOL aircraft aren&#8217;t just for show: Regulations permitting, they can touch down in a much smaller location, though exactly what kind of landing pad and micro-airport is envisioned is, like the aircraft itself, still being worked out.</p>
<p>The team, which just worked its way through Y Combinator&#8217;s summer 2021 cohort, is experienced in building sophisticated transport: Dorris was a primary on Virgin Hyperloop&#8217;s propulsion system, and his co-founder Axel Radermacher helped build Karma Automotive&#8217;s drivetrain. It may not have escaped you that neither of those companies makes aircraft, but Dorris thinks of that as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen what&#8217;s come out of traditional aerospace over the last 10, 20 years,&#8221; he said, letting the obvious implication speak for itself that the likes of Boeing and Airbus aren&#8217;t exactly reinventing the wheel. And companies that partnered with automotive giants hit walls because there&#8217;s a mismatch between the scales — a few hundred aircraft is very different from half a million Chevy sedans.</p>

<p>So Craft is relying on partners who have looked to shake things up in aerospace. Among its advisers are Bryan Berthy (once director of engineering at Lockheed Martin), Nikhil Goel (one of Uber Elevate&#8217;s co-founders), and Brogan BamBrogan (early SpaceX employee and Hyperloop faithful).</p>
<p>The company also just announced a letter of intent from JSX, a small airline serving low-friction flights on local routes, to purchase 200 aircraft and the option for 400 more if wanted. Dorris believes that with their position and growth curve they could make a perfect early partner when the aircraft is ready, probably around 2025 with flights beginning in 2026.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a risky, weird play with a huge potential payoff, and Craft thinks that their approach, as unusual as it seems today, is just plainly a better way to fly a few hundred miles. Positive noises from the industry, and from investors, seem to back that feeling up. The company has received early-stage investment (of an unspecified total) from Giant Ventures, Countdown Capital, Soma Capital and its adviser Nikhil Goel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve demonstrated it, and we&#8217;re getting an enormous amount of traction from aerospace people who have seen hundreds of concepts,&#8221; said Dorris. &#8220;We&#8217;re a team of only seven, about to be nine, people. &#8230; Frankly, we&#8217;re extremely pleased with the level of interest we&#8217;re getting.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CEO Dan Schulman revealed the superapp would include high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds and messaging functionality outside of peer-to-peer payments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">plan to morph itself into a &#8220;superapp&#8221;</a> has been given a go for launch.</p>
<p>According to PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, speaking to investors during this week&#8217;s second-quarter earnings call, the initial version of PayPal&#8217;s new consumer digital wallet app is now &#8220;code complete&#8221; and the company is preparing to slowly ramp up. Over the next several months, PayPal expects to be fully ramped up in the U.S., with new payment services, financial services, commerce and shopping tools arriving every quarter.</p>
<p>The company has spoken for some time about its &#8220;superapp&#8221; ambitions &#8212; a shift in product direction that would make PayPal a U.S.-based version of something like China&#8217;s WeChat or Alipay or India&#8217;s Paytm. Like those apps, PayPal aims to offer a host of consumer services under one roof, beyond just mobile payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In previous quarters, PayPal said these new features may include things like enhanced direct deposit, check cashing, budgeting tools, bill pay, crypto support, subscription management, and buy now, pay later functionality. It also said it would integrate commerce, thanks to the mobile shopping tools acquired by way of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">$4 billion Honey acquisition</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>So far, PayPal has continued to run <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/explore">Honey</a> as a standalone application, website and browser extension, but the superapp could incorporate more of its deal-finding functions, price-tracking features and other benefits.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gWINTvdkO5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">PayPal details its digital wallet plans for 2021, including crypto, Honey integration and more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PayPal details its digital wallet plans for 2021, including crypto, Honey integration and more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/embed/#?secret=gWINTvdkO5" data-secret="gWINTvdkO5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, Schulman revealed the superapp would have a few other features as well, including high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds and messaging functionality outside of peer-to-peer payments &#8212; meaning you could chat with family and friends directly through the app&#8217;s user interface.</p>
<p>PayPal hadn&#8217;t announced its plans to include a messaging component until now, but the feature makes sense in terms of how people often combine chat and peer-to-peer payments today. For example, someone may want to make a personal request for the funds instead of just sending an automated request through an app. Or, after receiving payment, a user may want to respond with a &#8220;thank you,&#8221; or other acknowledgment. Currently, these conversations take place outside of the payment app itself on platforms like iMessage. Now, that could change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that&#8217;s going to drive a lot of engagement on the platform,&#8221; said Schulman. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to leave the platform to message back and forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the increased user engagement, the company expects to see a bump in average revenue per active account.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NPPHCN9Izt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/">Venmo to gain crypto, budgeting, savings and Honey integrations this year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venmo to gain crypto, budgeting, savings and Honey integrations this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/embed/#?secret=NPPHCN9Izt" data-secret="NPPHCN9Izt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Schulman also hinted at &#8220;additional crypto capabilities,&#8221; which were not detailed. However, PayPal earlier this month <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-07-15-Increased-Purchase-Limits-for-Crypto-on-PayPal">increased the crypto purchase limit</a> from $20,000 to $100,000 for eligible PayPal customers in the U.S., with no annual purchase limit. The company also this year made it possible for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">consumers to check out at millions of online businesses</a> using their cryptocurrencies, by first converting the crypto to cash then settling with the merchant in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Though the app&#8217;s code is now complete, Schulman said the plan is to continue to iterate on the product experience, noting that the initial version will not be &#8220;the be-all and end-all.&#8221; Instead, the app will see steady releases and new functionality on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>However, he did say that early on, the new features would include the high-yield savings, improved bill pay with a better user experience, and more billers and aggregators, as well as early access to direct deposit, budgeting tools and the new two-way messaging feature.</p>
<p>To integrate all the new features into the superapp, PayPal will undergo a major overhaul of its user interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, the [user experience] is being redesigned,&#8221; Schulman noted. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got rewards and shopping. We&#8217;ve got a whole giving hub around crowdsourcing, giving to charities. And then, obviously, buy now, pay later will be fully integrated into it. &#8230; The last time I counted, it was like 25 new capabilities that we&#8217;re going to put into the superapp.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital wallet app will also be personalized to the end user, so no two apps are the same. This will be done using both artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to &#8220;enhance each customer&#8217;s experiences and opportunities,&#8221; said Schulman.</p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/paypal-pypl-earnings-q2-2021.html">delivered</a> an earnings beat in the second quarter with $6.24 billion in revenue, versus the $6.27 billion Wall Street expected, and earnings per share of $1.15, versus the $1.12 expected. Total payment volume from merchant customers also jumped 40% to $311 billion, while analysts had projected $295.2 billion. But the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-paypal-earnings-q22021/">stock slipped</a> due to a lowered <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-stock-slips-as-earnings-beat-expectations-but-outlook-comes-up-short-11627504087">outlook for Q3</a>, impacted by eBay&#8217;s transition to its own managed payments service.</p>
<p>In addition, PayPal gained 11.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, to reach 403 million total active accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trevor Milton, the fast-talking showman founder of Nikola and the electric truck startup&#8217;s former CEO and executive chairman, has been charged with three counts of fraud.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Milton &#8220;</span>engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive retail investors&#8221; for his own personal benefit, according to the federal indictment unsealed by U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Manhattan on Thursday. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and wire fraud by a federal grand jury.</p>
<p>Specifically, prosecutors detailed in the complaint how Milton used social media and frequent appearances on television in a PR blitz that flooded &#8220;the market with false and misleading information about Nikola&#8221; before the company even produced a product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The charges reflect a fast and furious run for Nikola and Milton, who founded the company in 2015. Milton received more attention after unveiling the first prototype and boasted that the company would produce &#8220;the iPhone of trucking.&#8221; Promises around other products, including an electric pickup truck called Badger, would soon follow, as well as plans to build a factory in Arizona.</p>
<p>In March 2020, the company announced it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. Milton frequently posted on Twitter, directing his messages to retail investors after the company went public that summer. Then, in September, just days after GM had announced a $2 billion investment in the company, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Nikola of fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">opened an inquiry</a> in the matter and within two weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">Milton had stepped down</a> as executive chairman.</p>
<p>Nikola issued a statement Thursday that distances itself from Milton, who is still its largest shareholder.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trevor Milton resigned from Nikola on September 20, 2020 and has not been involved in the company’s operations or communications since that time. Today’s government actions are against Mr. Milton individually, and not against the company. <span class="m_5855769363247723133apple-converted-space"> </span>Nikola has cooperated with the government throughout the course of its inquiry. We remain committed to our previously announced milestones and timelines and are focused on delivering Nikola Tre battery-electric trucks later this year from the company’s manufacturing facilities.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Talkiatry raised a $20 million Series A to scale a strategy simple in theory yet potentially challenging in execution: bring psychiatry services in-network with insurance providers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://talkiatry.com/">Talkiatry</a> announced today that it has raised a $20 million Series A to scale a strategy simple in theory yet potentially challenging in execution: bring psychiatry services in-network with insurance providers. The round, led by Left Lane Capital with participation from the founder and former CEO of CityMD, Dr. Richard Park, is an extension of Talkiatry’s previously secured $5 million financing. That check was led by Sikwoo Capital Partners with participation from Relevance Ventures and Park.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Robert Krayn and Dr. Georgia Gaveras, Talkiatry is a digital health startup that helps consumers access in-network appointments with psychiatrists for therapy and medicine management. The company employs an ongoing care model in which it takes a consumer in through a virtual survey, matches them with a psychiatrist based on their needs, and then follows the consumer through the care process from diagnosing symptoms to the actual prescription of medicine.</p>
<p>The startup’s true innovation lies in its plan to make psychiatric services covered by insurance providers for consumers. Many plans today don’t cover mental health services beyond a certain point &#8212; and at the same time, many high-quality psychiatrists don’t participate in private insurance plans because of minimal reimbursement and paperwork nightmares. As a result, the psychiatrists that are in-network may be consumed with patients, and the ones at private practices could have a price of up to $300 per session.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s many people who have identified the problem that [psychiatrists are not accessible],” said Krayn. “What the issue comes to next is are they really, really solving the problem, or are they working around it?”</p>
<p>Krayn explained how startups have turned to hiring therapists and nurse practitioners as replacements for psychiatrists, which he thinks decreases the clinical quality of care (the difference between a therapist and psychiatrist is that the latter can prescribe medication). He said his competitors have also focused more on lessening the out-of-pocket costs instead of avoiding them altogether.</p>
<p>“While that does increase access to mental health, we think that that necessarily doesn&#8217;t give the most amount of access to solve a real problem, which is that psychiatrists are not accessible,” he said.</p>
<p>Talkiatry has partnered <a href="https://talkiatry.com/insurance/">with a number of insurance providers</a> including United Healthcare, Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield and more. While companies like Cerebral, Headway and Uplit have similarly gone in-network, the co-founder argues that it has the least restrictive relationship with providers, meaning that consumers won’t have to pay out of pocket for anything outside of the typical copay.</p>
<p>“Sure, some platforms are offered as an added benefit in addition to a health insurance plan, but may have additional restrictions, i.e., a patient may get access to the platform but still pay a monthly fee to get service. Others may only be allowed a certain number of visits and some may only be available if your employer decides to offer it in addition,” he said. “Talkiatry has none of these restrictions and can be used like any other in-network doctor you typically go to.”</p>
<p>Stability among its supply of psychiatrists is key here. Talkiatry has hired psychiatrists as W-2 employees instead of contractors. By not using a contractor model, Talkiatry will have more stability in its services but could struggle with scale. The startup will rapidly and consistently hire psychiatrists with varying backgrounds to serve consumers. Plus, in order to expand into new markets, Talkiatry has to go through the arduous legal process of local licensing requirements, instead of just going to a white-label solution that helps staff similar companies while offloading individual practitioner certification.</p>
<p>While Ginger, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/on-demand-mental-health-service-provider-ginger-raises-50-million/">well-capitalized growth stage company</a>, and Lyra Health, <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/mental-health-startup-lyra-health-now-worth-4-6b-latest-megaround#:~:text=Mental%20health%20startup%20Lyra%20Health%20now%20worth%20%244.6B%20with%20latest%20megaround,-by%20Heather%20Landi&amp;text=High%2Dflying%20startup%20Lyra%20Health,raised%20%24680%20million%20to%20date.">a digital health unicorn last valued at $4.6 billion</a>, have recently made waves in the behavioral health space, Talkiatry is confident that it can break into the sector, which continues to attract <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/healthcare-trends-q1-2021/">record amounts of venture </a>capital from investors.</p>
<p>Its competition is paying attention. For example, Ginger has made more efforts to bring in-network mental health solutions to users, recently partnering with AmeriHealth Caritas District of Columbia and Cigna.</p>
<p>“Providing psychiatry in-network is one avenue to ensure people receive care, but it still does not solve the supply-demand imbalance in the mental healthcare space,” said Russell Glass, Ginger CEO and co-founder. He explained how Ginger’s product being on-demand and virtual helps it address the growing shortage of mental health providers, which will be a hurdle that Talkiatry will need to address, too.</p>
<p>Currently, Talkiatry has 44 clinicians on its platform, with 33 as psychiatrists and the remaining as nurse practitioners. It has done 30,000 visits since its launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Developer marketing came up in our conversation with strategic marketing firm MKT1, so we called on content marketing production company Draft.dev's CEO Karl Hughes to learn more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developers can be a tough crowd. They typically hate being marketed to and are often short on time, which sets a particularly high bar for any content marketing aimed at them.</p>
<p>Coming up with relevant content that developers find interesting takes specific know-how, and this is where <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a> comes in. Its Chicago-based founder and CEO <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/">Karl Hughes</a> describes the firm as &#8220;a superniche content marketing production company, producing technical content for companies that want to reach software engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hughes and his agency were recommended multiple times in our growth marketer survey, which we launched to surface experts that startups can work with. (If you have your own recommendation, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out the survey</a>!) One of the survey respondents noted that developers are underrated as a target audience: It may be niche, but it is a large one. More importantly, they are an audience a growing number of startups need to reach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			&#8220;If you are going to have subject matter experts write, you also need to have good editors to work with them.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Developer marketing came up in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/mkt1-developer-marketing-is-what-startup-marketing-should-look-like/">our conversation with strategic marketing firm MKT1</a>, so we called on Hughes to learn more. Our discussion covered a lot of ground, from what he has learned and his ambitions to Draft.dev&#8217;s process.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity:</em></p>
<p><b>What kind of clients does Draft.dev work with?</b></p>
<p><strong>Karl Hughes: </strong>Almost all of our clients are developer tools companies. Mostly Series A- and Series B-funded, so they have got some funding and some knowledge that content marketing works for their audience. What they are trying to do with us is scale production and make sure that what they are writing is going to resonate with developers.</p>
<p><b>What inspired you to create Draft.dev?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a software developer, and then most recently was a CTO at a startup in Chicago, so I knew that there were lots of companies trying to reach developers [ … ] and that a lot of them were doing a poor job of it. So last year I wanted to combine my tech knowledge with writing knowledge, and that&#8217;s where Draft.dev came from — and it&#8217;s been awesome!</p>
<p>We get to work both with technical and non-technical marketing and developer relations people to help them get more content out. And even though it&#8217;s marketing content, it&#8217;s super focused on education, because developer marketing is a bit tricky. Developers can be a bit skeptical of marketing, so you have to be nuanced in your approach. You have to be genuinely helpful, so we really try to focus on helpful content that is also a net positive for the client.</p>
<p><b>What are some mistakes that you see companies making when creating content for developers?</b></p>
<p>There are a couple of big challenges that Draft.dev is specifically built to solve: Relying too much on your own team to create content when they are busy and have other priorities, and thinking that you can just get your general copywriting agency to cover developer topics. It usually doesn&#8217;t work well.</p>
<p>Many companies start off getting their engineers to write content and make the mistake of thinking this will work forever. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a continuous integration tool and you want to write content that shows developers how your tool works and that it&#8217;s a good option. Marketing teams will go to developers and say: &#8220;Hey, could you guys write a blog post?&#8221; And they&#8217;ll usually get a few blog posts here and there, but it&#8217;s really hard to build consistent content when these engineers are building the product and have production deadlines to hit.</p>
<p>When you look at companies that have done developer marketing really successfully, like Okta and DigitalOcean, you see that they have dedicated teams to produce this content. There&#8217;s a reason for that: It&#8217;s almost impossible to get your engineers to write everything that you need to produce high-quality and consistent content over time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4tMmvMG8bm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/okta-launches-a-new-free-developer-plan/">Okta launches a new free developer plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta launches a new free developer plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/okta-launches-a-new-free-developer-plan/embed/#?secret=4tMmvMG8bm" data-secret="4tMmvMG8bm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other big mistake that I see companies making is thinking that a general marketing writer or SEO copywriter can write great content for developers. That is super rare. I mean, I&#8217;ve probably met two or three who can do a decent job of making it look like they know enough to speak with some authority. In general, you either want somebody — either at your company or otherwise — who knows the tool.</p>
<p>So for example, if I ask a general SEO copywriter, &#8220;Could you write about how to write a SQL query that does X, Y and Z?&#8221;, maybe they can hack some other articles together and come up with something, but it&#8217;s certainly not going to have the authority that a real software developer has.</p>
<p>This is true in any area where you have to rely on subject matter experts to help you with marketing content, but because my background is in development, I knew that this was a huge problem for companies.</p>
<p><b>How does Draft.dev address that?</b></p>
<p>We are definitely not right for every company. But for companies that are looking to scale-up content production and have technical authority behind those pieces, that&#8217;s where we come in. Typically, these are companies that know they want to do developer content, but are stretched too thin on their engineering team or they have tried freelancers and have a really hard time managing them and keeping quality consistent. So they come to us to do that.</p>
<p>We solve that problem with a huge pool of software developers who write for us on the side. Right now we have about 50 or 60 active monthly writers who are all software developers; they work full-time jobs and do this at night and on weekends. We bring people who are actually in the field, doing these things every day. They bring that technical expertise to the articles that we create for clients.</p>
<p>The mutually beneficial aspect here is that while we obviously pay these writers, they also get a byline out on the client&#8217;s site. We don&#8217;t do a lot of ghostwriting, which is a little unique, but is really good for our style of content because you want to show subject matter expertise. It&#8217;s preferable when you don&#8217;t have your head of marketing listed as the author of every piece of developer content. It&#8217;s nice to have a byline by a real software developer.</p>
<p>All of this goes back to what your content strategy is and who you want to reach. This is not blanket advice for everybody, but for companies trying to reach developers who are writing code every day, I think it&#8217;s super helpful to have some technical authority from people actually doing this.</p>
<p><b>How do you make sure your writers have subject matter expertise?</b></p>
<p>We have a writer vetting and selection process. Once we have vetted the writers who have applied, we also look for the best match for each article. We are looking through their skills and past experience to see who&#8217;d be the best fit.</p>
<p>We also recruit specific writers to write about niche topics. Sometimes that means doing cold outreach; sometimes it means going through our networks and figuring out who we know who&#8217;s written about Rust before. Things like that can be really tricky and time-consuming for a marketing team to do, but because we are doing this full time for lots of clients, we can spread that work around. It makes a lot of sense, and our clients like that we do this for them.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;“Developers, as you know, do not like to pay for things”&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/embed/#?secret=CWRfqsYS4l" data-secret="CWRfqsYS4l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>How to you balance your writers&#8217; technical expertise versus writing skills?</b></p>
<p>That is tough! But there are some best practices in this field. If you are going to have subject matter experts write, you also need to have good editors to work with them.</p>
<p>There are two sides to how we get high-quality content from software engineers who may be average writers when they start, and are often ESL speakers. The upfront part is that we plan content pretty thoroughly. We go back and forth with the content to make sure we know what we are producing, and we also have technical content planners who make sure that each article has a story, an outline and lot of structure before we give it to a writer.</p>
<p>The writer fills in the technical details and personal experience, and then every piece will go through three rounds of edits to get it up to our standards: a technical review; a developmental edit for things like structure and flow, and a copy edit.</p>
<p><b>How do you split these tasks?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve refined this process a lot since starting this [in May 2020]. Initially, it was just me and my managing editor Chris [Wolfgang] — she had a lot of experience in editing, so she could do full-stack editing, and I was focused on writing, picking writers, reviewing, etc. That&#8217;s how we divided things in the early days, but as we grew, we realized that we wouldn&#8217;t find an army of Chrises and Karls.</p>
<p>We had to figure out how to split these jobs into specialities where people can do their best work, and that&#8217;s how we managed to scale and keep quality high while growing at the pace we have. We now have five full-time people and we work with over 35 startups of various sizes, so we are still a small business, but it has been growing very quickly.</p>
<p><b>How do you get new clients?</b></p>
<p>Our biggest source of new business has been referrals. Clients who work with us love what we do and refer us to other people. We have also ended up working with companies going through accelerator programs like Y Combinator, so when new YC companies ask who does developer content, they hear about us. Besides us there&#8217;s probably just a couple of other companies that specialize in this. It&#8217;s a very small field so we get mentioned a lot.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Growth has been so organic at the moment that I haven&#8217;t pursued a lot of active outreach strategies, but we are starting to get better at boosting this [organic growth]. One of the first hires I made this year was an account manager who&#8217;s helped with maintaining relationships with existing clients and getting things like testimonials, case studies, etc. Another thing is that when people see our content, they ask the company who did it, because companies that are selling developers tools really need a way to produce this kind of content, and there aren&#8217;t many providers.</p>
<p><b>How do you complement your clients&#8217; own content production efforts?</b></p>
<p>Our two sweet spots are bigger companies that are looking to augment their in-house content team, because they have a hard time keeping developer content going, and really small teams that are building a tool specifically for software developers and need to get going with content production or ramp it up.</p>
<p>A lot of our clients will have something like a community writer program in addition to what we provide. For instance, we work with Strapi, which is an open-source tool that has a big community with community writers writing about how they use Strapi.</p>
<p>But then they use us to augment that content, because they want to be able to set some topics themselves. A lot of times, community contributions are good for whatever your community happens to be working on, but you can&#8217;t necessarily ask your community to write about X or Y.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GQPho6gT3c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/headless-cms-company-strapi-raises-another-10-million/">Headless CMS company Strapi raises another $10 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Headless CMS company Strapi raises another $10 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/headless-cms-company-strapi-raises-another-10-million/embed/#?secret=GQPho6gT3c" data-secret="GQPho6gT3c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other challenge here is that with any developer-focused community writing program, you are going to need to spend a lot on editing. A lot of companies underestimate the work it is going to take. That&#8217;s where we come in: Instead of hiring all these different people you need and trying to build your own process, you can slot Draft.dev in there for a while. If some day you want to go hire your own team and replace us, that&#8217;s great — we&#8217;d love you to outgrow us. But ideally, we&#8217;d like to stick around and always be part of your developer content efforts.</p>
<p><b>Do you also do anything related to content distribution, such as writing the tweets that go with the articles?</b></p>
<p>We just started doing that; it&#8217;s our first big add-on service, where for each piece of content we&#8217;ll create social media collateral, like a couple of tweets, LinkedIn posts and Reddit submissions with the subreddits they would be most appropriate for. Then the client just has someone on their team copy-paste and schedule it with whatever system they want.</p>
<p>We also send a full promotional checklist they can use to promote the content, because one of the challenges I see with some of the smaller companies we work with is that they sometimes get lost when it comes to getting the content we produce in front of people. If you are not a developer, it&#8217;s hard to come up with copy about a technical piece. So by offering that collateral, we&#8217;re making it a bit easier. It&#8217;s been our first foray into this. We could expand into other things in the future, but that would probably be next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Satellite connectivity company Swarm&#8217;s new product will give anyone the ability to create a messaging or Internet of Things (IoT) device, whether that be a hiker looking to stay connected off the grid or a hobbyist wanting to track the weather.</p>
<p>The Swarm Evaluation Kit is an all-in-one product that includes a Swarm Tile, the company’s flagship modem device, a VHF antenna, a small solar panel, a tripod, a Feather S2 development board and an OLED from Adafruit. The entire kit comes in at less than 6 pounds and costs $499. The package may sound intimidatingly technical, but Swarm CEO Sara Spangelo explained to TechCrunch that it was designed to be user-friendly, from the most novice consumer all the way through to more advanced users.</p>
<p>It “was super intentional to call it an evaluation kit because it’s not a finished product,” Spangelo explained. “It serves two different kinds of groups. The first group is people that want to be able to do messaging anywhere that they are on the planet for a really low cost. &#8230; The second group of people will be the tinkerers and the hobbyists and educational folks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This is the second consumer product for Swarm &#8212; it went commercially live with its flagship Swarm Tile earlier this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/swarms-low-cost-satellite-data-network-is-now-available-to-commercial-clients/">The Swarm Tile</a> is a key part of the company’s ecosystem, which includes a few different components: the Tile, a kind of modem that can be embedded in different things and what the customer interfaces with; the satellite network; and a ground station network, which is how the company downlinks data. The Tile is designed for maximum compatibility, so Swarm serves customers across sectors including shipping, logistics and agriculture.</p>
<p>“One of the cool things about Swarm is that we&#8217;re infrastructure,” she said. “We&#8217;re like cellphone towers, so anyone can use us across any vertical.” Some of the use cases she highlighted included customers using Tile in soil moisture sensors, or in asset tracking in the trucking industry.</p>

<p>A major part of Swarm’s business model is its low cost, with a Swarm Tile costing $119 and the connectivity service available for only $5 per month per connected device. Spangelo credits not only the engineering innovations in the tiny devices and satellites, but the gains in launch economics, especially for small satellite developers like Swarm. The company also sells direct, which further reduces overhead.</p>
<p>Swarm was founded by Spangelo, a pilot and aerospace engineering Ph.D. who spent time at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab and at Google on its drone delivery project, Wing. She told TechCrunch that Swarm started as a hobby project between her and co-founder Ben Longmier, who had previously founded a company called Aether Industries that made high-altitude balloon platforms.</p>
<p>“Then [we] realized that we could do communications at speeds that were similar to what the legacy players are doing today,” Spangelo said. “There was a lot of buzz around connectivity,” she added, noting that initiatives like Project Loon were garnering a lot of funding. But instead of trying to match the size and scale of some of these multi-year projects, they decided to go small.</p>
<p>In the four and a half years since the company’s founding, Swarm has put up a network of 120 sandwich-sized satellites into low Earth orbit and grown its workforce to 32 people. They’ve also been busy onboarding customers that use the Tile. One hope is that the kit will be an additional way to draw customers to Swarm’s service.</p>
<p>Spangelo said the kit is for “everybody in between, that likes to just play with things. And it&#8217;s not just playing &#8212; the playing leads to innovations and ideas, and then it gets deployed out into the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Divorce is messy and stressful, made even messier and stressful when a couple is unable to go through the legal process because of the cost. Online divorce startup Hello Divorce is developing a platform to make this process more affordable and quicker.</p>
<p>To do this, the Oakland, California-based company announced Thursday a $2 million seed round led by CEAS, with additional funds coming from Lightbank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Gaingels and a group of individuals including Clio CEO Jack Newton, WRG’s Lisa Stone and Equity ESQ led by Ed Diab.</p>
<p>Statistics show there are an average of <a href="https://legaljobs.io/blog/divorce-rate-in-america/">750,000 divorces in the U.S. each year</a>, and the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/money/2020/01/21/divorce-us-heres-how-much-costs-separate-each-state/4502754002/">average total cost of divorce</a> can cost anywhere between $8,400 to $17,500 depending on what state you live in. Overall, some sources value the <a href="https://video.vice.com/en_us/topic/conscious-uncoupling">divorce industry at $50 billion</a> annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Family law attorney Erin Levine founded the company in 2018 so that couples getting a divorce could access “affordable meaningful legal counsel” and resources beyond online forms. Levine told TechCrunch that the billable hours model for lawyers is “an antiquated process” for consumers that want an easier and clearer path to divorce.</p>
<p>“Right now, lawyers are the keeper of information, and clients keep paying until the divorce is done,” she said. “Divorce is more than forms. It is a challenging time, and most people need or want support. I saw a big hole there to use technology and fixed fees to put couples in the driver’s seat and take down that level of conflict.”</p>
<p>With this seed round, the company plans on rapidly scaling legal filing options across the U.S., improving its ground-breaking product, and giving consumers more of the content and services they need to feel informed and in control of their divorce process.</p>
<p>Hello Divorce provides software and accessible legal services starting at $99 for a do-it-yourself option or for up to an average of $2,000 for legal help along the way to finish the divorce process in a third of the time, and completely remote.</p>
<p>Levine said most people spend between two and five years contemplating divorce, and during that time are scared they will not be able to afford it, and if they have children, are afraid of losing them. Of those people, 80% won’t be able to access counsel.</p>
<p>Though the company is already profitable, Levine went after venture capital to be able to build an infrastructure and tap into the guidance that CEAS and other investors, like Lightbank’s Eric Ong bring to the table, saying “it is clear what I do know and what I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Ong said he met Levine through co-investors on the round, who told him Hello Divorce was something he would resonate with. Lightbank invests in category-stage companies, and he was drawn to what Levine and her team were doing.</p>
<p>“They are a combination of industry expertise and thinking outside of the box,” he said. “Eighty percent of people are still not getting meaningful representation, and we looked for technology that would provide a customer value proposition and we didn’t find one until Hello Divorce.”</p>
<p>The company plans to use the seed funding to scale legal filing options across the U.S., on product development and new content and services to educate people coming to Hello Divorce’s website.</p>
<p>The service is already available in four states — California, Colorado, Texas and Utah. Levine said the choice of initial states was strategic: She is familiar with California law, while Colorado has a complex system for divorce. Texas does not have a streamlined way for same-sex couples to get divorces, something Levine said she wanted to tackle, and Utah has a new regulatory scheme. Up next, she is expanding to New York and Florida, where she will launch in a bilingual format.</p>
<p>Since 2018, Hello Divorce has grown 100% year over year, with divorce success rates of 95% after starting the process on the platform. Over the past year, the company received 2,000 inquiries related to how to shelter in place with someone while contemplating divorce and co-parenting during lockdown.</p>
<p>“The inquiries increased about staying or going, and what divorce will look like,” Levine said. “It will be awhile before we see the total effects of what divorce looks like following the pandemic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year after voice-based AI technology company <a href="https://www.conversenow.ai">ConverseNow</a> raised a $3.3 million seed round, the company is back with a cash infusion of $15 million in Series A funding in a round led by Craft Ventures.</p>
<p>The Austin-based company’s AI voice ordering assistants George and Becky work inside quick-serve restaurants to take orders via phone, chat, drive-thru and self-service kiosks, freeing up staff to concentrate on food preparation and customer service.</p>
<p>Joining Craft in the Series A round were LiveOak Venture Partners, Tensility Venture Partners, Knoll Ventures, Bala Investments, 2048 Ventures, Bridge Investments, Moneta Ventures and angel investors Federico Castellucci and Ashish Gupta. This new investment brings ConverseNow’s total funding to $18.3 million, Vinay Shukla, co-founder and CEO of ConverseNow, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Bryan Rosenblatt, partner at Craft Ventures, is joining the company’s board of directors, and said in a written statement that “post-pandemic, quick-service restaurants are primed for digital transformation, and we see a unique opportunity for ConverseNow to become a driving force in the space.”</p>
<p>At the time when ConverseNow raised its seed funding in 2020, it was piloting its technology in just a handful of stores. Today, it is live in over 750 stores and grew seven times in revenue and five times in headcount.</p>
<p>Restaurants were some of the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic, and as they reopen, Shukla said their two main problems will be labor and supply chain, and “that is where our technology intersects.”</p>
<p>The AI assistants are able to step in during peak times when workers are busy to help take orders so that customers are not waiting to place their orders, or calls get dropped or abandoned, something Shukla said happens often.</p>
<p>It can also drive more business. ConverseNow said it is shown to increase average orders by 23% and revenue by 20%, while adding up to 12 hours of extra deployable labor time per store per week.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Rahul Aggarwal said more people prefer to order remotely, which has led to an increase in volume. However, the more workers have to multitask, the less focus they have on any one job.</p>
<p>“If you step into restaurants with ConverseNow, you see them reimagined,” Aggarwal said. “You find workers focusing on the job they like to do, which is preparing food. It is also driving better work balance, while on the customer side, you don’t have to wait in the queue. Operators have more time to churn orders, and service time comes down.”</p>
<p>ConverseNow is one of the startups within the global <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/restaurant-management-software-market">restaurant management software market</a> that is forecasted to reach $6.94 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research. Over the past year, startups in the space attracted both investors and acquirers. For example, point-of-sale software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lightspeed-acquires-upserve/">Lightspeed acquired Upserve</a> in December for $430 million. Earlier this year, Sunday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/sunday-raises-24-million-seed-round-to-build-a-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">raised $24 million</a> for its checkout technology.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable ConverseNow to continue developing its line-busting technology and invest in marketing, sales and product innovation. It will also be working on building a database from every conversation and onboarding new customers quicker, which involves inputting the initial menu.</p>
<p>By leveraging artificial intelligence, the company will be able to course-correct any inconsistencies, like background noise on a call, and better predict what a customer might be saying. It will also correct missing words and translate the order better. In the future, Shukla and Aggarwal also want the platform to be able to tell what is going on around the restaurant — what traffic is like, the weather and any menu promotions to drive upsell.</p>
