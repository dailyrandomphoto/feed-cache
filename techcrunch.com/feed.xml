										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service with more than 16 million users, is partnering with PayPal to expand its recently <a href="https://help.linktr.ee/en/support/solutions/articles/48001172633-what-are-commerce-links-">launched “Commerce Links” tools</a> for direct payment on Linktree globally. The Melbourne-based startup says creators in over 200 countries where PayPal operates can now accept payments through the transaction tools.</p>
<p>Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab. The new integration lets Linktree customers connect their PayPal account and receive payments from their followers or customers via PayPal, a debit card or a credit card. Linktree notes users can also access information regarding their transactions, payment conversion rate and more. The company says the available relevant data is meant to help creators manage their digital presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the creator economy grows, creators want new ways to collect payments and support from their audience with as little friction as possible,&#8221; said Linktree co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be collaborating with PayPal to further expand our solutions to our users globally and enable them to further manage and monetize their digital presence.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Link-in-bio&#8217; company Linktree raises $45M Series B for its social commerce features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/embed/#?secret=2ihvU0PhnQ" data-secret="2ihvU0PhnQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are two types of Commerce Links that creators can use to take payments from their followers and customers: A “Support Me Link” allows Linktree users to collect payments and donations from their visitors, while “Request Links” lets customers and followers request goods and services from creators directly from their Linktree profile.</p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with PayPal is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The partnership announcement comes days after Linktree announced its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html">acquisition of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli</a>. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">raised $45 million in Series B funding</a>. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">filed its form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this morning as the identity management provider takes the next step toward its IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company did not provide initial pricing for its shares, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FORG. The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., with the company being valued as high as $4 billion, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/digital-identity-startup-forgerock-files-ipo-as-losses-shrink">Bloomberg</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a significant uplift over the $730 million post-money value that</span><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had for the company after its last round in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity attacks against organizations of all sizes, the need to secure and manage user identities is of growing importance. Based in San Francisco, ForgeRock has raised $233 million in funding across multiple rounds. The company&#8217;s last round was a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$93.5 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in April 2020, which was led by Riverwood Capital alongside Accenture Ventures. At that time, CEO Fran Rosch told TechCrunch that the round would be the last before an IPO, which was also what former CEO Mike Ellis told us after the startup&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/identity-startup-forgerock-lands-88-million-series-d-investment/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$88 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the timing of its IPO might have been unclear over the last few years, the company has been on a positive trajectory for growth. In its</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543916/000119312521254144/d127368ds1.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ForgeRock reported that as of June 30, its annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $155 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While revenue is growing, losses are narrowing as the company reported a $20 million net loss down from $36 million a year ago. There certainly is a whole lot of room to grow, as the company estimates that the total global addressable market for identity services to be worth $71 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many competitors that ForgeRock faces is Okta, which went public in 2017 and has been growing in the years since. In March, Okta</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5 billion in a deal that</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a few eyebrows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another competitor is Ping Identity, which went public in 2019 and is also growing, reporting on August 4 that its ARR hit $279.6 million in its quarter ended June 30, for a 19% year-over-year gain. There have also been a few big exits in the space over the years, including Duo Security, which was</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Cisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $2.35 billion in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ForgeRock has a good access management tool and they continue to be a strong player in customer identity and access management (CIAM),” commented Michael Kelley, senior research director at Gartner.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley noted that in 2020, ForgeRock converted most of its core access management services to a SaaS delivery model, which helped the company catch up with the rest of the market that already offered access management as SaaS. Also last year the company expanded into identity governance, introducing a brand new identity, governance and administration (IGA) product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think one of the more interesting products that ForgeRock offers is ForgeRock Trees, which is a no-code/low-code orchestration tool for building complex authentication and authorization journeys for customers, which is particularly helpful in the CIAM market,” Kelly added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock was founded in 2010, but its roots go back even further to an open-source single sign-on project known as OpenSSO that was created by Sun Microsystems in 2005. When Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in early 2010, a number of its open-source efforts were left to languish, which is what led a number of former Sun employees to start ForgeRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, ForgeRock has expanded significantly beyond just providing a single sign-on to providing an identity platform that can handle consumer, enterprise and IoT use-cases. The company&#8217;s platform today handles identity and access management as well as identity governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to scale is a key selling point that ForgeRock makes in the S-1, noting that its platform can handle over 60,000 user-based access transactions per second per customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As of June 30, 2021, we had four customers with 100 million or more licensed identities, the company stated in the S-1. &#8220;Our ability to serve mission-critical needs in complex environments for large customers enables us to grow our base of large customers and expand within each of them. &#8220;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following its announcement late last month, Facebook’s new 128GB model of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Oculus Quest 2</a> is now available to buy. You can purchase the VR headset from the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:company’s website" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">company’s website</a> for the same $299 price as the previous 64GB base model. “Long story short? We’ve created this 128GB model so that players can easily store and access more games and apps on a single device,” Facebook says of the new variant.</p>
<p>Facebook announced the 128GB model at the same time it issued a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">voluntary recall of the Quest 2</a> to address an issue with the original face insert that came with the headset. The company temporarily stopped selling the Quest 2 for about a month so that it could add a new silicone face cover inside the box of each new unit. If you’re a current Quest 2 owner, you can request Facebook send you the new silicone cover by visiting the My Devices section of the account settings. The new 128GB model also comes with the silicone cover inside the box.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, spend management startup Ramp said it has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/"> raised a $300 million Series C</a> that valued it $3.9 billion. It also said it was acquiring Buyer, a “negotiation-as-a-service” platform that it believes will help customers save money on purchases and SaaS products.</p>
<p>The round and deal were announced just a week after competitor Brex shared news of its own acquisition — the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/"> $50 million purchase</a> of Israeli fintech startup Weav. That deal was made after Brex’s founders invested in Weav, which offers a &#8220;universal API for commerce platforms&#8221;.</p>
<p>From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days. As the market matures and feature sets begin to converge, the players are seeking to differentiate themselves from the competition.</p>
<p>But the point of interest here is these deals can tell us where both companies think they can provide and extract the most value from the market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			These differences come atop another layer of divergence between the two companies: While Brex has instituted a paid software tier of its service, Ramp has not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Earning more by spending less</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Ramp.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/"> Launched in 2019</a>, the company is a relative newcomer in the spend management category. But by all accounts, it’s producing some impressive growth numbers. As our colleague Mary Ann Azevedo<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/"> wrote this morning</a>:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2021, the company says it has seen its number of cardholders on its platform increase by 5x, with more than 2,000 businesses currently using Ramp as their “primary spend management solution.” The transaction volume on its corporate cards has tripled since April, when its last raise was announced. And, impressively, Ramp has seen its transaction volume increase year over year by 1,000%, according to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman.</p>
<p>Ramp&#8217;s focus has always been on helping its customers save money: It touts a 1.5% cashback reward for all purchases made through its cards, and says its dashboard helps businesses identify duplicitous subscriptions and license redundancies. Ramp also alerts customers when they can save money on annual vs. monthly subscriptions, which it says has led many customers to do away with established T&amp;E platforms like Concur or Expensify.</p>
<p>All told, the company claims that the average customer saves 3.3% per year on expenses after switching to its platform — and all that is before it brings Buyer into the fold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flockjay.com/">Flockjay</a>, a bootcamp startup that helps laid off people and job seekers break into tech, cut half of its own employees amid a broader pivot to a B2B SaaS platform, TechCrunch has learned from sources close to the company.</p>
<p>The layoffs impacted every nontechnical team at Flockjay, including admission advisers, biz ops and development, partnerships, recruiting and marketing professionals. An estimated 30 to 45 people were laid off via an all-hands meeting, which accounts for at least half of Flockjay’s full-time staff. A hiring list of those impacted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6835668009177235456/">has already been highly circulated on LinkedIn.</a></p>
<p>“As a mission-driven organization, we care deeply about our graduates not only landing jobs, but also earning promotions and becoming future leaders of their companies. We learned while growing how important it is to invest early in building scalable support for our alumni, the teams they are on, and all mission-aligned sales organizations to level the playing field,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/shaanh?lang=en">CEO Shaan Hathiramani</a> in a statement to TechCrunch. “That meant making the difficult but necessary decision to run our classes in a more limited capacity while we focus on building that platform. We recognize that this decision has real human consequences, especially considering how talented and tightknit our team is.”</p>
<p>The startup graduated from Y Combinator in 2019 with a simple goal: serve as an onramp for people to break into tech careers. Flockjay’s core offering is a 10-week sales training bootcamp that helps place graduates into sales jobs across tech companies — about 80% of the company’s students find a job within the first six months of graduation,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/"> the company said in January.</a> The graduates of the course, otherwise known as Flockjay Tech Fellows, make an average of $75,000 upon graduation.</p>
<p>This core offering will continue to function but in a limited capacity for now, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch. It will come at a cost to diverse talent. In a previous interview, Flockjay confirmed that roughly 40% of students don’t have a four-year college degree; half of the students identify as female or nonbinary, and half of the company’s students identify as Black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>As Hathiramani&#8217;s comment alludes to, the company has spent years training students on how to be competitive hires for sales teams, so assumedly, it has key insight on what tech companies need today from an infrastructure and human perspective. A B2B SaaS tool focused on sales operations and efficiency could bring Flockjay more predictable revenue and assumedly less labor-intensive work.</p>

<p>Layoffs could signal changing tides for the broader edtech industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/edtechs-next-mission-go-everywhere/">a sector revitalized by the pandemic.</a> While it is true that learners shifted online, there are still questions around what purpose non-accredited training programs, such as Flockjay, serve, one investor said. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">With so many options in the market,</a> users have optionality on what service they frequent — and the service may indeed be the one that has a flashy university partnership that validates their program and offers a safety net.</p>
<p>Flockjay’s struggles also put a spotlight on the highly scrutinized income-share agreements, ISAs. The financial instrument essentially allows students to avoid paying upfront fees to attend a bootcamp, and then ultimately pay back class fees through a percentage of their future income. While ISAs play a role in making education more accessible in the beginning, satisfying those agreements post-employment can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/">where the controversy begins around liability.</a> Lambda School, a well-known company in the tech bootcamp world, also uses ISAs. The startup announced that it would be doing a broader restructuring earlier this year, while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">laying off 65 of its employees.</a></p>
<p>Flockjay has raised $11 million in known ventures and capital to date. Since its founding, the startup has attracted investments from Serena Williams, Gabrielle Union and Will Smith, along with institutional investors including Lightspeed, Coatue, Y Combinator, eVentures, Salesforce Ventures, the Impact America Fund and Cleo Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> is a five-year-old, L.A.-based seed stage fund that has been funding mostly business-to-business startups, as well as fintech companies and a sprinkling of healthcare IT startups &#8212; as long as they don&#8217;t involve hardware or FDA approval.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s investors apparently think it&#8217;s doing a decent job. After raising $41 million for its debut fund, followed by a $77 million fund that Fika closed in 2019, the outfit is today announcing a third flagship fund with $160 million to invest, along with an opportunity-type fund with $35 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a major endorsement for such a young firm. Still, even with upwards of 10 promising portfolio companies &#8212; including Formative, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based platform for K-12 teachers to create assessments that raised<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/formative-a-student-learning-and-analytics-platform-raises-70m-to-challenge-the-summative-test-based-approach-to-education/"> $70 million</a> in June; Pipe, a Miami-based startup that lets companies sell their recurring revenue streams on its platform and raised $250 million at a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$2 billion valuation</a> in May; and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papaya Global</a>, an Israeli startup that&#8217;s sells payroll, hiring, onboarding and compliance service and raised <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/">$100 million</a> earlier this year &#8212; it&#8217;s getting harder right now to do what they do, say firm cofounders Eva Ho and TX Zhou. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time,&#8221; Ho offers.</p>
<p>We had a candid conversation with the pair yesterday, edited lightly for length below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is now one of the bigger seed-stage firms in L.A. What percentage of your investments are local?</strong></p>
<p>EH: We feel like we have a home court advantage here, so about 40% of our deals are here, then the rest are in markets like Seattle, New York, Boston, Austin, Chicago. We recently did a deal in Toronto because they have a nice AI community there. But we still very much believe in needing boots on the ground so go after geographies where we can fly to board meetings and be there physically to support [our founders] when they need us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your new flagship fund is more than twice the size of your last fund. How will that impact how much you invest?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TZ: Our check sizes will grow a bit in tandem with the market. As you know, seed rounds are now quite a bit larger. I think initial checks will be in the $1 million to $3 million range; with the last fund, we reserved up to $6 million per company and now we&#8217;ll reserve up to $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Tell us a little about investing in a market where everybody is a founder, and everyone is also an investor. </strong></p>
<p>EH: It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time. It feels like we&#8217;re running a marathon <em>and</em> trying to be in a sprint. We have to have the long view and make bets with that horizon in mind, but at the same time, the decisions for initial and follow-on rounds have gotten just a lot faster.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you continue to make good decisions when things are moving so fast?</strong></p>
<p>EH: The things we&#8217;ve been doing include increasing the size of the team and doing more work upfront on an industry so that we have more prepared mind coming in. But it continues to be a struggle because everything has been sort of compressed.</p>
<p>TZ: I think in the past, seed funds could get away with being pure generalists, even within sectors. But we&#8217;ve been forced over the last 12 months to really understand even more sub sectors within each of our verticals. For example, within fintech, we&#8217;ve kind of taken a deep dive in real estate and insurance, and that that helps us come into deals [prepared] given how fast they&#8217;re moving these days.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is the fastest deal you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: In the past, deals that we were looking at were getting done in two to three weeks; now the average time is probably a week to a week-and-a-half to make a final decision. I&#8217;d say the fastest we&#8217;ve moved is in five days, in a situation where we&#8217;ve known the entrepreneur for years so there was strong validation on a personal level. There was also good founder-market fit in terms of what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>EH: We just pull ourselves out of certain rounds that are moving [super fast] and/or valuation expectation upfront is just crazy. You see a lot of pre-seed rounds right now that are pre-product, pre-traction, pre-revenue that are done at $15 million or $20 million or $30 million post-money valuations. We&#8217;ll certainly flex for the right things, but there is just a lot of froth in the market right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: If the terms are right, are you funding pre-seed, pre-product, pre-traction teams?</strong></p>
<p>EH: To be very frank, we have moved a little earlier in some cases. In the first fund, we [invested about] 15% in pre-seed startups, which to us means very early product and very early traction and sometimes no traction. In fund two, we&#8217;ve invested maybe 25% in pre-seed deals because the really good founders who&#8217;ve been shown that they&#8217;re able to execute and have vision &#8212; they get snapped up quickly, so you have to adapt and evolve a bit and move downstream a little more. That said, I think almost all the companies we fund have some sort of [minimum viable product] and some initial design partners in place, even if they don&#8217;t have any meaningful revenues yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of your investments in your most recent fund have gone to repeat founders?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I&#8217;d say 15% to 20%. Obviously, we can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t limit ourselves to [serial entrepreneurs], but with repeat founders, deals move even faster than before.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the most absurd thing you&#8217;ve seen in this go-go market?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I think the most absurd thing we&#8217;ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you ever pass on a company because you&#8217;re not that excited about the rest of the cap table?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: The speed of deals has forced us to really quickly hone in on what we care about. In the past, we had the luxury of having this long laundry list of things we wanted to check off and in a positive way, we&#8217;ve been forced to hone in on the three to five things that we really care about for each deal.</p>
<p>The bigger challenge is that investors who decide in 30 minutes create unrealistic expectations by founders. Sometimes they expect everyone to process information that quickly, and I think what they&#8217;re missing is that these funds are not processing the information.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s one way you get founders to slow down and pay attention?</strong></p>
<p>TZ:  We actually give every founder that we&#8217;ve come close to making a decision on a complete list of every single founder that we&#8217;ve backed in the past with their contact information.</p>
<p>Initially, we did this to help us win deals, but I think very quickly founders get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to work with us, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every top investment bank is chasing Byju’s and nudging the most valuable Indian startup to seriously explore the public markets as soon as next year.</p>
<p>Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised $1.5 billion since the beginning of the pandemic last year, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">most recently valued at $16.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The banks’ excitement comes as the Indian public market has shown a glimpse of strong appetite for consumer tech stocks. Food delivery Zomato had a stellar $1.3 billion debut on Indian stock exchanges last month. Scores of other top startups including Paytm, PolicyBazaar, Nykaa, Ixigo and MobiKwik have also filed paperworks for their IPOs.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran (pictured above), the founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, has publicly suggested in the past that he may list the firm in two to three years. According to a senior executive, who wishes to not be named as the matter is private, and an investor, the startup has not set a concrete timeline for an IPO.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, odds of Byju’s raising again is high. The startup has received several inbound requests from investors to raise at a valuation of about $21.5 billion, the people said.</p>
<p>The startup has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it acquired Indian physical coaching institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a>. It has also acquired Great Learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">U.S.-based Epic</a>, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>As of early this year, Byju’s said it had amassed over 80 million users, 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s, which is profitable, is on track to generate revenue of $300 million in the U.S. this year (per Raveendran), and as high as $1.1 billion in revenue overall by the end of the calendar year, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Byju’s declined to comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston is benefiting from larger changes to the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global startup community is currently enjoying a period of fundraising success that may be unprecedented in the history of technology and venture capital. While this is happening around the world, few startup hubs in the world are reveling in a greater boost to their ability to attract capital than Boston.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. city is a traditional venture capital hub, but one that seemed to fall behind its domestic rivals Silicon Valley and New York City in recent years. However, data indicates that Boston’s startup activity in fundraising terms has reached a new, higher plateau, funneling record sums into the city’s upstart technology companies this year.</p>
<p>And, according to local investors, there could be room for further acceleration in capital disbursement.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Exchange wanted to better understand what&#8217;s driving Boston’s rapid-fire results, and discover if there is any particular need for caution or concern. Is the market overheated? According to local investors<a href="https://twitter.com/robgo"> Rob Go</a> from NextView, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieagoldstein">Jamie Goldstein</a> from Pillar VC, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilylyman">Lily Lyman</a> from Underscore and <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar">Sanjiv Kalevar</a> from OpenView, things may be more than warm, but Boston’s accelerating venture capital totals in 2021 are not based on FOMO or other potentially ephemeral trends.</p>
<p>Instead, Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region. And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.</p>
<p>Let’s talk data, and then hear from the investing crew about just what is going on over in Beantown.</p>
<h2>A record year in the making</h2>
<p>When discussing venture capital data, we often note that it is somewhat laggy, with rounds announced long after they are closed. In practice, this means that more recent data can undersell how a particular quarter has performed. With Boston’s 2021 thus far, all that we can say is that if this data includes normal venture capital lag, it will simply be all the more incredible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ispace, a Japanese space startup that aims to lead the development of a lunar economy, has unveiled its design for a large lander that could go to the moon as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based ispace said this next-gen lander, dubbed Series 2, would be used on the company’s third planned moon mission. The lander is both larger in size and payload capacity than the company’s first lander, coming in at around 9 feet tall and 14 feet wide including legs. The vehicle will be capable of carrying up to 500 kilograms to the moon’s surface and 2,000 kilograms to lunar orbit. Series 1, which will fly in 2022 and 2023, has a maximum payload capacity of only 30 kilograms.</p>
<p>Crucially, the new lander is designed to be able to survive the frigid lunar nighttime, possibly as long as a two-week stint on the moon’s surface. It’s also capable of landing on either the near or far side of the moon, including its polar regions.</p>
<p>The new lander has a few other features as well: It has multiple payload bays, and an advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system to ensure the craft sticks the landing on the moon&#8217;s surface. The GNC technology is being provided by engineering developer Draper, a company with a deep footprint in the space industry. Draper is also one of 14 eligible contractors for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>Ispace said in a statement that the lander has completed its preliminary design review; the next stage is manufacturing and assembly, which will be completed in partnership with General Atomics, a defense and aerospace technology company.</p>
<p>The partnership with Draper — a CLPS contractor — is key, as ispace wants its Series 2 to compete in the NASA program. “Over the next few months, we will work closely with Draper and General Atomics to prepare for the next NASA CLPS task order,” Kyle Acierno, CEO of ispace’s U.S.-based subsidiary, said.</p>
<p>Ispace is developing the next-gen lander out of its North American offices in Colorado, and it intends to also manufacture the vehicle in the United States. In the meanwhile, the company is still at work preparing for its first two lunar missions in 2022 and 2023. The company said the Series 1 lander is undergoing final assembly of the flight module at a facility in Germany owned by space launch company ArianeGroup. The customer manifest for the first mission is full, but ispace did say payload capacity is still available for the subsequent mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lander unveiling comes just weeks after ispace announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">the close</a> of a $46 million Series C funding round, capital it said at the time would go toward the second and third planned missions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re less than one month away from kicking off our flagship global event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. And we’re feeling the adrenaline rush that can only come when more than 10,000 startup icons, experts, founders, investors and makers gather to learn, inspire, connect, collaborate, compete and network.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Buy your pass here</a> and brace yourself for three full days of Disrupt.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at just some of the opportunities that can help you move the needle on your startup aspirations.</p>
<p>You’ll find plenty of startup action on two distinct stages. First up, the Disrupt main stage featuring in-depth interviews and panel discussions with a who’s-who of tech, policy and celebrity-slash-entrepreneurial talent — like Calendly CEO Tope Awotona, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and movie-star-turned-pot-businessman Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>The Extra Crunch stage is where you’ll find a deep bench of subject-matter experts sharing practical how-to content. You’ll take away actionable insights you can put into practice now — when you need it most. We’re talking essential topics like <strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars</strong> and <strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip of the tech iceberg:</strong> Check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> and don’t forget — your pass includes video-on-demand. You can relax knowing you won’t miss a single presentation.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the hundreds of innovative startups strutting their considerable stuff in Startup Alley, the virtual expo area. Dive into an ocean of opportunity — ask for a product demo, schedule a 1:1 video meeting or explore potential ways to collaborate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networking is a huge part of Disrupt, and you’ll find multiple ways to make valuable connections. Whether they happen spontaneously in our virtual event platform (the chat is where it’s at!) or curated meetups through CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform, you’ll meet smart, exciting people eager to make a business connection. Who knows where a simple conversation can lead?</p>
<p>Don’t miss Startup Battlefield — the epic pitch competition that launched big-name companies like Dropbox, Mint, TripIt, Vurb and many more. Top early-stage startups from around the world — from any country and industry — will compete for a shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. You might just catch the next unicorn in its pony stage. It’s more than thrilling — as noted by Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute:</p>
<blockquote><p>Watching the Startup Battlefield was fantastic. You could see the ingenuity and innovation happening in different technology spaces. Just looking at the sheer number of other pitch decks and hearing the judges tear them down and give feedback was very helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place September 21-23 — that’s less than a month away, folks! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass</a>, plan your schedule and get ready to join your people and move your business forward.</p>

Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a>, the company behind the Paxos Standard stablecoin (PAX), has <a href="https://www.paxos.com/the-digital-dollar-that-always-equals-a-dollar-paxos-standard-pax-is-now-pax-dollar-usdp/">announced</a> that it is changing the name of its crypto asset. Paxos Standard is now Pax Dollar, and you’ll soon be able to identify it on your favorite cryptocurrency exchange, wallet or explorer under the USDP ticker.</p>
<p>Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical to PAX. Like other stablecoins, USDP has been invented so that its value doesn’t fluctuate over time when you compare it to fiat currencies. The value of USDP is indexed to USD. At any point in time, one USDP is worth one USD.</p>
<p>Stablecoins provide many advantages. Sending money is as easy as moving crypto assets from one wallet to another. You don’t have to enter intermediary bank information, worry about local regulation, etc. Many people around the world don’t have bank accounts — stablecoins and cryptocurrency wallets could potentially become an alternative to traditional bank accounts.</p>
<p>You can also use stablecoins to take advantage of DeFi projects (decentralized finance). For instance, you can contribute to lending pools and earn interest from your stablecoin holdings.</p>
<p>In addition to USDP, other popular stablecoins include USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). As you can see, a naming convention has emerged over time. And Paxos says that it is changing the name of its stablecoin for this reason in particular.</p>
<p>Whenever Paxos issues new tokens, it stores some USD and USD equivalent in a bank account. Right now, Paxos <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">uses</a> US Treasury Bills with short maturities as USD equivalent. Auditing firms regularly check the company’s claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos tries to position itself as a company that is deeply committed to regulation. It has recently written <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">a report</a> highlighting the differences between USDP, USDC and USDT. According to the company, USDC and USDT shouldn’t be considered as regulated assets because of their reserves. Paxos wants to emerge as the most legitimate player in the space so that big corporate clients choose Paxos as their preferred partner.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Circle announced that USDC would <a href="https://www.centre.io/blog/usdc-reserves-composition">switch</a> to cash and cash equivalent for USDC reserves. I’m sure we’ll hear more from cryptocurrency companies and their stablecoin reserve strategies in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“In order to become a better writer, read your written words out loud.”</p>
<p>That’s one of the first, and best, writing tips I ever received. I always found the advice ironic because it required me to change the medium of my writing to become a better writer. Still, all these years later, it&#8217;s true: Vocalizing your words helps identify typos and incomplete thoughts, but also notice more subtle things like awkward turns of phrases or a weird rhythm in your sentence structure. Best of all, if you find yourself bored of your own text while reading out loud, you know readers will be, too.</p>
<p>This is all to say that writing, even for those who love writing, is a deeply human art built on top of non-obvious rules. While those complications don’t exactly scream for a tech solution, <a href="http://noredink.com">NoRedInk</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, has spent nearly a decade trying to help students get better at their writing through software.</p>
<p>NoRedInk announced today that its digital writing curriculum, which pairs adaptive learning with Mad Libs-style prompts, has helped it raise a $50 million Series B led by Susquehanna Growth Equity, with participation from True Ventures. Other investors in the company include GSV, Rethink Education and Kapor Capital.</p>
<p>The financing event comes nearly six years after its Series A, a signal that the company has ambition to scale meaningfully in the coming months and years. With millions more, though, NoRedInk has to address its biggest challenge: the intricacies of the subject matter that it wants to make simple.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffscheur"> Jeff Scheur</a> built NoRedInk in 2012 when he was an English teacher in Chicago. The site served as a way to help kids get more than &#8220;red ink&#8221; on their papers, a nod at how teachers often use red ink to mark corrections and suggestions on assignments.</p>
<p>“Kids get feedback on their paper and they have no idea what to do with it,” Scheur said. “They see the grade, but they tend to just throw it out … so I started building tools to figure out how to help [students] apply very difficult to learn skills that we expect kids to know, but don’t explicitly teach them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since launch, NoRedInk’s goal is to help students with writing skills ranging from how to structure an essay to how to cut fluff from their arguments to how to cite correctly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193365" style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193365" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png" alt="" width="865" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png 2182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=2048,1083 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193365" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>“One of the great challenges about teaching writing is that we want to demystify the process of becoming a great writer without reducing the art form of expression,” he said. “So that means providing kids with lots of targeted personalized practice, and helping them realize that there’s no one way to write.”</p>
<p>It thus makes sense that NoRedInk uses adaptive learning, an educational method that uses an algorithm to get inputs of learners, such as strength areas or preferences, to create an output that better meets them where they are. After asking students for their favorite characters and role models, NoRedInk creates personalized writing exercises targeting each student’s interests, then guides them through the writing process with light support.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193362" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193362" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png" alt="noredink" width="857" height="344" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png 6814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=1536,616 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=2048,821 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>Scheur described part of the goal of NoRedInk as “breaking down difficult to learn skills with various degrees of scaffolding.”</p>
<p>To date, more than 10 billion exercises have been completed on NoRedInk’s practice engine &#8212; which is data the company uses to underscore problem areas, shared struggles and potential blind spots of traditional curriculum for its districts.</p>
<p>NoRedInk has a free-but-limited version of its platform for teachers to try, but offers a full-fledged premium version that integrates with learning management systems and other classrooms to offer a school and district a view of progress.</p>
<p>As the business expands, NoRedInk might need to get deeper into drafts in order to win over market share. Will it ever play the role of suggesting tone the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/grammarly-raises-90m-at-over-1b-valuation-for-its-ai-based-grammar-and-writing-tools/">that AI-based grammar and writing unicorn Grammarly does</a>? For now, it appears not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grammarly is a great consumer app, it&#8217;s a modern-day version of Grammar spellcheck that Microsoft Word did all those years ago,&#8221; Scheur said. &#8220;NoRedInk is very different; it&#8217;s what schools and districts use to teach skills.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every time you turn around, someone new is winning the war in California around organizing workers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>Labor struck first when California legislators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/">passed</a> Assembly Bill 5, requiring all independent contractors working for gig economy companies to be reclassified as employees. That was expected to set off a chain reaction in state legislatures nationwide, until two things happened.</p>
<p>First, COVID-19 hit and quickly became all-encompassing, making it virtually impossible for lawmakers and regulators to focus on anything but surviving the pandemic. Second, Uber, Lyft, Instacart and others funded and voters approved Prop 22 in California, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">striking down</a> AB-5 and returning sharing economy workers to independent contractor status.</p>
<p>On the same day that Prop 22 passed, Democrats captured both chambers of Congress in Washington, but their margins were so slim (50-50 in the Senate and a nine-vote majority in the House), that federal legislative action on the issue was near impossible. Across the country, politicians read the tea leaves of Prop 22 and decided to mainly stay away. That kept the issue at bay during the 2021 state legislative sessions.</p>
<p>But the tide started to turn again this summer. First, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protecting+the+right+to+organize%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">PRO Act</a> in February 2021, stating that workers would be reclassified using an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/the-lobbying-is-fast-and-furious-as-gig-companies-seek-relief-from-pro-labor-supreme-court-ruling/">ABC test</a>, in addition to rolling back right-to-work laws in states and establishing monetary penalties for companies and executives who violate workers’ rights.</p>
<p>The bill handily passed the House in March, but has since stalled in the Senate, despite receiving a hearing and energetic support by high-profile senators including Bernie Sanders and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s appointees to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board are decidedly in favor of full-time-worker status. And now, a California Superior Court judge has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">ruled</a> Prop 22 unconstitutional, saying it violates the right of the state legislature to pass future laws around worker safety and status.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sharing economy companies are expected to appeal, and the case could <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/20/uber-lyft-prop-22-unconstitutional/">ultimately</a> wind up before the California Supreme Court.</p>
<p>So now what? The courts will ultimately determine the status of sharing economy workers in California, but since the decision will be about the specific legal parameters of California’s referendum process, it won’t determine the issue elsewhere. And despite noise from Washington, Congress isn’t passing the PRO Act any time soon (Democrats may try to include it in the reconciliation for the $3.5 trillion American Families Plan, but the odds of its survival are low). That means the action returns to the states.</p>
<p>New York is the biggest battleground outside of California. Democrats have amassed a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, and New York lacks a referendum vehicle to overturn state law.</p>
<p>Sharing economy workers are the biggest organizing opportunity for private sector unions in decades, and labor will use all of its influence to pass worker classification reform in 2022.</p>
<p>However, Kathy Hochul, New York’s new governor, is a moderate, and state legislators recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/uber-new-york-union-bill-is-dead-for-this-year-sponsor-says">abandoned</a> a half-baked plan brokered by gig companies to safeguard independent contractor status, indicating a resolution on the issue will likely take time.</p>
<p>Illinois is fertile ground for worker reclassification, too, but the state <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/lyft-won-big-in-california-now-its-set-its-sights-on-illinois/">remains</a> a question mark.</p>
<p>There’s also a chance of movement in Massachusetts, where gig companies are making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/">play</a> to establish a ballot initiative very similar to Prop 22. Legislators in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-covid-19-rules-have-paid-off-for-delivery-app-drivers-whats-next/">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/ab5-gig-worker-employees-independent-contractors-philadelphia-uber-lyft-20190911.html">Pennsylvania</a> have also signaled an interest in exploring the issue.</p>
<p>And just a few months after most state legislative sessions conclude next summer, we’ll hit the midterm elections, which could produce a Republican wave (especially in the House) that would yet again quash the chances of worker classification legislation passing anywhere.</p>
<p>In other words, this is going to ping back and forth for at least the next few years in the courts, in state legislatures, and in the halls of Congress and federal agencies. If you’re a sharing economy investor and you want this issue resolved once and for all, that peace of mind isn’t coming. And the market, rather than accepting that this will be an unresolved issue for the next few years, will probably overreact to each individual action, whether it’s a lower court ruling or a piece of legislation making its way through a state.</p>
<p>In reality, the answer is the same as it’s always been: Trying to shoehorn sharing economy workers into one of two existing categories &#8212; 1099 or W-2 &#8212; doesn’t work. We still need to recognize that the inherent nature of work has changed over the last decade, and we need to recognize that both parties &#8212; the sharing economy companies and the unions &#8212; are only looking out for their own interests and coffers at the expense of what’s best for actual workers.</p>
<p>California is not going to resolve this issue. It’s just swung back and forth from one extreme to another. Congress is not going to resolve this issue because it almost never resolves anything.</p>
<p>So the game comes down to states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts. It comes down to legislators and leaders trying to craft good public policy at the expense of their donors and supporters and Twitter followers &#8212; and then it comes down to their colleagues doing the same.</p>
<p>It means sacrificing politics for policy. That almost never happens. And it probably won’t happen here, either. So if you’re trying to game out where this issue is going, accept the uncertainty and expect that a thoughtful, smart resolution &#8212; locally or nationally &#8212; is unlikely. It’s a dissatisfying conclusion but, sadly, it epitomizes exactly where our politics stand today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A quick survey of many of the most highly valued electric vertical take-off and landing companies shows one thing in common: All of them are developing aircraft powered by batteries. But a growing suite of aviation companies, turned off by what they see as the energy density limitations of lithium-ion batteries, are turning instead to hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>This is where HyPoint comes in. The two-year-old company has been working with a number of eVTOL companies, like ZeroAvia, on air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell systems that it says have triple the power-to-weight ratio of traditional liquid-cooled hydrogen fuel cells. Now, the fuel cell developer is adding Piasecki Aircraft Corporation to its list of partners.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two companies is being minted with a $6.5 million multiphase development agreement for the design and certification of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Through the partnership, HyPoint aims to deliver five full-scale, 650 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell systems for ground testing, demo flights and the certification process.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system that has four times the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries, double the specific power of existing hydrogen fuel cell systems, and that costs up to 50% less relative to the operative costs of turbine-powered rotorcraft. HyPoint unveiled a prototype of the new technology in March.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193326" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193326" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg 2244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=2048,1084 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hypoint.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://hypoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HyPoint <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Through the deal, Piasecki will have exclusive license to the tech created as a result of the partnership. It aims to use the technology for use in its PA-890 manned helicopter, which it says would be the first hydrogen-powered helicopter on the market. HyPoint will maintain exclusive ownership of the fuel cell system.</p>
<p>The two companies said in a statement that they intend to make the system available to other eVTOL makers as well. “Piasecki is ready to support other eVTOL makers with Hypoint,” HyPoint CEO Alex Ivanenko told TechCrunch</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement started with a feasibility study, in which HyPoint created a very small-scale prototype to show proof-of-concept. Now, the company is in the design stage, at work building a single power module (each 650 kW system contains several), and an integration concept of the system in Piasecki’s aircraft. The single power module will be ready by the end of this year, with the first 650 kW system being delivered to Piasecki in 2023, and a commercially available product by around 2025.</p>

<p>The two companies have also developed a certification roadmap that outlines when HyPoint needs to deliver systems, to ensure that they’re ready for testing and demo flights with the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>“Our objective is to develop full-scale systems within two years to support on-aircraft certification testing in 2024 and fulfill existing customer orders for up to 325 units starting in 2025,” John Piasecki, CEO of Piasecki, said.</p>

<p>In a follow-up tweet, Chesky said Airbnb hosts who are willing to offer up their residences will soon be able to sign up to accommodate a refugee family fleeing Afghanistan. Airbnb plans on sharing more details on how hosts and the broader community can support the initiative. Chesky said he hopes Airbnb’s initiative will inspire other business leaders to do the same.</p>
<p>The company said it has already worked with partners to place 165 refugees in safe housing after reaching the U.S. this past weekend. Airbnb plans to work with resettlement agencies to evolve the initiative and provide support as necessary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airbnb’s initiative comes at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>. Since August 15, countries have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-evacuation-war-footing-g7-meets-pullout-deadline-2021-08-24/">evacuated around 58,700 people</a> from the country’s capital, Kabul.</p>
<p>“As tens of thousands of Afghan refugees resettle around the world, where they stay will be the first chapter in their new lives. For these 20,000 refugees, my hope is that the Airbnb community will provide them with not only a safe place to rest and start over, but also a warm welcome home,” Chesky said in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting Airbnb has historically provided free housing to those in need over the past few years. In 2017, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/airbnb-free-housing-immigration-ban/">company offered free housing</a> to stranded refugees, students and green card holders affected by former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html?">executive order</a> limiting refugees. More recently, Airbnb provided free or subsidized housing for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/airbnb-to-provide-free-or-subsidized-housing-for-100000-covid-19-healthcare-workers/">100,000 healthcare workers</a> amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Airbnb notes it has connected approximately 25,000 refugees to temporary housing over the past four years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based AI healthtech company, <a href="https://www.dia-analysis.com">DiA Imaging Analysis</a>, which is using deep learning and machine learning to automate analysis of ultrasound scans, has closed a $14 million Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Backers in the growth round, which comes three years after DiA last raised, include new investors Alchimia Ventures, Downing Ventures, ICON Fund, Philips and XTX Ventures &#8212; with existing investors also participating, including CE Ventures, Connecticut Innovations, Defta Partners, Mindset Ventures, and Dr Shmuel Cabilly. In total, it has taken in $25 million to date.</p>
<p>The latest financing will allow DiA to continue expanding its product range and go after new and expanded partnerships with ultrasound vendors, PACS/Healthcare IT companies, resellers and distributors while continuing to build out its presence across three regional markets.</p>
<p>The health tech company sells AI-powered support software to clinicians and healthcare professionals to help them capture and analyze ultrasound imagery &#8212; a process which, when done manually, requires human expertise to visually interpret scan data. So DiA touts its AI technology as &#8220;taking the subjectivity out of the manual and visual estimation processes being performed today&#8221;.</p>
<p>It has trained AIs to assess ultrasound imagery so as to automatically home in on key details or identify abnormalities &#8212; offering a range of products targeted at different clinical requirements associated with ultrasound analysis, including several focused on the heart (where its software can, for example, be used to measure and analyze aspects like ejection fraction; right ventricle size and function; plus perform detection assistance for coronary disease, among other offerings).</p>
<p>It also has a product that leverages ultrasound data to automate measurement of bladder volume.</p>
<p>DiA claims its AI software imitates the way the human eye detects borders and identifies motion &#8212; touting it as an advance over &#8220;subjective&#8221; human analysis that also brings speed and efficiency gains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our software tools are supporting tool for clinicians needing to both acquiring the right image and interpreting ultrasound data,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Hila Goldman-Aslan.</p>
<p>DiA&#8217;s AI-based analysis is being used in some 20 markets currently &#8212; including in North America and Europe (in China it also says a partner gained approval for use of its software as part of their own device) &#8212; with the company deploying a go-to-market strategy that involves working with channel partners (such as GE, Philips and Konica Minolta) which offer the software as an add on on their ultrasound or PACS systems.</p>
<p>Per Goldman-Aslan, some 3,000+ end-users have access to its software at this stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our technology is vendor neutral and cross-platform therefore runs on any ultrasound device or healthcare IT systems. That is why you can see we have more than 10 partnerships with both device companies as well as healthcare IT/PACS companies. There is no other startup in this space I know that has these capabilities, commercial traction or many FDA/CE AI-based solutions,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;Up to date we have 7 FDA/CE approved solutions for cardiac and abdominal areas and more are on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>An AI&#8217;s performance is of course only as good as the data set it&#8217;s been trained on. And in the healthcare space efficacy is an especially crucial factor &#8212; given that any bias in training data could lead to a flawed model which misdiagnoses or under/over-estimates disease risks in patient groups who were not well represented in the training data.</p>
<p>Asked about how its AIs were trained to be able to spot key details in ultrasound imagery, Goldman-Aslan told TechCrunch: &#8220;We have access to hundreds of thousands ultrasound images through many medical facilities therefore have the ability to move fast from one automatic area to another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We collect diverse population data with different pathology, as well as data from various devices,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Phrase &#8216;Garbage in Garbage out&#8217;. The key is not to bring garbage in,&#8221; she also told us. &#8220;Our data sets are tagged and classified by several physicians and technicians, each are experts with many years on experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have a strong rejection system that rejects images that was taken incorrectly. This is how we overcome the subjectivity of how data was acquired.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the FDA clearances obtained by DiA are 510(k) Class II approvals &#8212; and Goldman-Aslan confirmed to us that it has not (and does not intend) to apply for Premarket Approval (PMA) for its products from the FDA.</p>
<p>The 510(k) route is widely used for gaining approval for putting many types of medical devices into the U.S. market. However, it has been criticized as a light-touch regime &#8212; and certainly does not entail the same level of scrutiny as the more rigorous PMA process.</p>
<p>The wider point is that regulation of fast-developing AI technologies tends to lag behind developments in how they&#8217;re being applied &#8212; including as they push increasingly into the healthcare space where there&#8217;s certainly huge promise but also serious risks if they fail to live up to the glossy marketing &#8212; meaning there is still something of a gap between the promises made by device makers and how much regulatory oversight their tools actually get.</p>
<p>In the European Union, for example, the CE scheme &#8212; which sets out some health, safety and environmental standards for devices &#8212; can simply require a manufacturer to self declare conformity, without any independent verification they&#8217;re actually meeting the standards they claim, although some medical devices can require a degree of independent assessment of conformity under the CE scheme. But it&#8217;s not considered a rigorous regime for regulating the safety of novel technologies like AI.</p>
<p>Hence the EU is now working on introducing an additional layer of conformity assessments specifically for applications of AI deemed &#8220;high risk&#8221; &#8212; under the incoming Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>
<p>Healthcare use-cases, like DiA&#8217;s AI-based ultrasound analysis, would almost certainly fall under that classification so would face some additional regulatory requirements under the AIA. For now, though, the on-the-table proposal is being debated by EU co-legislators and a dedicated regulatory regime for risky applications of AI remains years out of coming into force in the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Waymo, the self-driving vehicle company under Alphabet, has launched a robotaxi service that will be open to certain vetted riders in San Francisco.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, the company officially kicked off its Waymo One Trusted Tester program in the city with a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">fifth generation of its autonomous vehicle system</a>. This AV system, which has been branded the Waymo Driver, is informed by 20 million self-driven miles on public roads and over 10 billion miles driven in simulation, according to Waymo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The so-called Waymo One Trusted Tester program mirrors the company&#8217;s strategy in Phoenix, where it rolled out its first commercial ride-hailing service several years ago. The Trusted Tester program is a rebranding of Waymo&#8217;s previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Early Rider Program</a> that it launched in Metro Phoenix in April 2017. Seeing as it&#8217;s been over four years, those riders are no longer exactly &#8220;early,&#8221; so a name change was in order, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Phoenix, Waymo eventually invited some of the early riders to move over to the Waymo One service, which let users publicly share their impressions on the service and invite friends or family member who weren&#8217;t part of the early rider program. Waymo then opened the service to everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">San Franciscans can download the Waymo One app and express their interest in joining the program, which will begin with an initial select group from diverse backgrounds with varied transportation needs, including wheelchair accessibility, according to Waymo. The company would not share how many riders would be included in the initial group, nor how many Jaguars it will have roaming the city, but it did say riders would have to be willing to offer a lot of detailed feedback on their riding experience and sign a nondisclosure agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo will encourage riders to use its autonomous service to help them with their everyday mobility needs. The rides are free for now, and will start out in an initial territory in parts of San Francisco, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the Sunset, Richmond, Pacific Heights, Noe Valley, the Castro, Haight-Ashbury and more, with expectations to expand over time. The service will be offered 24 hours per day, seven days per week, the spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company will have so-called &#8220;autonomous specialists&#8221; — another term for human safety operators — sitting in the front seat to monitor the ride and ensure a safe experience. These safety drivers are contract workers, and employed by Transdev. Waymo has long partnered with Transdev to provide staffing for some of its operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo&#8217;s rider support team will also be available at the tap of the button on the in-car screen or through the app if riders have any questions during their rides, the spokesperson said.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s first ride-hailing service launched in Phoenix, but its roots are in California, notably the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View. It&#8217;s been testing in the greater San Francisco Bay area for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The company began testing its robotaxi service by offering autonomous rides to its employees in the city earlier this year.</p>
<p>The news about the Trusted Tester launch comes a week after Waymo announced that it&#8217;s scaling up its Waymo Via autonomous trucking operations in Texas, Arizona and California, and is building a trucking hub outside of Dallas. The company has also been testing its fifth generation Driver on Class 8 trucks in Texas, hauling freight for carriers like J.B. Hunt, so this newest application of the Driver is a sign that Waymo is either succeeding at its push to full autonomy, or that it&#8217;s putting the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/">$2.5 billion</a> in funding to good use.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Greenfly is building a workflow to provide sourcing, creation and automated distribution of short-form photos and videos created for social media.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Greenfly’s latest funding round has a new face: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix Suns point guard </span>Chris Paul joined as a strategic investor and partner in the company, which developed digital media flow management software.</p>
<p>Paul’s investment is part of an $8.4 million strategic growth round that also includes Verance Capital, Higher Ground Labs, DD Venture Capital, SW19 Ventures, LinkinFirm and Allievo Capital, as well as existing investors Go4it Capital, Elysian Park Ventures, Alpha Edison and Iconica Partners.</p>
<p>The new round gives Los Angeles-based Greenfly over $23 million raised since the company was founded in 2014 by former Major League Baseball All-Star Shawn Green and his cousin Daniel Kirschner, who previously held senior roles at the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and Activision Blizzard.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GAS44XiZEp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/lebron-james-tweet/">LeBron Tweets, Blames Chris Paul For Making Him Sign Up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LeBron Tweets, Blames Chris Paul For Making Him Sign Up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/lebron-james-tweet/embed/#?secret=GAS44XiZEp" data-secret="GAS44XiZEp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Green and Kirschner saw how social media was driving new sources of revenue for organizations like sports teams, politics and consumer brands, but needed a way for real-time distribution of media to be easily shared. Kirschner explained that when Green first started in his career, there were times when he needed to provide feedback for a public moment, like when his home run record was tied, and it occurred to Green that they could build a mini media studio.</p>
<p>Paul, an 11-time National Basketball Association All-Star, was one of Greenfly&#8217;s early adopters, using the platform to share content to his social media channels following his games. However, Paul realized he was also sitting on valuable content within his phone, like game or event photos, but without a good system for easily accessing them or matching them to events going on at that moment. He considers Greenfly &#8220;instant access to a media gallery&#8221; that he can share on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>One of the best features, he explained, was seeing a post on social media with only two photos of an event, but while searching Greenfly, he came across 12 to 15 other photos that he had never seen. He believes the company will continue to grow, and as a partner, will work with Greenfly to build awareness for the platform and get other players involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer of creating memories and seeing photos,&#8221; Paul told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can go in and search for my name and Devin Booker&#8217;s and see photos of us playing together. The NBA uses Greenfly to automate the media and share with others. I love it because it makes it easy — you don’t want something hard and complicated.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of just repurposing materials, Greenfly will continue to build a workflow around events that provides sourcing, creation and automated distribution of photos and short-form videos created for social media.</p>
<p>Greenfly is also working on increased improvements to curate media most relevant to users, and is collecting data to provide more insights around that so that users can manage relationships with their community to amplify their messages. The new funding will go toward growth and expansion to build additional collaboration tools and content as more players sign on.</p>
<p>“With Chris, it is an opportunity to come at it from the athlete’s perspective,” Kirschner said. “Our deals are mainly with leagues and teams, so to be working with athletes, who are their own brands, enables us to be the system of record for all sides.”</p>
<p>The past year was a big growth period for the company, and it had been reaching a tipping point just prior to 2020, he added. Greenfly is now working with more than 30 sports leagues, including the NBA, Major League Baseball and World Surf League.</p>
<p>It also boasts over 500 organizations in sports, media and entertainment, political campaigns, social causes and consumer brands, and is experiencing over 100% growth so far in 2021, Kirschner said.</p>
<p>With social media evolving, the company is looking for more polished content because it learned that stories and intimate content performs better.</p>
<p>“We set out to build a content collaboration platform to provide content that athletes and others can share on social media and also manage that workflow around large, complex organizations,” he added. “Organizations have lots of content and we make that available through routing tools and curation, making it easy to find what you are looking for.”</p>
