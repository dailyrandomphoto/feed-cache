		Ariane de Bonvoisin is an executive coach to top CEOs, startup founders and VCs. She has keynoted the Oprah conference, given a TED talk, and been invited to Google, Amazon, the World Bank, Union Square Ventures and Red Bull to teach about navigating change and founder and startup wellness. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The business world has a love-hate relationship with coaching. Founders are visionaries: They start with an idea, a talent, a dream, but not necessarily the business know-how. Because being an entrepreneur doesn’t require a license or training — Jeff Bezos is an engineer and computer scientist; Elon Musk is an economist and physicist, and so on.</p>
<p>In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach. And it doesn’t stop once they get their first Olympic gold or Grammy.</p>
<p>Coaches don’t leave their side until they hang up their gloves. Tiger Woods is famous for having worked with many coaches to switch up his tactics and keep exceeding in his performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite a culture that pushes founders to the edge of their physical, mental and personal limits as they build their company, we insist that they fly solo. They’re led to believe that reaching out for support is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>That stigma is a huge part of the problem. We look up to business magnates, believing that they sailed from a college dorm to the C-suite without breaking a sweat. But we don’t see the vigorous kicking that goes on beneath the surface. As a client of mine once mused, even the best leaders are self-sabotaging themselves at least 30% of the time. I know for a fact that top Silicon Valley billionaires have nutrition, parenting, meditation and life coaches, but they — like half of my own clients — are reluctant to embrace this out in the open.</p>
<p>VCs know that they don’t invest in the business; they invest in the person.<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/access-to-mental-health-startups-tackle-sectors-complexities-as-investors-go-all-in/"> Record amounts</a> of money are being funneled into mental wellness startups right now, but investors also need to direct that awareness toward their founders&#8217; well-being. By offering access to a coach to all your portfolio founders, you’ll be tackling the real problems stopping them from pouring their energy into their business, and you’ll without a doubt improve your returns.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Business is not always a founder’s main problem</strong></h2>
<p>I coach founders and CEOs of startups, and more than half their main life challenges are <em>not</em> work related. They’re getting pulled in multiple directions — some have cancer, others are having an affair, a few are going through IVF, others still are dealing with past grief and traumas.</p>
<p>And when a problem is work related, it’s often a communication or psychological issue: How do I face my fear of failure? How do I lead a team of 50 for the first time? Should I trust my gut?</p>
<p>All this is happening in the midst of Series A raises, hiring and firing employees, acquisitions, and deciding whether to bridge or shut down the business. Imagine how much emotional energy and hours it takes for founders — or anyone, really — to face those intimate issues in isolation while putting on a brave face with investors or at board meetings.</p>
<p>One of the most recurring concerns founders share with me is that they feel alone.</p>

<p>VCs, when you choose to fund someone, you’re also marrying into their past, their family, their personal issues. The full package. Ask yourself — do you currently know the major distractions in the lives of all your portfolio founders? If you don’t, start with the assumption that something is going on in their life other than work and make coaching available to them at any time.</p>
<p>If you commit to helping founders manage their fears, limiting beliefs and blind spots, you’re committing to their potential as a company and industry leader. A healthy leadership is a healthy company.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Return on coaching (ROC)</strong></h2>
<p>As with elite soccer coaches, the benefits of business coaching are highly visible, without the million-dollar expense. Founders start to make better decisions the first time around. They hire the right talent, rather than hiring, onboarding and firing someone within a month.</p>
<p>They have more honest conversations with stakeholders, avoiding conflict and allowing more people to contribute meaningfully to the business’ growth. They have the proper mindset to fundraise, and their attitude matches the money they’re asking for.</p>
<p>That’s before getting to the physical improvements. My founders have lost weight, stopped smoking and drinking, and have more energy to build a business. If a founder works with chronic fatigue, which many are, it won’t be long before their body cracks. I get calls from clients caught in panic attacks before big meetings, struggling to steady their frayed nerves.</p>
<p>You can fund your founders’ well-being in a variety of ways. In the same way your firm might offer marketing or PR services to portfolio companies, coaching should be part of the package. Firms can make executive coaches available on retainer. You may choose to have a full-time resident coach, available whenever someone needs them.</p>
<p>At the very least, firms should make available a list of recommended coaches. Some coaches specialize in leadership coaching, female founders or health specifically, while others cover various personal and professional skills.</p>
<p>Investors will sometimes offer a handful of free sessions to their founders, but if they want to continue, they are then forced to decide between their personal health and the health of the business — which other people (including your firm) have staked millions of dollars on. It should never be a case of one or the other.</p>
<p>My hope is that in the future, VCs will set aside a percentage of their funds exclusively for mental wellness for founders and executives.</p>
<p>A few VCs have already taken a<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90461861/im-a-vc-and-this-is-how-im-investing-in-founders-mental-health"> 1% pledge</a>, but it’s the Europeans who are leading the charge here, with funds from Estonia to Ireland generously covering all founder coaching fees and other support programs. Those I know talk about how 10x growth is possible without burnout.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Cut through the stigma to enable founders to make the most of coaching</strong></h2>
<p>Founders are resistant to hiring a coach themselves because they’re worried about what their investors and board will think of them. They tell themselves: “If I were normal, and good enough, I wouldn’t need one.”</p>
<p>It’s not just their inner voice talking. When a client of mine joined a Silicon Valley startup, he asked his superiors if coaching could be part of his comp package. They wondered why he needed a coach.</p>
<p>In other industries, connecting someone with a coach is proof of their worth. That’s the conversation investors should be having: You’re good enough for us to give you money, so we’re going to give you someone to accompany you on your journey, so you don’t pretend you can figure it out at every step.</p>
<p>There’s also a negative connotation around the term “mental health” that we should be reframing. Those two words tend to make people think about depression, suicidal thoughts or addiction. Which is mental <em>un</em>health. Let’s talk more about mental wellness and founder well-being, which focuses us on the goal we’re working toward.</p>
<p>Eliminating the stigma can start with open conversations about well-being between investors and executives, as well as inviting a coach to talk to your founders about what these sessions entail, and why everyone has something to gain. By shattering the taboo, you’ll enable founders to make the absolute most of that experience, rather than hold back to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>If we start making coaching mainstream today, we might eventually see it as obligatory for all founders.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Lead by example</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, business leaders and investors need to set an example for the startup community, and especially people at the start of their journeys, that it’s OK to ask for assistance in bettering yourself.</p>
<p>Many VCs, like top CEOs, have coaches. If more simply owned it, they’d have so much power to normalize coaching, and even make #IHaveACoach fashionable. After all, we’re talking about the same industry that made meditation rooms trendy and kombucha an office feature.</p>
<p>Why not make coaching a central topic in future investor conferences, or, as a VC firm, publish a study on how portfolio founders who followed a coaching program saw greater business success?</p>
<p>For example: For years, Union Square Ventures has invested in providing value to their founders and has built a team whose responsibilities include developing leadership training, fostering mentorship circles and connecting founders to coaches. If you let founders see your commitment to human issues, it won’t occur to them that being human is being weak.</p>
<p>These approaches are also important self-promotion for VCs positioning themselves as the next generation of ethical investors. With so many alternative funding options becoming available, founders are seeking VCs who give them more than just capital and who see wellness and diversity and inclusion as inextricable from success.</p>
<p>Founder health and startup health can’t be separated from each other. On some level, all investors know this. So let’s give the people shaping tomorrow’s world the tools to be more comfortable in their own skin and more masterful in leading teams to achieve greatness and incredible returns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While it's not likely that we'll be driving around wearing VR headsets anytime soon, in-car AR is already changing the way we travel, and it promises to continue to evolve.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Augmented and virtual reality have been used for years in gaming, design and shopping. Now, a new battle for market share is emerging — inside vehicles.</p>
<p>Safety-glass windshields offer a new opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers and startups that are starting to adapt this technology: AR overlays digital information or images on what a user sees in the real world, while VR creates a seemingly real experience that changes as they move through it.</p>
<p>The potential for monetizing AR/VR is hamstrung by a number of factors: The long, expensive timelines required to develop, tool and test an automotive-grade product has constrained development to a small subset of startups and several large suppliers.</p>
<p>And despite all of the pomp and promises about the technology&#8217;s potential, there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing AR and VR to cars, trucks and passenger vans. Estimates of the global market range from <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/virtual-reality-vr-in-automotive-market-101702">$14 billion by 2027</a> to as much as <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/automotive-ar-and-vr-market">$673 billion by 2025</a>. That wide range shows just how nascent the market currently is and how much opportunity is present.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the vehicle manufacturer level, companies are witnessing a complete shift of emphasis of what their product offering is, to the user. Because of that change of emphasis, there&#8217;s a whole new paradigm of what the car is,&#8221; said Andy Travers, the CEO of Ceres, a Scottish company that specializes in creating holographic glass for AR applications. &#8220;There is a huge interest in AR and transparent displays because a car is no longer really differentiated by its engine size, especially as we get into electric vehicles. They are going to be identical skateboards. The question then becomes, how do you differentiate an electric car? You push it toward the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that the implementation of automotive AR (and in limited situations, VR) has been and will continue to be slow. It will largely lag the wider AR and VR market for a number of reasons. Vehicle systems &#8212; especially those using computing power and technology needed for AR and VR &#8212; must be robust enough to handle tremendous temperature swings, rough jostling and impacts over anywhere from three to 10 years, even if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/tesla-recalls-135000-vehicles-over-touchscreen-failures/">Tesla says that</a> &#8220;it is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle&#8217;s entire useful life.&#8221;</p>
<p>These systems have to be nearly indestructible in extreme conditions for a very long period of time. They must also be compact and power-efficient, especially as electric vehicles become more prevalent. You don&#8217;t want your AR or VR system draining your battery and leaving you stranded.</p>
<p>As an example of just how much the automotive technology landscape differs from the consumer realm, consider how long it took for touchscreens to show up in vehicle cockpits. While Buick offered a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/first-car-with-touchscreen-infotainment/">rudimentary touchscreen</a> in its 1986 Riviera, it was not the easy-to-use interface we&#8217;re used to today thanks to the advent of the iPhone.</p>
<p>This is partially due to the three- to seven-year iteration cycles most vehicle makers are on and because the technology simply wasn&#8217;t familiar enough to the consumer market to make widespread adoption profitable. In their current form, AR and VR have seen a far more successful uptake rate in industrial usage and application, in part because the technology is still so pricey.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to exclude a discussion about the development of autonomous driving in this AR and VR conversation, too. The technology is instrumental in the development of fully autonomous vehicles, and while there are no full -autonomous vehicles on the road today, automakers are pushing to make them more than just vaporware.</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>Many well-established brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen already offer a suite of AR features in their top-end vehicles. Automotive suppliers like Continental, Denso, Visteon, ZF, Nvidia, Bosch, Panasonic and others are the biggest players in the AR and VR automotive space, supplying and making head-up displays (HUDs) and related components for a variety of established automakers.</p>
<p>Most of the AR features in these vehicles are focused on overlaying directional guides over camera images to help drivers navigate in unfamiliar territories or identify a particular building or landmark. Virtual reality, thus far, has been largely applied to the design, sales, demonstration and education of consumers about new technology and features in vehicles, although companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/">Audi spinoff Holoride</a> are working to offer passengers VR experiences that can help cut down on in-car motion sickness while simultaneously offering gaming, entertainment or business applications. Even ride-hailing companies are getting in on the AR and VR game, with Lyft and Uber <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qve9gq/uber-wants-to-fill-the-boredom-of-self-driving-cars-with-vr">exploring AR and VR options</a> for riders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the challenges that some would-be TikTok rivals have faced is that they often lack the same robust set of content creation tools, like filters, effects, and tools for repurposing others&#8217; content &#8212; like TikTok&#8217;s Stitch and Duet, for example. It now appears that Snapchat is working to correct that latter problem, however, as it&#8217;s been spotted working on a TikTok Duets-like feature called &#8220;Remix,&#8221; designed for replying to Snaps. This feature will allow users to create new content using their friends&#8217; Snaps &#8212; a &#8220;remix,&#8221; that is.</p>
<p>Initially, the feature will allow users to reply a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap. To do so, you can record your own Snap alongside the original as it plays &#8212; much like a TikTok Duet.</p>
<p>The feature, which Snap confirms has launched into external testing, follows Instagram&#8217;s public test of a similarly named &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature focused on Reels content. (It had also<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1281545293146750978"> tested a version for Stories</a> as a first step.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Instagram&#8217;s case, the company explains that Remix lets anyone create an Instagram Reel where your video and theirs play side-by-side. This is, essentially, Instagram&#8217;s own version of TikTok Duets, a tool that&#8217;s often used to interact with other TikTok users&#8217; content. In Duets, TikTok users can sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video; cook someone else&#8217;s recipe; record reaction videos; boost videos from lesser-known creators; and more. It&#8217;s a core part of what makes TikTok feel like a social network, rather than just a platform for more passive video viewing.</p>
<p>Last fall, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/feature-highlight-new-layouts-for-duet">TikTok announced</a> it was introducing several new layout options for Duets in addition to the left-right layout, including a new top-bottom layout, a special &#8220;react&#8221; layout, and a three-screen layout.</p>
<p>Some of those same Duet formats and others now appear to be under consideration by Snap, as well.</p>
<p>In its Remix feature, Snapchat users are presented with a screen where they can choose from a variety of options for combining Snaps &#8212; including the side-by-side and top-and-bottom formats, as well as others like where content is overlaid or where you could react to a Snap.</p>

<p>According to reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who first spotted the addition, Remix also offers a way for users to tag friends or other people they want to have permission to either remix or share their Snap via a new toggle switch.</p>

<p>It appears that users will be able to access the &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature from the same menu where you can today either report&#8221; a Snap or send it to others.</p>
<p>This menu, of course, is also available from within Snapchat&#8217;s new TikTok competitor, known as Spotlight,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/"> launched last year.</a></p>
<p>Though initially, Remix is being tested among friends, we understand that it&#8217;s expected to make its way to other parts of the Snapchat app in time. And likely, this would include Spotlight. Much like TikTok, Spotlight offers a video feed filled with short-form, entertaining videos that you can scroll through with up and down swipes, often set to popular music &#8212; thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/snapchat-to-take-on-tiktok-with-a-new-music-powered-featuring-rolling-out-this-fall/">Snap&#8217;s music industry deals</a>. This would be a natural fit for Remixes, as it&#8217;s a common way for users to interact with each others&#8217; content to create a dialog.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> @alex193a on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Snap confirmed with TechCrunch it&#8217;s beginning to test Remix on its app.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that externally we are testing the ability to reply to a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;It lets you build on your friend&#8217;s Snap while recording your own alongside the original as it plays for contextual conversations on Snapchat,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer an ETA for a broader rollout at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austin-based home lab testing kit startup <a href="https://www.everlywell.com">Everlywell</a> is expanding its scope considerably with two acquisitions, and a transformation that includes the establishment of a new parent company led by Everlywell CEO and co-founder Julia Cheek. The new entity, called Everly Health, will now offers services including at-home lab testing kits and education, population-scale testing through a U.S.-wide clinician network, telehealth and payer-supported/enterprise self-collected lab test.</p>
<p>This is a big move for Everlywell, which was found in 2015 (and which was a finalist in TechCrunch&#8217;s 2016 Disrupt SF Battlefield completion). The company has steadily iterated on its offerings, expanding its at-home testing from fertility products, to food sensitivities and allergies, and last year, to at home COVID-19 test collection.</p>
<p>Everly Health&#8217;s business now includes not only that kind of at-home consumer diagnostic and personal health education, but also many relationships through PWNHealth, which will rebrand to Everly Health Solutions, with health plans, employers and labs across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everlywell itself was actually a longtime partner of PNWHealth, which is what Cheek told me an in interview actually helped make the acquisition make so much sense to both companies. They&#8217;d been working together for years, and that collaboration had only deepened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found over the last year, was we were collaborating on all these different enterprise partnerships to offer solutions, and so our cultures are really well aligned, and our teams have worked closely together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we both share this common ethos that we felt the urgent need to help people and to save lives, but also this discipline around consumer-friendly and enabled care, grounded in diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Cheek said that the decision to go out and acquire the pieces of the puzzle needed to deliver a more comprehensive care offering was partly driven by the pandemic, but that really just drove an acceleration of what Everlywell was already beginning to see before COVID-19. Freshly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/everlywell-raises-175-million-to-expand-virtual-care-options-and-scale-its-at-home-health-testing/">capitalized with the $175 million it raised last December</a>, the startup was in a position to make some bold moves in order to make the most of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the pandemic, but especially during and looking out to post-pandemic, we have just seen this massive acceleration of the need for consumer friendly testing services,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our business has continued to grow exponentially, even since normal doctor&#8217;s appointments resumed, orders of magnitude, 300% growth. We sat back and said, since we believe healthcare is in a watershed moment post-pandemic, where do we think we need to actually be to be able to offer a full-service diagnostic solution as this entire space grows. So it&#8217;s Everlywell as a consumer friendly brand, but it&#8217;s also this massive enterprise need for home testing, and broader consumer diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new acquisitions do add some complexity to Everly Health&#8217;s business, since its Everly Health Solutions also serves a number of customers that would be considered competitive with Everlywell. Cheek points out that both businesses have a demonstrated track record of security and data integrity, compliant with HIPAA standards, and says that they&#8217;re setting up a strict firewall that will result in &#8220;complete data independence&#8221; of Everly Health Solutions to ensure there&#8217;s no possibility of anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>The companies will however share customer experience, design and product resources, however, and the plan is to build a unified brand focused on high-quality customer engagement across the board.</p>
<p>Everly Health hasn&#8217;t released the financial details of the transaction, but it has shared shared that PWNHealth CEO Sanjay Pingle will be acting in a transitional role in the combined company for the time being, and will serve on the board of Everly Health. Investors in PWNHealth, including Spectrum Equity, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield corporate VC Blue Venture Fund will also retain an ownership stake in Everly Health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design and marketing consultancy R/GA is expanding its Venture Studios program with the launch of a new <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com">Coalition Venture Studio</a> focused specifically on supporting Black-led and Black-owned startups.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by R/GA Entrepreneur in Residence Davyeon Ross, a Black entrepreneur who founded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/shottracker-raises-5m-in-seed-funding-from-magic-johnson-and-david-stern-to-bring-real-time-analytics-to-nba-teams/"> sports analytics company ShotTracker</a>. The startup (which is backed by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2021/1/shottracker-secures-$11m-financing-led-by-evertz-technologies-and-verizon-ventures/">specifically Verizon Ventures</a>) was part of R/GA&#8217;s Dodgers Accelerator, and Ross attributed much of ShotTracker&#8217;s success to connections made by the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;From that perspective, I got this firsthand view of the power of R/GA Ventures,&#8221; Ross told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To participate in the Coalition Venture Studio, startups must be majority Black-owned or have a Black CEO, CTO or board chair. However, Ross said that it won&#8217;t be using a traditional application process, and it won&#8217;t be limited to a handful of startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s going not going to be cohorts or batches of companies,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The thought process is, it’s an ongoing initiative [&#8230;] A big piece of this is, it&#8217;s not an application process, it&#8217;s a registration process. Once we work with R/GA to vet the companies, we can start positioning them for projects within the R/GA agency.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="coTW68Vo17"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/">Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/embed/#?secret=coTW68Vo17" data-secret="coTW68Vo17" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In other words, assuming a company qualifies, they&#8217;ll become eligible for three main kinds of support through the Coalition program — creative capital (consulting, design, copywriting and other services), relationship capital (introductions to what Ross described as R/GA&#8217;s &#8220;network of incredible blue chip clients) and financial capital (which could come from a syndicate led by R/GA Ventures).</p>
<p>This launch comes after last year&#8217;s protests over the killing of George Floyd led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">a broader conversation</a> about race and representation in startups and venture capital. Ross said he&#8217;s encouraged by that conversation — but at the same time, only 1% of VC money was <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-vcs-guide-to-investing-in-black-founders">deployed with Black entrepreneurs last year</a>, and there&#8217;s a risk that the industry could move on without addressing systemic issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a society, we tend to be very short term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Oh my goodness, that happened,&#8217; and then we go about our lives [&#8230;] That&#8217;s why I was excited that R/GA reached out to make this commitment. Part of this is about accountability, part of this is about easy options for folks to get involved, part of this is about storytelling. A lot of companies made statements, so this is just providing them with vehicles to be able to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, Coalition has already signed up a number of <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/partners/">partners</a>, including several from the startup and VC world like Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s TxO Initiative, Harlem Capital, Collab Capital, Ohub, Mac Venture Capital and Gingerbread Capital. R/GA&#8217;s parent company IPG is also a partner, as are the Dodgers and Elysian Park (home to Dodger Stadium).</p>
<p>Eligible startups can register <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/startups/">on the Coalition website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup from Europe is joining the race to become the first big provider of lab grown fish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a> has raised €7 million in a round of financing from investors including Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Be8, CPT Capital and Lever VC to compete with a host of startups like BluNalu, Wild Type, and Shiok Meats in a bid to market with a lab-grown fish replacement.</p>
<p>The market for sustainable fish is huge and growing. Already, concerns over the effects of overfishing and industrial fish farming are mounting as demand for fish increases. It&#8217;s the same problem that other animal-based sources of protein face. The amount of demand for high quality sources of protein from the Earth&#8217;s several billion people cannot sustainably keep up with the available supply.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why a number of cellular meat companies are focusing on fish instead of other meats like beef, pork, or chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of talent in Europe and very little companies built in this space. If you compare it t0 the mammalian space there are a lot fewer companies,&#8221; said Simon Fabich, co-founder and managing director of Bluu.  </span></p>
<p>At Berlin-based Bluu, the focus is on salmon, trout, and carp (the most popular fish in China). Other companies are tackling tuna, salmon, and shrimp, but Bluu sees carp as an especially attractive target, given its popularity in one of the world&#8217;s most populous companies.</p>
<p>One advantage for Bluu, its founders argue, is the deep experience that co-founder Sebastian Rakers has in the wild world of cultivated fish cells.</p>
<p>A marine and cell biologist who was working for several years at the Munich-based <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer Institute</a>, one of Europe&#8217;s most celebrated research institutes, Rakers led a task force that looked at potential commercial viability of cell-based meat, after conducting research on the viability of using fish cells as a component for viral production for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130292" class="wp-caption-text">Bluu Biotechnologies co-founder Sebastian Rakers. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a></p></div></p>
<p>During his research Rakers cultivated 80 different cell cultures for more than 20 different species of fish. What&#8217;s more, he was able to make these cell lines immortal.</p>
<p>Before envisioning an endless, ever-producing mass of fish cells that could overwhelm the world, it might be worth explaining what immortal cell lines mean&#8230; Actually&#8230; the endless, ever-producing mass of self-reproducing fish cells comes pretty close.</p>
<p>Most cell lines tend to die off after reprodcuing a certain number of times, which means that to manufacture meat at scale can require several biopsies of the same animal to cultivate multiple cell lines at a time. Rakers said that Bluu could avoid that step, thanks to the work that had already been done to develop these &#8220;immortal&#8221; salmon, trout, and carp cell cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s such a strong competitive advantage,&#8221; said Fabich. &#8220;If you have normal cells that are not immortalized you can only proliferate 20 to 25 times and then you need to start again from another biopsy. With immortalized cells you can grow up to 100,000 times and we can double it every day.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>With this technology in hand, Rakers said he was thinking about what could come next in his own career and met up with Gary Lin, an impact investor and the founder of <a href="https://www.purpleorange.com/">Purple Orange Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Lin connected Rakers with Fabich and the two men set off to commercialize Rakers&#8217; research as Bluu. And even though there are several companies that have a head start in the market (and in funding), Rakers said that there are certain advantages to coming in late.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago there was hardly any company looking into media development, hardly any companies focused on bioreactor technologies at a very large scale and there was no company looking for scaffolding alternatives for cell-based meat,&#8221; he said. Now there are. </span></p>
<p>The company is picking up speed quickly thanks to those other technology providers that are coming to market and will look to have a prototype product out by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The company is also pushing for regulation, which both Fabich and Rakers said were one of the last remaining obstacles to commercialization. Ultimately, the company has its eye firmly on the Asian market. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one that moves the needle,&#8221; in terms of sustainability, Fabich said. &#8220;We can have the biggest impact if we change production behavior there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York State officials struck a deal with Gov. Andrew Cuomo to allow recreational use of cannabis. The move would create the largest legal cannabis market on the East Coast, potentially creating tens of thousands of jobs and significant startups opportunities.</p>
<p>This is a big first step, though the first sale of recreational weed is unlikely to happen in 2021. The framework needs a final review, and lawmakers still need to create the rules and regulations surrounding commercial sales. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/nyregion/ny-legalize-marijuana.html">According to the New York Times</a>, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature could pass the bill as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The deal comes after several failed attempts to bring recreational cannabis to New York. Neighboring state New Jersey passed a recreational marijuana bill in the 2020 election.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The legislation, as purposed, has several interesting aspects. The purposed bill allows for weed delivery and club-like consumption lounges where patrons can consume cannabis but not alcohol. In-home growing is also allowed and limited to six plants for personal use. According to the NYT, the proposed deal funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue back to the communities where the failed war on drugs had a disproportionately negative impact. This includes reserving many business licenses for minority business owners and providing loans, grants, and incubator programs for small farmers.</p>
<p>New York lawmakers also intend to rework laws around possession by eliminating penalties for less than three ounces of cannabis. This would also expunge the record of those convicted of activities that are now legal.</p>

<p><strong>Why Founders Should Adopt OKRs Now</strong></p>
<p>Execution is key to a startup’s survival and growth — especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology products. Standing in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and employees, a founder needs to balance priorities, align teams and create a visionary product that works. Moreover, in this age of hyper feedback loops and changing business models, the founder must be agile enough to absorb and quickly react to changes in the product roadmap and consumer needs. OKRs, a toolkit used extensively by engineering and product teams, is more than relevant now for founders of all kinds to embrace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big tech is back on the virtual hill.</p>
<p>Three of tech&#8217;s most prominent CEOs will appear before the House Energy and Commerce committee today at 9AM PT as lawmakers grill the companies on their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">failure to contain disinformation and extremism</a>.</p>
<p>In opening statements <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting">made available before the hearing</a>, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai each laid out the conversation they&#8217;d prefer to have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg pushed for reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that wouldn&#8217;t resolve the issues at hand, but would probably give Facebook another leg up on smaller competitors. Google defended Section 230 and pointed to its own often mild or delayed efforts to contain election misinformation that ultimately snowballed into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter mostly looked forward rather than back, pointing to initiatives to make its own algorithms transparent and to invite more community-level moderation efforts.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/za6DHMsFHA0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The topic at hand Thursday is a big one, and there are plenty of directions lawmakers might take the hearing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">In recent months</a>, the two subcommittees leading the joint hearing have questioned Facebook about its algorithmic group recommendations — a frequent concern among extremism experts — and reports that the company served combat gear ads next to posts promoting the Capitol riot. More broadly, the committee will delve into social media&#8217;s role in disseminating dangerous misinformation, but it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll take detours through some regulatory solutions like antitrust legislation and Section 230 reform along the way.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow along, we&#8217;ve embedded the hearing above or you can check back for other coverage as we go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the trucking industry, &#8220;dwell and detention&#8221; times are the enemies of efficiency, profits and drivers. More than two billion hours are lost each year due to dwell —the time spent at a distribution yard or facility — and detention — the gap between when unloading or loading is supposed to begin and when it actually does.</p>
<p>Baton, a San Francisco-based startup developed out of 8VC&#8217;s incubator program, has developed a business that it believes will solve these long-standing problems truckers. The company&#8217;s name gives a hint at its business model. Baton is developing a network of drop zones, 24-hour facilities it has sub-leased from partners, that are located outside of busy urban centers. Long-haul truckers can pull up and leave their loaded trailers at these drop zones. Baton then partners with local fleets of Class 8 trucks that will arrive at the drop site, grab the load and then take the freight to its final destination.</p>
<p>The startup developed a software platform that coordinates vehicles, drop-zones, warehouses and local drivers through a single API. Customers also receive live automated updates via API as loads are delivered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In long-haul trucking, there&#8217;s a remarkable amount of wasted time,&#8221; co-founder Andrew Berberick said in a recent interview. Baton&#8217;s pitch is that it eliminates hours wasted with dwell and detention as well as the time spent sitting in traffic. The company says it can also help increase wages for drivers, who are typically paid by the mile and not the hour, as well as cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Baton has landed long-haul trucking firms as customers, including CRST, the private freight company that carries loads for some of the country&#8217;s largest retailers including Walmart. And it&#8217;s also attracted a variety of strategic investors. The company raised its first $3.3 million from real estate corporation Prologis and 8VC, in a seed round that closed in December 2019. Now, it&#8217;s tacking on more capital and investors in a Series A funding round, co-led by 8VC and Maersk Growth, the corporate venture arm of logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk.</p>
<p>Baton raised $10.5 million in the Series A, and now has a post-money valuation of $50 million, co-founders Nate Robert and Berberick told TechCrunch. Prologis, Ryder, Lineage Logistics, Project44 CEO Jett McCandless, KeepTruckin&#8217; CEO Shoaib Makani, Clarendon Capital operating partner John Larkin, I.S.G founder Trace Haggard, and Cooley LLC all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Baton has several drop zones in Los Angeles with plans to open more in the city. Robert and Berberick said their plan is to open zones in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Baton&#8217;s short term aim is to end waste in human-driven trucking operations. But Robert says the business model is well positioned to handle what he says will be the first viable applications of autonomous trucks. &#8220;The answer is on highways only,&#8221;Robert said. &#8220;And for that to occur you&#8217;ll have to have a nationwide network of transfer hubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baton is already piloting the idea, which Robert called &#8220;autonomous relays&#8221; with an unnamed self-driving trucks company on the Arizona-California border.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we see automated and eventually electric trucks become standard for certain routes, the network of Baton hubs and the coordination provided by its software will become seen as core infrastructure. Baton makes the transformation to automated trucking possible,&#8221; 8VC partner and co-founder Jake Medwell said.</span></p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’ve recently advised a number of emerging venture capital funds that are struggling to determine the most effective steps they can take to support their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Almost every private equity and venture capital investor now advertises that they have a platform to support their portfolio companies. The popularity of the model can be judged by the fact that the U.S.<a href="http://www.vcplatform.com/"> VC Platform</a> community has grown approximately 120% in the last three years. Similarly, its European counterpart, the <a href="https://www.euvcplatform.com/">EU VC Platform</a>, has tripled in the same period.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The ability to answer quickly and confidently when your business model is having holes poked in it during diligence is really powerful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, most of us don’t have the budget of an Andreessen Horowitz to support almost every major need of emerging companies. You could spend an unlimited budget on all possible company-building <a href="https://teten.com/pa">resources</a>. “You can’t pick a platform strategy that’s unique, but you can pick a platform strategy that your firm can uniquely execute,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/rre-ventures-fund-vii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">noted</a> Maria Palma of REE Ventures.</p>
<p>I propose here a framework for prioritizing your platform buildout. Once you have assembled the right core team, I recommend prioritizing as follows:</p>
<p><b>First, meet with your portfolio company management. </b>As an agenda for each meeting, I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we most add value, in addition to helping with financing? (This is an open-ended query and the most important question.)</li>
<li>What are your fundraising goals?</li>
<li>What is the profile of people whom you are most interested in meeting?</li>
<li>From which service providers have you received the most value?</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://docsend.com/view/w54w8ry">presentation </a>at the 4th Annual VC Platform Summit, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbkim">Nick Kim</a>, Crosscut Ventures’ head of platform, shared their platform development methodology, which he viewed as an exercise in product development.</p>
<p>“Firms should match services to the stage-specific needs of companies,” Dan Kozikowski, partner and head of platform for <a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/">FirstMark Capital</a>, told me. “For example, recruiting writ large is useful at all stages of development. But things like vendor introductions are only needle-movers at the earliest stages. Similarly, customer introductions are invaluable in the early days, but become less valuable once a company has a fully formed go-to-market function.”</p>
<p>Then, pluck the low-hanging fruit: easy, low-cost and highly scalable infrastructure. This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relationships with relevant service providers</b> in your vertical, often with pre-negotiated discounts: coaches, lawyers, accountants, common software vendors, consultants. Generally, I suggest exploring <a href="https://builtfirst.com/">BuiltFirst</a>, <a href="https://clutch.co/">Clutch</a>, <a href="http://fundedbuy.com/">FundedBuy</a>, <a href="https://rocketplace.com/">Rocketplace</a> and/or <a href="https://spotsource.com/">SpotSource.</a> For negotiation with providers, consider <a href="https://www.buyer.co/">Buyer</a>. Alpaca VC shares their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vHQjLd0s3qJ-PX9yONOdszuOYrhHhtvrHDu0tz0nDVU/edit#gid=194978991">Master Agency List</a>.</li>
<li><b>A well-organized library of best practices </b>for founders in your vertical, which you can share as appropriate. <a href="https://search.firstround.com/">First Search</a>, <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/library">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://www.gsvlabs.com/passport">OneValley Passport</a> are examples of comprehensive founder resources from investors. <a href="http://askanything.vc/">Ask Anything</a> aggregates resources from all the VCs. I have developed a <a href="https://teten.com/ceo">founder curriculum</a> on my blog.</li>
<li><b>Relationships with venture partners, entrepreneurs in residence</b> and other nonsalaried personnel who can help your companies. Explore a <a href="https://teten.com/speaker/operating-executives/">roadmap</a> of your options in working with outside talent.</li>
<li><b>Organize </b><a href="https://teten.com/blog/category/industry/conferences/"><b>events</b></a><b> in your vertical</b>. Particularly when events are all virtual, this is an easy and low-cost way to build trusted relationships with the leaders in your space.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend building a strong internal tech stack to handle the deluge of requests for help you’ll get from companies as you scale. “The biggest investment of resources with our tech platform relates to the capturing and maintenance of data on our huge portfolio of 1,100-plus evolving tech companies,” Jeff Pomeranz, partner at <a href="http://rightsidecapital.com/">Right Side Capital</a>, said.</p>
<p>“For instance, tracking ‘months of runway’ combined with the month-over-month change to that metric allows us to rapidly identify companies that may be distressed. Adding full lifecycle data and industry exposure tags to that, across such a large number of companies, often enables us to see trends ahead of the market, such as retail decimation a few years ago.” Investigate ways to use<a href="http://teten.com/pevctech"> technology and analytics to make better investments</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond these steps, I suggest you apply a two-part test:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes after a messy 2020 for Holberton, and not only because the pandemic put a stop to in-person learning.</p>
<p>The original promise of Holberton was that it provided students &#8212; which it selects through a blind admissions process &#8212; with a well-rounded software development education akin to a college education for free. In return, students provide a set amount of their salary for the next few years to the school as part of a deferred tuition agreement, up to a maximum of $85,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But early last year, California&#8217;s Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holberton_emergency_20200124.pdf">directed the school</a> to immediately cease operation, in part because the agency <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holbertonschool_1stamendacc.pdf">found</a> that Holberton had started offering a new, unapproved program. This program, a nine-month training program augmented by six months of employment, required students to pay the full $85,000 cost of its approved programs. After a hearing, the BPPE allowed Holberton to continue to operate its other programs. A number of students also <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/san-francisco-based-holberton-coding-school-facing-fraud-accusations-from-former-students/">accused the school</a> of not giving them the education it had promised.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Holberton continued expanding, though. It opened campuses in Mexico and Peru, for example. Indeed, it doubled the number of schools in its system from nine to 18 in 2020.</p>
<p>But on December 17, 2020, Holberton voluntarily surrendered its operating license in California. The day before, Holberton <a href="https://blog.holbertonschool.com/the-future-of-holberton/#payment-comparison-table-SF">announced</a> that it would not re-open its campus in San Francisco, which had been shut down since March because of the pandemic. Holberton co-founder Sylvain Kalache argued that the school would be best positioned to achieve its mission by &#8220;working with amazing local partners who operate the campuses and deeply understand their markets’ unique needs&#8221; and not by operating its own campuses.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech valuations aren&#8217;t skyrocketing, but investors see more exit opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/embed/#?secret=2FtVlPIK2H" data-secret="2FtVlPIK2H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It now thinks of itself more as an &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; that offers franchised campuses and education tools.</p>
<p>In January, California&#8217;s attorney general struck down the fraud allegations against the school. &#8220;California was the only market in which Holberton faced any regulatory challenges,&#8221; Kalache wrote in the company&#8217;s first public acknowledgment of the lawsuits. &#8220;With this now behind us, we are excited to move forward with our original mission of providing affordable and accessible education to prospective software engineers around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, that&#8217;s how Holberton&#8217;s funders feel about this, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They’ve proven successful in breaking down barriers of cost and access while delivering a world-class curriculum,&#8221; said Manoel Lemos, managing partner at Redpoint eventures. &#8220;With the concept of ‘OS of Education’ as a service, they provide customers with all the tools they need for success. Customers can be nonprofit impact investors who want to improve local economies, education institutions who want to fill gaps in how they teach in a post-COVID learning environment, or corporations who want to provide the best training possible as education providers themselves or as employee development programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holberton founder and CEO Julien Barbier tells me that, today, &#8220;for the first time since our creation, we have started working with universities to help them create a better experience and add hands-on education on top of their traditional methodology. Everyone’s happy: the school, the students, and the teachers &#8212; because they prefer to focus on teaching and not spend huge amounts of time correcting projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expects to see 5,000 students join this year, up from 500 in 2019, and see the network expand with new schools in the U.S., Europe, LatAm and Africa. He also noted that the company already has customers for its &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; tools for auto-grading projects and its online programs. Just this week, Holberton Tulsa announced plans to more than double its physical campus in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raising funds is helping us support and accelerate our vision of creating this &#8216;OS of education.&#8217; Many educational entities need help and tools to better support their students and their staff. It is now that they need our help. Again, COVID has accelerated the digital transformation, and clearly, there are a lot of gaps that need to be filled,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] We are now a SaaS company which charges other businesses, universities or non-profits to use our tools and/or contents so that they can run their education/training programs at scale, with a better experience, while increasing the quality of education.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ryu.games/">Ryu Games</a>, a startup that helps developers add cash tournaments to their mobile games, announced this morning it has raised $2.3 million in a seed round. The funds came from a number of investors, including <a href="https://sidedoorventures.co/">Side Door Ventures</a>, <a href="https://mgvcapitalgroup.com/">MGV Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.velopartners.co.uk/">Velo Partners</a> and <a href="https://cittacapital.com/">Citta Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a> participated in the round. To see the accelerator take part in the funding round is not a surprise, as TechCrunch first caught wind of Ryu during its participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/">the most recent 500 Startups demo day</a>. At the time, we were enthused by the idea of gamers wagering money to go head-to-head with other players on mobile devices. Investors appear to back our first impression of the company.</p>
<p>The gist behind our bullishness on the company&#8217;s idea is that esports is cool. And though your humble servant is sufficiently ancient as to favor PC-based esports, younger folks are into mobile gaming esports. Fair enough. Now mix in the sports-betting frenzy that we&#8217;ve seen in the United States, and you have a potentially potent cocktail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fantasy startup Esports One raises $4M more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/esports-one-funding/embed/#?secret=eV3YIjdxyH" data-secret="eV3YIjdxyH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Ryu Games co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosskrasner/">Ross Krasner</a> to dig in a bit more. It turns out that the original esports-y model that we envisioned for Ryu was a bit off. Instead, players will often go toe-to-toe in an asynchronous fashion, betting high scores in a game against one another. So, competitive &#8220;StarCraft II&#8221; this is not. But &#8220;StarCraft&#8221; is famously difficult to be even mediocre at, while mobile games are simpler by nature, and thus more popular.</p>
<p>Perhaps your parents will square off against office friends in cash-fueled solitaire tournaments.</p>
<p>The money setup is simple, with Krasner likening it to a poker tournament. You wager a set amount, and then play. Ryu collects a fee for hosting, and then players get to it.</p>
<p>Ryu hopes to be present on a few dozen games this year. One matter that could slow adoption, however, is that games it partners with tend to relaunch a version of their title with Ryu&#8217;s SDK built in. The startup bites back against the work that partner-developers have to undertake by cross-promoting titles that use its system. So, if you sign up, you can do more than generate revenue. Your game might also find a new audience.</p>
<p>Like with most seed-stage startups, Ryu Games is more of a bet on the future than proof of a new trend. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with this set of capital, especially as vaccines take larger and larger bites out of the pandemic that has kept us locked up for so very long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online branded payments now run the gamut of anything from Spotify vouchers, Netflix vouchers, Neosurf, PaySafe cards, and everything in between. Consumers use them to pay for a variety of things. In Europe, they are an increasingly big business. Now, European branded payments fintech <a href="https://Recharge.com">Recharge.com</a> has raised €10m ($11.8m) in a debt funding round led by London-based <a href="http://www.kreoscapital.com/">Kreos Capital</a>, a growth debt provider for high-growth companies. In 2019 the Dutch startup (formerly Creative Group) took <a href="https://company.recharge.com/creative-group-raises-22-million-from-prime-venture">investment</a> of €22m from Prime Ventures.</p>
<p>In 2019 the Dutch fintech Creative Group, which owns the Recharge.com and Rapido.com brands, <a href="https://company.recharge.com/creative-group-raises-22-million-from-prime-venture">took investment of €22m from Prime Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Recharge has also appointed Michael Kent &#8211; who previously founded payments companies Small World and Azimo, along with UK neobank Tandem &#8211; as its non-executive chairman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recharge.com says it plans to use the funding to extend its mobile offering, product range, and expand in regions such as North America, Latin America and the GCC. It’s also aiming for sales of €450m in 2021.</p>
<p>Günther Vogelpoel CEO of Recharge.com said in a statement: “We live in a world of instant wish fulfillment, from taxis that appear on demand to same-day delivery of consumer goods. Recharge.com gives customers a fast, safe and simple way to fulfill their wishes, whether that’s an essential remittance or access to digital goods and services.”</p>
<p>Commenting, Kent said: “The era of supermarket gift cards and mobile top-ups is drawing to a close. Branded payments have exploded during the global lockdown as consumers seek digital alternatives to the high street. People are now aware that online branded payments are safe, fast, and convenient.”</p>
<p>Through a range of digital vouchers from brands including Apple, Google, Spotify, Xbox and PlayStation as well as cross-border remittances of call, data credits etc Recharge is attacking the market from the consumer angle.</p>
<p>The biggest company in this space is Blackhawk networks which is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackhawk-ntwrk-m-a-silverlake-idUSKBN1F51LU">owned by private equity group Silverlake</a>. It’s considered a large player in Europe which has a direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>As Kent told me over a Zoom call: “Nobody actually owns the consumer side of this business globally so that&#8217;s the big opportunity.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let's talk about it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What happens to hot fintech startups that have benefited from a rise in consumer trading activity if regular folks lose interest in financial wagers?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the question facing Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms that have ridden an upward cycle. Each has performed well in recent quarters: Robinhood by securing huge payment-for-order-flow revenues, while Coinbase&#8217;s trading fees have proven incredibly lucrative, something we learned when it filed to go public.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>According to recent reporting, the consumer trading frenzy could be slowing: Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/retail-trader-army-appears-to-retreat-with-latest-stimulus-wave?sref=lSuy1ocu">recently noted that options trading</a> volume is slipping, Robinhood&#8217;s app store ranking is falling, and some alternative assets are also losing steam. Other <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1374675578771681285">reporting from the publication</a> notes that many SPAC shares are underwater while Google trends data indicates falling consumer trading interest, perhaps limiting the inflow of new users for equities-focused apps.</p>
<p>There are other indications that the red-hot speculative consumer market is cooling. Bitcoin is off around 10% in the last week after a blistering rise in recent quarters. Hot stocks like Peloton, once a darling of traders, fell more than 10% yesterday alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But looking past price declines and other signals of market chop, <em>volume</em> itself at some well-known exchanges could be falling.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a historical precedent for such declines. Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenues, to pick an example, have proved variable based on consumer interest in cryptocurrencies, with the company benefiting from rising demand and trading activity and seeing its top line decline in periods of restrained enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Robinhood and its fellow free trading apps have yet to undergo a similar rise-and-fall in trading volume, I&#8217;d reckon. At least of the sort of extreme up-and-down that Coinbase endured after the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom. Our question is, what would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenue declines, and the Robinhood example</h2>
<p>Coinbase was a famously lucrative organization during the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can see from the following chart from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a> that the company&#8217;s m<em>onthly transacting users (</em>MTUs) dropped sharply into 2018. The percentage decline from 2.7 million to 800,000 is just over 70%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130160" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130160" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2130160 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?w=602" alt="" width="602" height="372" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coinbase</p></div></p>
<p>And in case you think we&#8217;re being rude, we have a related chart from the same SEC filing that shows trading volume falling over the same period, not merely MTUs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gorillasapp.com/">Gorillas</a>, the Berlin-HQ&#8217;d startup that promises to let you order groceries and other &#8220;every day&#8221; items for delivery in as little as ten minutes, has raised $290 million in Series B funding, at a valuation that surpasses $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round &#8212; which was first <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tencent-dst-coatue-grocery-startup-gorillas-unicorn-funding-round-2021-3?r=US&#038;IR=T">reported</a> by BI &#8212; is led by Coatue Management, DST Global, and Tencent,  with participation from Green Oaks, Fifth Wall, and Dragoneer. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Previous backer</a> Atlantic Food Labs also followed on.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Gorillas CEO and co-founder Kağan Sümer tells TechCrunch the round is &#8220;100% equity&#8221; (i.e. without a debt component). Asked if it includes any secondary funding &#8212; seeing existing shareholders liquidate a portion of their shares &#8212; Gorillas declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having become one of the fastest European startups to have achieved so-called &#8220;unicorn&#8221; status &#8212; a valuation of $1 billion or more &#8212; Gorillas says it will reward its rider crew and warehouse staff with $1 million in bonuses. However, the company isn&#8217;t disclosing how this one-off bonus breaks down per worker, and it isn&#8217;t clear if the bonus is cash or stock or a mixture of both. The move comes at a time when Gorillas riders in Germany <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/food/gorillas-tencent-unicorn/">are reportedly organising to unionise</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast to established gig economy models, we employ more than a thousand riders directly,&#8221; says Sümer. &#8220;Therefore, we invest in a strong career development program, rider security and a healthy working environment. Beyond that, all riders will receive a once-off payment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Founded last May by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in Berlin, Gorillas has already expanded to more than 12 cities, including Amsterdam, London and Munich. The company lets you order groceries and other household items on-demand with average delivery time of ten minutes.</p>
<p>To do this, it operates a vertical or &#8220;dark store&#8221; model, seeing it set up its own micro fulfillment centers, which currently total 40, spread across Germany, U.K., and the Netherlands. Customers are charged just over $2 per delivery and can order from &#8220;more than 2,000 essential items at retail prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the weekly grocery run is outdated because people’s lives are increasingly spontaneous and shopping habits change accordingly,&#8221; says Sümer, noting that while access to supermarkets has increased, the space we have to store goods has decreased as people in cities are living in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, this pandemic has accelerated the need for grocery deliveries. If we can order clothes and trinkets and have them delivered to our door, the same should be said for our essential needs. Gorillas helps customers get what they need when they need it, whether this is their weekly grocery list or the tomatoes they forgot for tonight’s pasta recipe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sümer says that the service initially attracted typical early adopters because it was a radically new experience and the app was only available in English. He claims that Gorillas has since gained a &#8220;very broad&#8221; base of users that are &#8220;extremely loyal&#8221;. &#8220;With geographical expansion and the rapid increase of word-of-mouth, we now cater to pretty much anyone you’d meet in a supermarket,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asked to share what a typical basket looks like, and therefore what kind of existing grocery habits Gorillas is displacing, Sümer says that users increase their basket size over time as they gain trust in the service and its products. &#8220;Simultaneously, customers are integrating an increasing share of their typical supermarket purchases within their Gorillas orders. This includes fresh goods like fruit and vegetables, as well as products of local suppliers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dark store competition in cities like London &#8212; where Gorillas recently expanded and counts as a key market &#8212; continues to ramp up.

<p>Earlier this month, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The curbside is being squeezed as the number of commercial vehicle operators and gig economy workers battle over this increasingly scarce real estate — a problem that has been compounded by an uptick in on-demand delivery services fueled by the pandemic.</p>
<p>A number of startups such as Coord and curbflow have popped up in recent years, all aiming to solve this supply and demand problem. One entrant, the three-year-old startup <a href="https://www.automotus.co/">Automotus</a>, is beginning to rack up deployments in zones within cities like Santa Monica, Pittsburgh, Bellevue, Washington and Turin, Italy. A project in Los Angeles is also in the works.</p>
<p>Investors have taken notice as well. The company, which developed video analytics technology to monitor and manage curbsides for cities, said in February it had raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Quake Capital, Techstars Ventures, Kevin Uhlenhaker (the co-founder &amp; CEO at NuPark, which was acquired by Passport) and Baron Davis. CEO Jordan Justus told TechCrunch the company&#8217;s total raise is now $2.3 million. New investors include Ben Bear, Derrick Ko, and Zaizhuang Cheng of micromobility company Spin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is still small, with just 11 full-time employees. However, Justus said the newly raised funds are being used to expand into new markets and to hire more employees.</p>
<p>Automotus uses computer vision technology to capture video of parking zones — places that might be designated for only zero-emissions vehicles or commercial deliveries. Their software handles a variety of functions, including analysis and enforcement. Cities are able to access analytics through a web app. Commercial fleets are able to access information about parking zones via open APIs and in some cases a mobile app, according to Justus.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129930" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129930" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2129930 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png" alt="Automotus Dashboard" width="2000" height="1545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=1536,1187 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2129930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Automotus</p></div></p>
<p>For instance, one newly announced pilot project with Santa Monica and Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator will monitor a one-square-mile zero-emissions delivery zone in the city. Automotus will provide anonymized data for evaluating the zone’s impacts on delivery efficiency, safety, congestion and emissions, and will make real-time parking availability data available to all zero-emissions delivery zone drivers.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in late 2017 and is a Techstars alum, makes its money primarily through revenue sharing on its enforcement feature. Automotus gets a slice of the payment commercial customers are automatically charged when parking in specific zones, as well as transaction fees on parking violations. While the analytics might help cities set policy or designate pick-up and drop-off zones, it&#8217;s the enforcement feature that Justus says offers the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles used Automotus&#8217; tech to fully automate parking enforcement. Automotus said enforcement efficiency and revenue increased by more than 500%, and added that implementing these measures led to a 24% increase in parking turnover and a 20% reduction in traffic.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;The enforcement component is really critical to the fleet operators because they need to know that these zones are managed efficiently and managed well so that they&#8217;re available for commercial use, if that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re intended for,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.coscreen.co/">CoScreen</a>, a startup that helps teams share screens and collaborate in real-time, formally launched its product to market. It also disclosed that it has raised $4.6 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a> led its Seed round. <a href="https://twitter.com/tillpieper">Till Pieper</a>, CoScreen&#8217;s co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch in an interview that it raised the bulk of its capital pre-pandemic, with the rest coming during 2020 in smaller chunks. A number of angels took part in funding the company, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcwarner/">GitHub CTO Jason Warner</a>.</p>
<p>Why is screen-sharing worth millions in funding, and the time and attention of a whole team? It&#8217;s a good question. Happily the CoScreen team have built something that&#8217;s could prove more than a bit better than what you currently use in Zoom to share puppy pics with your team during meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s CoScreen?</h2>
<p>CoScreen provides screen-sharing capabilities, but in a neat manner. Let&#8217;s say you are on a Mac at your house, and I&#8217;m on a PC at mine. And we need to collab and share some work. I have a document you need to help me edit, and you have an image you want me to view. Using CoScreen, with one click according to Pieper, we can share the two apps across the Internet. Yours will appear on my screen as it was native, and vice versa, and we can both interact with them in real-time.</p>
<p>Or as close to real-time as possible; Pieper told TechCrunch that latency is something that CoScreen will work on forever. Which makes sense, but what the company has built it thinks is good enough to take to market. So, today it&#8217;s launching the service after a period of time in beta for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>CoScreen also has audio and video-chatting capabilities. With limits. You can&#8217;t make video windows too big, for example, helping to keep the mental-load of chatting low. As someone with regular Zoom poisoning, that makes sense.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s project hits me as one of those things that sounds easy but isn&#8217;t. Remember Google Wave? It allowed for instantaneous co-writing. It was amazing. It died. And its successor-of-sorts Google Docs is a laggy mess to this day that feels more quarter-baked than half-done. Real-time tech is not simple.</p>
<p>Is the market too full of apps that allow a version of what CoScreen does for the startup to succeed? Maybe, maybe not. Zoom stormed the already-mature video chat market with a product that <em>actually worked</em>. And so software that I have used has been very good at screen-sharing, let alone sharing <em>and</em> collaborating. So if CoScreen&#8217;s tech is good, the company should have a shot at broad adoption.</p>
<p>Which it is banking on. The startup is currently offering its product for free for a few weeks. It will focus on monetization later, Pieper explained. Making money is just not a burning desire for the firm at the moment, which implies both confidence in its product and bank account.</p>
<p>Closing, the startup is targeting engineers and other agile teams, though I suspect that its product will have wider market remit in time.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we&#8217;ll have to wait for numbers to see what&#8217;s ahead for CoScreen. The company didn&#8217;t share much in the way of usage metrics, which was reasonable given its recent beta status. We&#8217;ll expect more hard figures the next time we chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skycatch today announced a $25 million raise, led by <a href="https://ventures.adb.org/">ADB Ventures</a> and Wavemaker. Founded in 2013, the Bay Area-based company provides centimeter-accurate 3D scanning services, primarily for construction sites and mining operations.</p>
<p>The service has already been rolled out in a number of different locations around the world &#8212; with north of 10,000 sites, according to founder and CEO Christian Sanz. The list includes Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Australia, Canada, the U.S., Indonesia, China, Philippines, Thailand and Japan. In particular, the company is seeking to work with sites where connectivity is limited.</p>
<p>“The process of generating high-precision, centimeter-accurate data is extremely difficult. It typically is owned by the laser scanning market,” says Sanz. “Drones, in general, out of the box are not able to achieve that. We saw the true value prop for Skycatch is operating in edge environments where there’s no connection to internet. That’s where we saw the most demand, initially. That is typically mining companies, operating in all of these remote regions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s technology works with off-the-shelf drones, including ones manufactured by DJI. It provides the 3D mapping software, as well as a base station with an edge processor, known as the Edge 1. Skycatch is also working with off-the-shelf lidar companies to help capture data in more difficult environments, including underground for mining operations.</p>
