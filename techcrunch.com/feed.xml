<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes after a messy 2020 for Holberton, and not only because the pandemic put a stop to in-person learning.</p>
<p>The original promise of Holberton was that it provided students &#8212; which it selects through a blind admissions process &#8212; with a well-rounded software development education akin to a college education for free. In return, students provide a set amount of their salary for the next few years to the school as part of a deferred tuition agreement, up to a maximum of $85,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But early last year, California&#8217;s Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holberton_emergency_20200124.pdf">directed the school</a> to immediately cease operation, in part because the agency <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holbertonschool_1stamendacc.pdf">found</a> that Holberton had started offering a new, unapproved program. This program, a nine-month training program augmented by six months of employment, required students to pay the full $85,000 cost of its approved programs. After a hearing, the BPPE allowed Holberton to continue to operate its other programs. A number of students also <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/san-francisco-based-holberton-coding-school-facing-fraud-accusations-from-former-students/">accused the school</a> of not giving them the education it had promised.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Holberton continued expanding, though. It opened campuses in Mexico and Peru, for example. Indeed, it doubled the number of schools in its system from nine to 18 in 2020.</p>
<p>But on December 17, 2020, Holberton voluntarily surrendered its operating license in California. The day before, Holberton <a href="https://blog.holbertonschool.com/the-future-of-holberton/#payment-comparison-table-SF">announced</a> that it would not re-open its campus in San Francisco, which had been shut down since March because of the pandemic. Holberton co-founder Sylvain Kalache argued that the school would be best positioned to achieve its mission by &#8220;working with amazing local partners who operate the campuses and deeply understand their markets’ unique needs&#8221; and not by operating its own campuses.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech valuations aren&#8217;t skyrocketing, but investors see more exit opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/embed/#?secret=2FtVlPIK2H" data-secret="2FtVlPIK2H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It now thinks of itself more as an &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; that offers franchised campuses and education tools.</p>
<p>In January, California&#8217;s attorney general struck down the fraud allegations against the school. &#8220;California was the only market in which Holberton faced any regulatory challenges,&#8221; Kalache wrote in the company&#8217;s first public acknowledgment of the lawsuits. &#8220;With this now behind us, we are excited to move forward with our original mission of providing affordable and accessible education to prospective software engineers around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, that&#8217;s how Holberton&#8217;s funders feel about this, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They’ve proven successful in breaking down barriers of cost and access while delivering a world-class curriculum,&#8221; said Manoel Lemos, managing partner at Redpoint eventures. &#8220;With the concept of ‘OS of Education’ as a service, they provide customers with all the tools they need for success. Customers can be nonprofit impact investors who want to improve local economies, education institutions who want to fill gaps in how they teach in a post-COVID learning environment, or corporations who want to provide the best training possible as education providers themselves or as employee development programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holberton founder and CEO Julien Barbier tells me that, today, &#8220;for the first time since our creation, we have started working with universities to help them create a better experience and add hands-on education on top of their traditional methodology. Everyone’s happy: the school, the students, and the teachers &#8212; because they prefer to focus on teaching and not spend huge amounts of time correcting projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expects to see 5,000 students join this year, up from 500 in 2019, and see the network expand with new schools in the U.S., Europe, LatAm and Africa. He also noted that the company already has customers for its &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; tools for auto-grading projects and its online programs. Just this week, Holberton Tulsa announced plans to more than double its physical campus in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raising funds is helping us support and accelerate our vision of creating this &#8216;OS of education.&#8217; Many educational entities need help and tools to better support their students and their staff. It is now that they need our help. Again, COVID has accelerated the digital transformation, and clearly, there are a lot of gaps that need to be filled,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] We are now a SaaS company which charges other businesses, universities or non-profits to use our tools and/or contents so that they can run their education/training programs at scale, with a better experience, while increasing the quality of education.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ryu.games/">Ryu Games</a>, a startup that helps developers add cash tournaments to their mobile games, announced this morning it has raised $2.3 million in a seed round. The funds came from a number of investors, including <a href="https://sidedoorventures.co/">Side Door Ventures</a>, <a href="https://mgvcapitalgroup.com/">MGV Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.velopartners.co.uk/">Velo Partners</a> and <a href="https://cittacapital.com/">Citta Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a> participated in the round. To see the accelerator take part in the funding round is not a surprise, as TechCrunch first caught wind of Ryu during its participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/">the most recent 500 Startups demo day</a>. At the time, we were enthused by the idea of gamers wagering money to go head-to-head with other players on mobile devices. Investors appear to back our first impression of the company.</p>
<p>The gist behind our bullishness on the company&#8217;s idea is that esports is cool. And though your humble servant is sufficiently ancient as to favor PC-based esports, younger folks are into mobile gaming esports. Fair enough. Now mix in the sports-betting frenzy that we&#8217;ve seen in the United States, and you have a potentially potent cocktail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fantasy startup Esports One raises $4M more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/esports-one-funding/embed/#?secret=eV3YIjdxyH" data-secret="eV3YIjdxyH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Ryu Games co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosskrasner/">Ross Krasner</a> to dig in a bit more. It turns out that the original esports-y model that we envisioned for Ryu was a bit off. Instead, players will often go toe-to-toe in an asynchronous fashion, betting high scores in a game against one another. So, competitive &#8220;StarCraft II&#8221; this is not. But &#8220;StarCraft&#8221; is famously difficult to be even mediocre at, while mobile games are simpler by nature, and thus more popular.</p>
<p>Perhaps your parents will square off against office friends in cash-fueled solitaire tournaments.</p>
<p>The money setup is simple, with Krasner likening it to a poker tournament. You wager a set amount, and then play. Ryu collects a fee for hosting, and then players get to it.</p>
<p>Ryu hopes to be present on a few dozen games this year. One matter that could slow adoption, however, is that games it partners with tend to relaunch a version of their title with Ryu&#8217;s SDK built in. The startup bites back against the work that partner-developers have to undertake by cross-promoting titles that use its system. So, if you sign up, you can do more than generate revenue. Your game might also find a new audience.</p>
<p>Like with most seed-stage startups, Ryu Games is more of a bet on the future than proof of a new trend. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with this set of capital, especially as vaccines take larger and larger bites out of the pandemic that has kept us locked up for so very long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online branded payments now run the gamut of anything from Spotify vouchers, Netflix vouchers, Neosurf, PaySafe cards, and everything in between. Consumers use them to pay for a variety of things. In Europe, they are an increasingly big business. Now, European branded payments company <a href="https://Recharge.com">Recharge.com</a> has raised €10m ($11.8m) in a debt funding round led by London-based <a href="http://www.kreoscapital.com/">Kreos Capital</a>, a growth debt provider for high-growth companies. In 2019 the Dutch fintech Creative Group, which owns the Recharge.com and Rapido.com brands, <a href="https://company.recharge.com/creative-group-raises-22-million-from-prime-venture">took investment of €22m from Prime Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Recharge has also appointed Michael Kent &#8211; who previously founded payments companies Small World and Azimo, along with UK neobank Tandem &#8211; as its non-executive chairman.</p>
<p>Recharge.com says it plans to use the funding to extend its mobile offering, product range, and expand in regions such as North America, Latin America and the GCC. It’s also aiming for sales of €450m in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Günther Vogelpoel CEO of Recharge.com said in a statement: “We live in a world of instant wish fulfillment, from taxis that appear on demand to same-day delivery of consumer goods. Recharge.com gives customers a fast, safe and simple way to fulfill their wishes, whether that’s an essential remittance or access to digital goods and services.”</p>
<p>Commenting, Kent said: “The era of supermarket gift cards and mobile top-ups is drawing to a close. Branded payments have exploded during the global lockdown as consumers seek digital alternatives to the high street. People are now aware that online branded payments are safe, fast, and convenient.”</p>
<p>Through a range of digital vouchers from brands including Apple, Google, Spotify, Xbox and PlayStation as well as cross-border remittances of call, data credits etc Recharge is attacking the market from the consumer angle.</p>
<p>The biggest company in this space is Blackhawk networks which is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackhawk-ntwrk-m-a-silverlake-idUSKBN1F51LU">owned by private equity group Silverlake</a>. It’s considered a large player in Europe which has a direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>As Kent told me over a Zoom call: “Nobody actually owns the consumer side of this business globally so that&#8217;s the big opportunity.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let's talk about it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What happens to hot fintech startups that have benefited from a rise in consumer trading activity if regular folks lose interest in financial wagers?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the question facing Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms that have ridden an upward cycle. Each has performed well in recent quarters: Robinhood by securing huge payment-for-order-flow revenues, while Coinbase&#8217;s trading fees have proven incredibly lucrative, something we learned when it filed to go public.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>According to recent reporting, the consumer trading frenzy could be slowing: Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/retail-trader-army-appears-to-retreat-with-latest-stimulus-wave?sref=lSuy1ocu">recently noted that options trading</a> volume is slipping, Robinhood&#8217;s app store ranking is falling, and some alternative assets are also losing steam. Other <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1374675578771681285">reporting from the publication</a> notes that many SPAC shares are underwater while Google trends data indicates falling consumer trading interest, perhaps limiting the inflow of new users for equities-focused apps.</p>
<p>There are other indications that the red-hot speculative consumer market is cooling. Bitcoin is off around 10% in the last week after a blistering rise in recent quarters. Hot stocks like Peloton, once a darling of traders, fell more than 10% yesterday alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But looking past price declines and other signals of market chop, <em>volume</em> itself at some well-known exchanges could be falling.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a historical precedent for such declines. Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenues, to pick an example, have proved variable based on consumer interest in cryptocurrencies, with the company benefiting from rising demand and trading activity and seeing its top line decline in periods of restrained enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Robinhood and its fellow free-trading apps have yet to undergo a similar rise-and-fall in trading volume, I&#8217;d reckon. At least of the sort of extreme up-and-down that Coinbase endured after the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom. Our question is, what would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenue declines, and the Robinhood example</h2>
<p>Coinbase was a famously lucrative organization during the 2017/-2018 bitcoin boom.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can see from the following chart from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a> that the company&#8217;s <em>Monthly Transacting Users (</em>MTUs) dropped sharply into 2018. The percentage decline from 2.7 million to 800,000 is just over 70%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2130160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?w=602" alt="" width="602" height="372" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>And in case you think we&#8217;re being rude, we have a related chart from the same SEC filing that shows trading volume falling over the same period, not merely MTUs. We&#8217;re not picking a loose proxy to merely infer that trading revenue dipped at Coinbase. We can show it:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gorillasapp.com/">Gorillas</a>, the Berlin-HQ&#8217;d startup that promises to let you order groceries and other &#8220;every day&#8221; items for delivery in as little as ten minutes, has raised $290 million in Series B funding, at a valuation that surpasses $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round &#8212; which was first <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tencent-dst-coatue-grocery-startup-gorillas-unicorn-funding-round-2021-3?r=US&#038;IR=T">reported</a> by BI &#8212; is led by Coatue Management, DST Global, and Tencent,  with participation from Green Oaks, and Dragoneer. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Previous backer</a> Atlantic Food Labs also followed on.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Gorillas CEO and co-founder Kağan Sümer tells TechCrunch the round is &#8220;100% equity&#8221; (i.e. without a debt component). Asked if it includes any secondary funding &#8212; seeing existing shareholders liquidate a portion of their shares &#8212; Gorillas declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having become one of the fastest European startups to have achieved so-called &#8220;unicorn&#8221; status &#8212; a valuation of $1 billion or more &#8212; Gorillas says it will reward its rider crew and warehouse staff with $1 million in bonuses. However, the company isn&#8217;t disclosing how this one-off bonus breaks down per worker, and it isn&#8217;t clear if the bonus is cash or stock or a mixture of both. The move comes at a time when Gorillas riders in Germany <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/food/gorillas-tencent-unicorn/">are reportedly organising to unionise</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast to established gig economy models, we employ more than a thousand riders directly,&#8221; says Sümer. &#8220;Therefore, we invest in a strong career development program, rider security and a healthy working environment. Beyond that, all riders will receive a once-off payment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Founded last May by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in Berlin, Gorillas has already expanded to more than 12 cities, including Amsterdam, London and Munich. The company lets you order groceries and other household items on-demand with average delivery time of ten minutes.</p>
<p>To do this, it operates a vertical or &#8220;dark store&#8221; model, seeing it set up its own micro fulfillment centers, which currently total 40, spread across Germany, U.K., and the Netherlands. Customers are charged just over $2 per delivery and can order from &#8220;more than 2,000 essential items at retail prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the weekly grocery run is outdated because people’s lives are increasingly spontaneous and shopping habits change accordingly,&#8221; says Sümer, noting that while access to supermarkets has increased, the space we have to store goods has decreased as people in cities are living in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, this pandemic has accelerated the need for grocery deliveries. If we can order clothes and trinkets and have them delivered to our door, the same should be said for our essential needs. Gorillas helps customers get what they need when they need it, whether this is their weekly grocery list or the tomatoes they forgot for tonight’s pasta recipe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sümer says that the service initially attracted typical early adopters because it was a radically new experience and the app was only available in English. He claims that Gorillas has since gained a &#8220;very broad&#8221; base of users that are &#8220;extremely loyal&#8221;. &#8220;With geographical expansion and the rapid increase of word-of-mouth, we now cater to pretty much anyone you’d meet in a supermarket,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asked to share what a typical basket looks like, and therefore what kind of existing grocery habits Gorillas is displacing, Sümer says that users increase their basket size over time as they gain trust in the service and its products. &#8220;Simultaneously, customers are integrating an increasing share of their typical supermarket purchases within their Gorillas orders. This includes fresh goods like fruit and vegetables, as well as products of local suppliers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dark store competition in cities like London &#8212; where Gorillas recently expanded and counts as a key market &#8212; continues to ramp up. This is seeing operators issue vouchers and offer sizeable discounts in a bid to acquire customers fast, while VCs are pumping huge amounts of early-stage cash into a space where unit economics aren&#8217;t yet definitively proven.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn’t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include London’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">Jiffy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/">Dija</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo. </a>There’s also London-based <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which remains in stealth, and heavily backed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdb43495-fadf-4217-bc33-bc52e6f0fdd4">Getir</a>, which started in Turkey but recently also came to London.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S.-founded goPuff &#8212; which this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/">raised another $1.15 billion in funding</a> at a whopping $8.9 billion valuation (compared to $3.9 billion in October) &#8212; is also looking to expand into Europe and has held <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The curbside is being squeezed as the number of commercial vehicle operators and gig economy workers battle over this increasingly scarce real estate — a problem that has been compounded by an uptick in on-demand delivery services fueled by the pandemic.</p>
<p>A number of startups such as Coord and curbflow have popped up in recent years, all aiming to solve this supply and demand problem. One entrant, the three-year-old startup <a href="https://www.automotus.co/">Automotus</a>, is beginning to rack up deployments in zones within cities like Santa Monica, Pittsburgh, Bellevue, Washington and Turin, Italy. A project in Los Angeles is also in the works.</p>
<p>Investors have taken notice as well. The company, which developed video analytics technology to monitor and manage curbsides for cities, said in February it had raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Quake Capital, Techstars Ventures, Kevin Uhlenhaker (the co-founder &amp; CEO at NuPark, which was acquired by Passport) and Baron Davis. CEO Jordan Justus told TechCrunch the company&#8217;s total raise is now $2.3 million. New investors include Ben Bear, Derrick Ko, and Zaizhuang Cheng of micromobility company Spin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is still small, with just 11 full-time employees. However, Justus said the newly raised funds are being used to expand into new markets and to hire more employees.</p>
<p>Automotus uses computer vision technology to capture video of parking zones — places that might be designated for only zero-emissions vehicles or commercial deliveries. Their software handles a variety of functions, including analysis and enforcement. Cities are able to access analytics through a web app. Commercial fleets are able to access information about parking zones via open APIs and in some cases a mobile app, according to Justus.</p>

<p>For instance, one newly announced pilot project with Santa Monica and Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator will monitor a one-square-mile zero-emissions delivery zone in the city. Automotus will provide anonymized data for evaluating the zone’s impacts on delivery efficiency, safety, congestion and emissions, and will make real-time parking availability data available to all zero-emissions delivery zone drivers.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in late 2017 and is a Techstars alum, makes its money primarily through revenue sharing on its enforcement feature. Automotus gets a slice of the payment commercial customers are automatically charged when parking in specific zones, as well as transaction fees on parking violations. While the analytics might help cities set policy or designate pick-up and drop-off zones, it&#8217;s the enforcement feature that Justus says offers the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles used Automotus&#8217; tech to fully automate parking enforcement. Automotus said enforcement efficiency and revenue increased by more than 500%, and added that implementing these measures led to a 24% increase in parking turnover and a 20% reduction in traffic.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;The enforcement component is really critical to the fleet operators because they need to know that these zones are managed efficiently and managed well so that they&#8217;re available for commercial use, if that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re intended for,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.coscreen.co/">CoScreen</a>, a startup that helps teams share screens and collaborate in real-time, formally launched its product to market. It also disclosed that it has raised $4.6 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a> led its Seed round. <a href="https://twitter.com/tillpieper">Till Pieper</a>, CoScreen&#8217;s co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch in an interview that it raised the bulk of its capital pre-pandemic, with the rest coming during 2020 in smaller chunks. A number of angels took part in funding the company, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcwarner/">GitHub CTO Jason Warner</a>.</p>
<p>Why is screen-sharing worth millions in funding, and the time and attention of a whole team? It&#8217;s a good question. Happily the CoScreen team have built something that&#8217;s could prove more than a bit better than what you currently use in Zoom to share puppy pics with your team during meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s CoScreen?</h2>
<p>CoScreen provides screen-sharing capabilities, but in a neat manner. Let&#8217;s say you are on a Mac at your house, and I&#8217;m on a PC at mine. And we need to collab and share some work. I have a document you need to help me edit, and you have an image you want me to view. Using CoScreen, with one click according to Pieper, we can share the two apps across the Internet. Yours will appear on my screen as it was native, and vice versa, and we can both interact with them in real-time.</p>
<p>Or as close to real-time as possible; Pieper told TechCrunch that latency is something that CoScreen will work on forever. Which makes sense, but what the company has built it thinks is good enough to take to market. So, today it&#8217;s launching the service after a period of time in beta for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>CoScreen also has audio and video-chatting capabilities. With limits. You can&#8217;t make video windows too big, for example, helping to keep the mental-load of chatting low. As someone with regular Zoom poisoning, that makes sense.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s project hits me as one of those things that sounds easy but isn&#8217;t. Remember Google Wave? It allowed for instantaneous co-writing. It was amazing. It died. And its successor-of-sorts Google Docs is a laggy mess to this day that feels more quarter-baked than half-done. Real-time tech is not simple.</p>
<p>Is the market too full of apps that allow a version of what CoScreen does for the startup to succeed? Maybe, maybe not. Zoom stormed the already-mature video chat market with a product that <em>actually worked</em>. And so software that I have used has been very good at screen-sharing, let alone sharing <em>and</em> collaborating. So if CoScreen&#8217;s tech is good, the company should have a shot at broad adoption.</p>
<p>Which it is banking on. The startup is currently offering its product for free for a few weeks. It will focus on monetization later, Pieper explained. Making money is just not a burning desire for the firm at the moment, which implies both confidence in its product and bank account.</p>
<p>Closing, the startup is targeting engineers and other agile teams, though I suspect that its product will have wider market remit in time.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we&#8217;ll have to wait for numbers to see what&#8217;s ahead for CoScreen. The company didn&#8217;t share much in the way of usage metrics, which was reasonable given its recent beta status. We&#8217;ll expect more hard figures the next time we chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skycatch today announced a $25 million raise, led by <a href="https://ventures.adb.org/">ADB Ventures</a> and Wavemaker. Founded in 2013, the Bay Area-based company provides centimeter-accurate 3D scanning services, primarily for construction sites and mining operations.</p>
<p>The service has already been rolled out in a number of different locations around the world &#8212; with north of 10,000 sites, according to founder and CEO Christian Sanz. The list includes Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Australia, Canada, the U.S., Indonesia, China, Philippines, Thailand and Japan. In particular, the company is seeking to work with sites where connectivity is limited.</p>
<p>“The process of generating high-precision, centimeter-accurate data is extremely difficult. It typically is owned by the laser scanning market,” says Sanz. “Drones, in general, out of the box are not able to achieve that. We saw the true value prop for Skycatch is operating in edge environments where there’s no connection to internet. That’s where we saw the most demand, initially. That is typically mining companies, operating in all of these remote regions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s technology works with off-the-shelf drones, including ones manufactured by DJI. It provides the 3D mapping software, as well as a base station with an edge processor, known as the Edge 1. Skycatch is also working with off-the-shelf lidar companies to help capture data in more difficult environments, including underground for mining operations.</p>

<p>“Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to play a catalytic role to enable technology in infrastructure projects, which result in reduced carbon footprints and increased safety and operational efficiency,” ADB’s Daniel Hersson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “The enterprise-grade Skycatch technology for capturing, processing and analyzing high accuracy 3D drone data is a critical part to accomplishing that mission.”</p>
<p>The funds will go toward expanding the 50-person company’s sales and marketing team &#8212; both of which have been fairly small portions of the company’s overall headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before even taking its first deposit, <a href="http://www.bankgreenwood.com/">Greenwood</a>, the digital banking service targeting Black and Latino individuals and business owners, has raised $40 million &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/killer-mike-former-atlanta-mayor-andrew-young-and-bounce-tv-founder-ryan-glover-launch-a-digital-bank/">only a few months after its launch</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Coming in to finance the new challenger bank are six of the seven largest U.S. Banks and the payment technology developers Mastercard and Visa.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Bank of America, PNC, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Truist, are backing a bank co-founded by a man who declared, &#8220;I&#8217;m with the revolutionary. I&#8217;m with the radical policy,&#8221; when stumping for then Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Joining the financial services giants in the round are FIS, a behind-the-scenes financial services tech developer; along with the venture capital firms TTV Capital, SoftBank Group&#8217;s SB Opportunity Fund, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sports investors Quality Control and All-Pro NFL running back Alvin Kamara also came in to finance the latest round.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Greenwood was launched last October by a group that included former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young and Bounce TV founder, Ryan Glover.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The net worth of a typical white family is nearly ten times greater than that of a Black family and eight times greater than that of a Latino family. This wealth gap is a curable injustice that requires collaboration,&#8221; said \ Glover, Chairman and Co-founder of Greenwood, in a statement. &#8220;The backing of six of the top seven banks and the two largest payment technology companies is a testament to the contemporary influence of the Black and Latino community. We now are even better positioned to deliver the world-class services our customers deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Named after the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Okla., which was known as the Black Wall Street before it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre">destroyed in a 1921 massacre</a>, the digital bank promises to <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">donate the equivalent of five free meals to an organization addressing food insecurity for every person who signs up to the bank. And every time a customer uses a Greenwood debit card, the bank will make a donation to either the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://uncf.org/">United Negro College Fund</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.goodr.co/">Goodr</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (an organization that addresses food insecurity) or the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>In addition, each month the bank will provide a $10,000 grant to a Black or Latinx small business owner that uses the company’s financial services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Truist Ventures is helping to inspire and build better lives and communities by leading the Series A funding round for Greenwood&#8217;s innovative approach to building greater trust in banking within Black and Latino communities,&#8221; said Truist Chief Digital and Client Experience Officer Dontá L. Wilson who oversees Truist Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;In addition to the opportunity to work with and learn from this distinguished group of founders, our investment in Greenwood is reflective of our purpose and commitment to advancing economic empowerment of minority and underserved communities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 500,000 people have signed up for the wait list to bank with Greenwood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the world shifted toward virtual one year ago, one service in particular saw heated demand: digital notary services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to get a document notarized without leaving one’s home suddenly became more of a necessity than a luxury. Pat Kinsel, founder and CEO of Boston-based Notarize, worked to get appropriate legislation passed across the country to make it possible for more people in more states to use remote online notarization (RON) services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hard work has paid off. Today, Notarize has announced $130 million in Series D funding led by fintech-focused VC firm </span><a href="https://canapi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after experiencing 600% year over year revenue growth. The round values Notarize at $760 million, which is triple its valuation at the time of its $35 million Series C in March of 2020. This latest round is larger than the sum of all of the company’s previous rounds to date, and brings Notarize’s total raised to $213 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of other investors participated in the round, including Alphabet’s independent growth fund CapitalG, Citi Ventures, Wells Fargo, True Bridge Capital Partners and existing backers Camber Creek, Ludlow Ventures, NAR’s Second Century Ventures, and Fifth Wall Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notarize insists that it “isn’t just a notary company.” Rather, Canapi Ventures Partner Neil Underwood described it as the ‘last mile’ of businesses (such as iBuyers, for example). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also evolved to “also bring trust and identity verification” into those businesses’ processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Notarize has seen a massive increase in transactions and inked new partnerships with companies such as Adobe, Dropbox, Stripe and Zillow Group, among others. It’s seen big spikes in demand from the real estate, financial services, retail and automotive sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, the world rushed to digitize. Online commerce ballooned, and businesses in almost every industry needed to transition to digital basically overnight so they could continue uninterrupted,” Kinsel said. “Notarize was there to help them safely close these deals with trust and convenience.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its platform and product and scale “to serve enterprises of all sizes.” It also plans to double down on hiring in the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Notarize is disrupting outdated business models and technologies, and there’s massive potential, particularly in the financial services space, as more companies will need to offer secure digital alternatives to in-person transactions,” Canapi’s Underwood said.</span></p>
<p>Notarize&#8217;s success comes after a difficult 2019, when the company saw &#8220;critical financing&#8221; fall through and had to lay off staff, according to Kinsel. Talk about a turnaround story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data centers and bitcoin mining operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/the-debate-about-cryptocurrency-and-energy-consumption/">are becoming huge energy hogs</a> and the explosive growth of both risks undoing a lot of the progress that&#8217;s been made to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It&#8217;s one of the major criticisms of cryptocurrency operations and something that many in the industry are trying to address.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.liquidstack.com/">LiquidStack</a>, a company that&#8217;s spinning out from the cryptocurrency hardware technology developer <a href="https://bitfury.com/">Bitfury Group</a> with a $10 million investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which was formerly known as Allied Control Limited, restructured as a commercial operating company headquartered in the Netherlands with commercial operations in the U.S. and research and development in Hong Kong, according to a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">It was first acquired by Bitfury in 2015 after building a 2-phase immersion cooling 500kW data center in Hong Kong, that purportedly cut energy consumption by 95% versus traditional air cooling technologies. Later, the companies jointly deployed 160 megawatts of 2-phase immersion cooled data centers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitfury has been innovating across multiple industries and sees major growth opportunities with LiquidStack’s game-changing cooling solutions for compute-intensive applications and infrastructure,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury. “I believe LiquidStack’s leadership team, together with our customers and strategic support from Wiwynn, will rapidly accelerate the global adoption and deployment of 2-phase immersion cooling.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The $10 million in funding came from the Taiwanese conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wiwynn.com/">Wiwynn</a>, a data center and infrastructure developer with revenues of $6.3 billion last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Wiwynn continues to invest in advanced cooling solutions to address the challenges of fast-growing power consumption and density for cloud computing, AI, and HPC,” said Emily Hong, chief executive of Wiwynn, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, LiquidStack said its technology could enable at least 21 times more heat rejection per IT rack compared to air cooling &#8212; all without the need for water. The company said its cooling method results in a 41 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 60 percent reduction in data center space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitfury has always been focused on leading by example and is a technology driven company from the top of the organization, to its grass roots,” said Joe Capes, co-founder and chief executive of LiquidStack, in a statement. “Launching LiquidStack with new funding enables us to focus on our strengths and capabilities, accelerating the development of liquid cooling technology, products and services to help solve real thermal and sustainability challenges driven by the adoption of cloud services, AI, edge and high-performance computing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plant-based meat replacements have commanded a huge amount of investor and consumer attention in the decade or more since new entrants like Beyond Meat first burst onto the scene.</p>
<p>These companies have raised billions of dollars and the industry <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/25/the-plant-based-meat-industry-is-on-the-rise-but-challenges-remain.html">is now worth at least $20 billion</a> as companies try to bring all the meaty taste of&#8230; um&#8230; meat&#8230; without all of the nasty environmental damage&#8230; to supermarket aisles and restaurants around the world.</p>
<p>Switching to a plant-based diet is probably the single most meaningful contribution a person can make to reducing their personal greenhouse gas emissions (without buying an electric vehicle or throwing solar panels on their roof).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem that continues to bedevil the industry is that there remains a pretty big chasm between the taste of these meat replacements and actual meat, no matter how many advancements startups notch in making better proteins or new additives like Impossible Foods&#8217; heme. Today, meat replacement companies depend on palm oil and coconut oil for their fats &#8212; both inputs that come with their own set of environmental issues.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://nourishing.io/">Nourish Ingredients</a>, which is focusing not on the proteins, but the fats that make tasty meats tasty. Consumers can&#8217;t have delicious, delicious bacon without fat, and they can&#8217;t have a marvelously marbled steak replacements without it either.</p>
<p>The Canberra, Australia-based company has raised $11 million from Horizons Ventures, the firm backed by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing (also a backer of Impossible Foods), and Main Sequence Ventures, an investment firm founded by Australia&#8217;s national science agency, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</span>.</p>
<p>That organization is actually where the company&#8217;s two co-founders <span style="font-weight: 400;">James Petrie and Ben Leita met back in 2013 while working as scientists. Petrie, a specialist in crop development, was spearheading the development of omega-3 canola oil, while Leita had a background in chemistry and bioplastics.  </span></p>
<p>The two had previously worked on a company that was trying to increase oil production in plants,<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/news-releases/2017/australias-next-oil-boom-might-just-come-from-plants"> something that the CSRO had been particularly interested in circa 2017</a>. As the market for alternative meats really began to take off, the two entrepreneurs turned their attention to trying to make corollaries for animal fats.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When we were talking to people we realized that these alternative food space was going to need these animal fat like plants,&#8221; said Leita. &#8220;We could use that skillset for fish oil and out of canola oil.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Nourish&#8217;s innovation was in moving from plants to bacteria. &#8220;With the iteration speeds, it feels kind of like we&#8217;re cheating,&#8221; said Petrie. &#8220;You can get the cost of goods pretty damn low.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nourish Ingredients uses bacteria or organisms that make significant amounts of triglycerides and lipids. &#8220;Examples include Yarrowia. There are examples of that being used for production of tailored oils,&#8221; said Petrie. &#8220;We can tune these oleaginous organisms to make these animal fats that give us that great taste and experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>As both men noted, fats are really important for flavor. They&#8217;re a key differentiator in what makes different meats taste different, they said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The cow makes cow fat because that’s what the cow does, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it’s the best fat for a plant protein,&#8221; said Petrie. &#8220;We start out with a mimetic. No reason for us to be locked by the original organism. We’re trying to create new experiences. There are new experiences out there to be had.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company already counts several customers in both the plant and recombinant protein production space. Now, with 18 employees, the company is producing both genetically modified and non-CRISPR cultivated optimized fats. </span></p>
<p>Other startups and established businesses also have technologies that could allow them to enter this new market. Those would be businesses like Geltor, which is currently focused on collagen, or Solazyme, which makes a range of bio-based specialty oils and chemicals.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As active investors in the alternative protein space, we realize that animal-free fats that replicate the taste of traditional meat, poultry and seafood products are the next breakthrough in the industry,” said Phil Morle, partner at Main Sequence Ventures. “Nourish have discovered how to do just that in a way that’s sustainable and incredibly tasty, and we couldn’t be happier to join them at this early stage.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pieinsurance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup offering workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses, announced this morning that it has closed on $118 million in a Series C round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allianz X &#8212; investment arm of German financial services giant Allianz &#8212; and Acrew Capital co-led the round, which brings the Washington, D.C.-based startup’s total equity funding raised to over $300 million since its 2017 inception. Pie declined to disclose the valuation at which its latest round was raised, other than to say it was “a significant increase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return backers Greycroft, SVB Capital, SiriusPoint, Elefund and Moxley Holdings also participated in the Series C financing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which uses data and analytics in its effort to offer SMBs a way to get insurance digitally and more affordably, has seen its revenues climb by 150% since it raised $127 million in a Series B extension last May. Its headcount too has risen &#8212; to 260 from 140 last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie began selling its insurance policies in March 2018. The company declined to give recent hard revenue numbers, saying it only has g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rown its gross written premium to over $100 million and partnered with over 1,000 agencies nationwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, execs told me that in the first quarter of 2020, the company had written nearly $19 million in premiums, up 150% from just under $7.5 million during the same period in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies over the past year, Pie Insurance &#8212; with its internet-driven, cloud-based platform &#8212; has benefited from the increasing further adoption of digital technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are riding that wave,” said Pie Insurance co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Swigart. “We believe small businesses deserve better than they have historically gotten. And we think that technology can be the means by which that better experience, that more efficient process, and fundamentally, that lower price can be delivered to them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie’s customer base includes a range of small businesses including trades, contractors, landscapers, janitors, auto shops and restaurants. Pie sells its insurance directly through its website and also mostly through thousands of independent insurance agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers&#8217; compensation insurance is the only commercial insurance mandated for every company in the United States, points out Lauren Kolodny, founding partner at Acrew Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Historically, it&#8217;s been extremely cumbersome to qualify, onboard and manage workers&#8217; comp insurance &#8212; particularly for America&#8217;s small businesses which haven&#8217;t been prioritized by larger carriers,” she wrote via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie, Koldony said, is able to offer underwriting decisions “almost instantly,” digitally and more affordably than legacy insurance carriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have seen very few insurtech teams that come close,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Nazim Cetin, CEO of Allianz X, told TechCrunch via email that his firm believes Pie is operating in an “attractive and growing market that is ripe for digital disruption.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, he said, leverages “excellent,” proprietary data and advanced analytics to be able to provide tailored underwriting and automation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see some great collaboration opportunities with Allianz companies too,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to invest further in technology and automation, as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to grow its core workers’ comp insurance business and “lay the groundwork for new business offerings in 2021 and beyond.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the slower weeks for robotics investments I’ve seen since I started doing this roundup. This stuff ebbs and flows, though, and there’s always bound to be a bit of a flurry at the beginning of the year. This week, most of the top news revolves around research, which, let’s be honest, is where most of the really fun stuff happens, anyway.</p>
<p>The other week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/robotics-roundup-2/">I spent a couple of paragraphs</a> talking about why soft robots are interesting and important, but of course, they have their limitations. Like everything else in tech, choosing one version has its plusses and minuses. In the pro column, you can have additional compliance and flexibility. But one of the trade-offs is conductivity.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tiny-silver-flakes-can-improve-conductivity-in-soft-robots/">clever new research out of Carnegie Mellon University</a> applies micrometer-sized silver flakes to soft materials like hydrogels, creating what the team likens to, “a second layer of nervous tissue over your skin.” Soft robotics created in this matter could eventually be used for medical purposes, including treatments for stroke patients and people suffering from tremors related to Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/de/news/underwater-swimming-robot-responds-with-feedback-from-soft-lateral-line">published its own soft robotics research</a> this week, alongside Seoul National University and Harvard University. Like a lot of the work in the category, the team is focused on a model inspired by marine life. Here we’re looking at a robotic fish that adjusts its undulation based on the water around it. It’s some interesting insight into how fish move and could be useful in producing soft underwater robots, going forward.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSa7D0FvxqY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Researchers at MIT, meanwhile, are exploring the proper placement of sensors on soft robotics to help give them a better picture of their environment. This points to another issue with soft robotics: their compliance means they often have a more difficult time determining moving based on their environment. So the team has devised a neural network that could optimize sensor placement.</p>

<p>There is still some robotics investment news this week. Fort Robotics made some waves with a $13 million raise. Unlike a lot of the recent rounds we’ve looked at, the Philadelphia company has a software focus. Specifically, it develops a layer for robotic systems designed to help keep companies safe from a wide range of different issues, from cybersecurity to system failure.</p>
<p>Pieter Abbeel, the director of UC Berkeley’s Robot Learning Lab, has been onstage for a few of our annual TC Sessions: Robotics event. He reached out to let us know that he’s<a href="https://www.therobotbrains.ai/"> just launched an interview series</a> about AI and robotics that will no doubt be a worthwhile listen, if you’re interested at all in the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-25/introducing-a-new-spotify-experience-across-desktop-app-and-web-player/">announced</a> it&#8217;s rolling out a new look for its streaming service on the desktop, with the launch of a redesigned app for both Mac and Windows, as well as an updated web app. The changes, which will be made available to all global users, focus on improving the navigation and providing users with access to new controls and features across playlists, search, radio, their queue, library, and more.</p>
<p>Overall, the update gives the Spotify app a more streamlined, less cluttered look and feel, compared with the prior version.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130003" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130003" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/After-downloaded-music-Playlist-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130003" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One notable change is that the new app does away with the oddly placed search bar that was <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/69939iF2012CA018E8ACA7/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999">previously found at the top left of the screen.</a> Now it&#8217;s been relocated to the slimmed down navigation bar on the left side, in between the links for Home and Your Library.</p>
<p>The app also no longer details the various destinations within Your Library within this navigation bar &#8212; like Made For You, Recently Played, Albums, Artists or Podcasts, for example. Instead, you&#8217;ll have to click into your Library section to view these selections.</p>
<p>Now, the Your Library page will feature four categories across the top of the page, starting with Playlists, where you&#8217;ll find your Liked Songs, Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes, Release Radar, and more. Playlists is followed by different sections for browsing Podcasts (which got bumped up to the No. 2 spot in the update! hint hint!), then Artists and Albums.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130005" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130005" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130005" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore-new-filters-in-Library.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130005" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>A new dropdown menu in the Your Library lets you further sort these various sections in a variety of ways: by Most Relevant, Recently Played, Recently Added, Alphabetical, or even by a Custom Order you can configure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who like to build playlists will gain a handful of new features in the updated app.</p>
<p>They can now write descriptions, upload their own images, and drag and drop tracks into existing playlists. They can also use a new embedded search bar located at the top of the &#8220;Create Playlist&#8221; page to seek out new songs or even podcast episodes to add to the playlist. This could greatly speed up the somewhat tedious process of playlist creation, by reducing the steps it takes between finding a track and getting it into a playlist.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130006" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130006" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Playlist-creation_song-added-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130006" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>This change in particular speaks to Spotify&#8217;s growing interest in catering to curators &#8212; something co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek mentioned <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel">during his recent appearance on the PressClub show on Clubhouse</a>.</p>
<p>Ek explained that he was &#8220;excited about curatorship&#8221; because when a service&#8217;s content library grows, it needs curators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The playlisters are incredible on Spotify, but it seems like there&#8217;s limited ability to interact with those playlisters &#8212; or for those playlisters to really understand who is listening to them and be able to build that second set of creators [who] are indirectly creating by helping other people find content to experience,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, Ek said Spotify would try to add more tools to allow users to become better curators, if not on a social basis, at least for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary focus for us on the roadmap is just enabling you to be a much better curator even for yourself &#8212;  just by, for instance, suggesting content that&#8217;s relevant to the things you&#8217;ve already put in the playlist,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>These updated playlist creation tools seem like a natural first step towards Spotify&#8217;s larger goals in this area.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130007" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130007" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130007" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=768,294 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=1536,587 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Static-banner-single-desktop.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130007" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>A few other changes in the updated apps include a refreshed listener profile page which now features both your top artists and top tracks; a new way to start a radio session for any song or artist via the three-dot (&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;) more menu; and the ability to now edit your Queue and view your Recently Played items on the Desktop app.</p>
<p>Premium subscribers gain another perk, too: they&#8217;ll be able to download music and podcasts to listen to offline, via a download button in the Desktop app.</p>
<p>In a blog post announcing the changes, Spotify admitted that it hadn&#8217;t quite kept up with the development of its desktop app as its service had grown, and today&#8217;s launch is an attempt to correct that.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we’re always looking for ways to provide the best possible experience so our listeners can consistently discover and enjoy music and podcasts—and that includes look, feel, and functionality. We constantly test, develop, and launch new features, optimize for new devices, and look to expand our content offering,&#8221; the post read. &#8220;Yet along the way, we felt that our desktop app experience hadn’t kept up, and that it was time for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The updated apps for Mac, Windows and the web are rolling out starting today. Unrelated to the app redesign, Spotify <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/marquee-make-noise-when-it-matters-most">separately announced</a> today it&#8217;s expanding access to its Marquee tool for promoting new releases. The feature will be made available to all teams in the U.S. through a new campaign management tool in Spotify for Artists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, localized payments provider PPRO became the latest fintech-as-a-service startup to hit a billion-dollar valuation when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/ppro-nabs-180m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-bring-together-the-fragmented-world-of-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed $180 million in funding</a>. As a mark of how payments and e-commerce continue to be major areas of focus in the global economy, today PPRO is extending that round by another $90 million and adding in two new investors to its cap table.</p>
<p>The financing is coming by way of strategic backing from JPMorgan Chase, and Eldridge (which is the second time this week the PE firm has been in the news for making a major investment in an enterprise tech company: earlier this week Eldridge was one of the leads on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$475 million round for real-time intelligence provider Dataminr</a>).</p>
<p>The enlarged $270 million round &#8212; the January tranche was from Eurazeo Growth, Sprints Capital and Wellington Management &#8212; includes both primary and secondary capital, and this latest tranche is part of the secondary element, PPRO CEO Simon Black confirmed to me. Prior to this, London-based PPRO (pronounced &#8216;P-pro&#8217;) raised <a href="https://www.ppro.com/news/ppro-announces-85-volume-growth-despite-pandemic-accelerates-plans-with-new-investment-from-sprints-and-citi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$50 million </a><a href="https://www.ppro.com/news/ppro-announces-85-volume-growth-despite-pandemic-accelerates-plans-with-new-investment-from-sprints-and-citi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in August 2020</a> from Sprints, Citi and HPE Growth; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/paypal-leads-50m-round-for-cross-border-payment-specialist-ppro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018 it raised</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/paypal-leads-50m-round-for-cross-border-payment-specialist-ppro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$50 million</a> led by strategic investor PayPal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PPRO&#8217;s core product is a set of APIs that e-commerce companies can integrate into their check-outs to accept payments in whatever local methods and currencies consumers prefer, removing the need for PPRO customers to build those complex and messy integrations themselves. Its business has boomed in the last year as one of the bigger providers of that localized payment technology, with transaction volumes up 60% in 2020 to $11 billion in processed payments.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is one of the world&#8217;s financial giants, providing banking and credit cards among its many other services. The idea is that it wants to build more payment services around its existing relationships and to expand its payment business globally, working more closely with PPRO as part of that. There are two main areas where PPRO could figure: to help its credit card business gain more ubiquity as a payment method in more parts of the globe; and to be a service provider for its business banking customers to help them expand in more markets with more flexible, localized payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are extending into payments and we are looking to double down on addressing the needs of our clients and their clients, which can be consumers, suppliers or marketplace sellers,&#8221; said Sanjay Saraf, MD and Global Head of the Integrated Payments Group at JPMorgan Chase, in an interview. &#8220;That last mile becomes important from a customer service perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>In particular, the US company is hoping to double down on its business and footprint in Latin America and Asia Pacific, two emerging markets still seeing a lot of growth in e-commerce, in particular compared to more developed, penetrated and mature markets like the U.S.</p>
<p>This latest round of financing underscores two trends of the moment in fintech.</p>
<p>First, it points to how active the e-commerce market has become &#8212; a trend fueled not in small part by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the resulting shift people have made to carrying out everyday tasks online. Second, it&#8217;s a sign of how global financial services companies are looking for ways to remain relevant in every market, tapping into more innovations from fintech startups to get there.</p>
<p>The problem, as it exists, is that payments remains a very fragmented business.</p>
<p>The standard methods that a person might use to pay for goods or services online in one country &#8212; for example a credit card in the U.S. &#8212; might differ drastically from the preferred methods when selling in another &#8212; for example, in Belguim one popular format is Bancontact (where you visit a new screen to authorize a transfer from directly from your bank checking account).</p>
<p>As with other payments and fintech-as-a-service startups, the attraction of using PPRO is that it has built a lot of those integrations at the backend and packaged them up as a service, taking away a lot of the complexity, in its case of identifying and integrating each of those payment methods manually, and making it something that can be done seamlessly and quickly.</p>
<p>JPMorgan is now one of several other partners. Those relationships work in both directions, providing partners a way to expand their consumer-facing products, and to help them work with more businesses in more markets. (Similar, I suspect to how JPMorgan will work with it, too.)</p>
<p>Others in PPRO&#8217;s network of 100 large global customers include PayPal, Citi, Mastercard Payment Gateway Services, Mollie and Worldpay, which use PPRO&#8217;s APIs for a variety of functions, including localised gateway, processing and merchant acquirer services.</p>
<p>It is also not the only one that has identified the opportunity to simplify this part of the payment process and of other complex financial transactions that rely on localized approaches. Others in the same area include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapyd</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a>, <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a>, <a href="http://adyen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adyen</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> and newer players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit</a>, with many of these raising very large amounts of money in recent times to double down on what is currently a rapidly expanding market.</p>
<p>The past year has been &#8220;an acceleration of a trend, where behaviors are being reinforced,&#8221; said Black in an interview. &#8220;At the consumer level, we are buying so many more products and services online, and we value convenience more than ever, which translates to a real strengthening of more demand for local payments.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while emerging technologies like cryptocurrency continue to see a lot of buzz, this is not at all where mass-market activity is for now. &#8220;The big trend is mobile wallets, not bitcoin,&#8221; Black said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Brazilian-based pan-Latin American food delivery startup iFood <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://institucional.ifood.com.br/solucoes-sustentaveis/">has announced a series of initiatives designed to reduce the company&#8217;s environmental impact</a> as consumers push companies to focus more on sustainability.</p>
<p>The program has two main components &#8212; one focused on plastic pollution and waste and another aiming to become carbon neutral in its operations by 2025.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most ambitious, and surely the most capital intensive of the company&#8217;s waste reduction initiatives is the development of a semi-automated recycling facility in Sao Paulo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to transform the entire supply chain for plastic-free packaging in Brazil. By controlling the national supply chain, from production to marketing and logistics, we can offer more competitive pricing for packaging to industries that already exist but do not have a scale of production and demand today,” said  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-vitti-456b4a39">Gustavo Vitti</a>, the chief people and sustainability officer at iFood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company has also created an in-app option that allows customers to decline plastic cutlery when they&#8217;re getting their food delivered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These initiatives will contribute to reducing the consumption of plastic items, which are often sent without being requested and end up going unused into the garbage bin,” said Vitti. &#8220;In the first tests that we did, 90 percent of consumers used the resource, which resulted in the reduction of tens of thousands of plastic cutlery and shows our consumers’ desire to receive less waste in their homes.&#8221;</span><b></b></p>
<p>On the emissions front, the company will work with<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://moss.earth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moss.Earth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technology company in the carbon market, which developed the GHG inventory to offset its emissions by buying credits tied to environmental preservation and reforestation projects. </span></p>
<p>But the company is also working <a href="https://tembici.com.br/">Tembici</a>, a provider of electric bikes in Brazil to move its delivery fleet off of internal combustion powered mopeds or scooters.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tembici raises $47M Series B to expand its fleet of electric bikes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/tembici-raises-47m-series-b-to-expand-its-fleet-of-electric-bikes/embed/#?secret=jo1vED9tH3" data-secret="jo1vED9tH3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that compensation alone is not enough. It is necessary to think of innovative ways to reduce CO2 emissions. In October last year, we launched the </span><a href="https://entregador.ifood.com.br/quero-fazer-parte/ifood-pedal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iFood Pedal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, in partnership with </span><a href="https://tembici.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tembici</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project developed exclusively for couriers that offers affordable plans for renting electric bikes,&#8221; said Vitti. &#8220;Currently, more than 2,000 couriers are registered and are sharing 1,000 electric bikes in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in addition to the educational aspect of program that we have contemplated. With good adherence indicators, our plan is to gradually expand the project, taking it to other cities and, thus, increase our percentage of clean deliveries.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brazilian electric motorcycle company, <a href="https://voltzmotors.com/">Voltz Motors</a> is also working with iFood, which ordered 30 electric motorcycles for use by some of its delivery partners. The company hopes to roll out more than 10,000 motorcycles over the next 12 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupled with internal facing initiatives to improve water reuse, deploy renewable energy and develop a green roof at its Osasco headquarters, iFood is hoping to hit sustainability goals that can improve the environment across Brazil and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know that we have a long way to go, but we trust that together with important partners and this set of initiatives, in addition to others that are under development, it will be possible to reduce plastic generation and CO2 emissions impact on the environment. Our relevance and presence in the lives of Brazilian families further reinforces the importance of these environmental commitments for the planet,” said Vitti.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clothing giant FatFace had a data breach, but doesn&#8217;t want you to tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>The company sent an email to customers this week disclosing that it first detected a breach on January 17. A hacker made off with the customer&#8217;s name, email and postal address, and the last four-digits of their credit card. &#8220;Full payment card information was not compromised,&#8221; the notice reiterated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of experienced security specialists who, following thorough investigation, determined that an unauthorized third party had gained access to certain systems operated by us during a limited period of time earlier the same month,&#8221; the email said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But despite going out to thousands of customers, the email said to &#8220;keep this email and the information included within it strictly private and confidential,&#8221; an entirely unenforceable request.</p>
<p>Under the U.K. data protection laws, a company must disclose a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of an incident, but there are no legal requirements on the customer to keep the information confidential. It didn&#8217;t take long for the company to <a href="https://twitter.com/NotTimorous/status/1374836443344932872">face flack</a> from the public. The company didn&#8217;t have much to say in response, asking instead to &#8220;DM us with any questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement sent via crisis communications firm Kekst CNC, FatFace said: &#8220;The notification email was marked private and confidential due to the nature of the communication, which was intended for the individual concerned. Given its contents, we wanted to make this clear, which is why we marked it private and confidential.&#8221; (FatFace declined to attribute the statement to a named spokesperson.)</p>
<p>TechCrunch obtained a near-identical email sent to its staff from a former employee who asked not to be named. The email to employees was largely the same as the customer email, but warned that staff may have had their bank account information and their National Insurance numbers — the U.K. equivalent of Social Security — compromised.</p>
<p>FatFace confirmed &#8220;a select number of employees, former employees and customers and providing appropriate guidance and support,&#8221; but would not say specifically how many customers and employees were affected by the breach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The home medical supply market in the U.S. is significant and growing, but the way that Americans go about getting much-needed medical supplies, particularly for those with chronic conditions, relies on outdated and clumsy sales mechanisms that often have very poor customer experiences. New startup Better Health aims to change that, with an e-commerce approach to serving customers in need of medical supplies for chronic conditions, and it has raised $3.5 million in a new seed round to pursue its goals.</p>
<p>Better Health estimates the total value of the home medical supplies market in the U.S., which covers all reimbursable devices and supplies needed for chronic conditions, including things like colostomy bags, catheters, mobility aids, insulin pumps and more, is around $60 billion annually. But the market is obviously a specialized one relative to other specialized goods businesses, in part because it requires working not only with customers who make the final decisions about what supplies to use, but also payers, who typically foot the bill through insurance reimbursements.</p>
<p>The other challenge is that individuals with chronic care needs often require a lot of guidance and support when making the decision about what equipment and supplies to select — and the choices they make can have a significant impact on quality of life. Better Health co-founder and CEO Naama Stauber Breckler explained how she came to identify the problems in the industry, and why she set out to address them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The first company I started was right out of school, it&#8217;s called CompactCath,&#8221; she explained in an interview. &#8220;We created a novel intermittent catheter, because we identified that there&#8217;s a gap in the existing options for people with chronic bladder issues that need to use a catheter on a day-to-day basis [&#8230;] In the process of bringing it to market, I was exposed to the medical devices and supplies industry. I was just shocked when I realized how hard it is for people today to get life-saving medical supplies, and basically realized that it&#8217;s not just about inventing a better product, there&#8217;s kind of a bigger systematic problem that locks consumer choice, and also prevents innovation in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stauber Breckler&#8217;s founding story isn&#8217;t too dissimilar from the founding story of another e-commerce pioneer: Shopify. The now-public heavyweight originally got started when founder Tobi Lütke, himself a software engineer like Stauber Breckler, found that the available options for running his online snowboard store were poorly designed and built. With Better Health, she&#8217;s created a marketplace, rather than a platform like Shopify, but the pain points and desire to address the problem at a more fundamental level are the same.</p>

<p>With CompactCath, she said they ended up having to build their own direct-to-consumer marketing and sales product, and through that process, they ended up talking to thousands of customers with chronic conditions about their experiences, and what they found exposed the extend of the problems in the existing market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kept hearing the same stories again, and again — it&#8217;s hard to find the right supplier, often it&#8217;s a local store, the process is extremely manual and lengthy and prone to errors, they get the surprise bills they weren&#8217;t expecting,&#8221; Stauber Breckler said. &#8220;But mostly, it&#8217;s just that there is this really sharp drop in care, from the time that you have a surgery or you were diagnosed, to when you need to now start using this device, when you&#8217;re essentially left at home and are given a general prescription.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike in the prescription drug market, where your choices essentially amount to whether you pick the brand name or the generic, and the outcome is pretty much the same regardless, in medical supplies which solution you choose can have a dramatically different effect on your experience. Customers might not be aware, for example, that something like CompactCath exists, and would instead chose a different catheter option that limits their mobility because of how frequently it needs changing and how intensive the process is. Physicians and medical professionals also might not be the best to advise them on their choice, because while they&#8217;ve obviously seen patients with these conditions, they generally haven&#8217;t lived with them themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have talked to people who tell us, &#8216;I&#8217;ve had an ostomy for 19 years, and this is the first time I don&#8217;t have constant leakages&#8217; or someone who had been using a catheter for three years and hasn&#8217;t left her house for more than two hours, because they didn&#8217;t feel comfortable with the product that they had to use it in a public restroom,&#8221; Stauber Breckler said. &#8220;So they told us things like &#8216;I finally went to visit my parents, they live in a town three hours away.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Better Health can provide this kind fo clarity to customers because it employs advisors who can talk patients through the equipment selection process with one-to-one coaching and product use education. The startup also helps with navigating the insurance side, managing paperwork, estimating costs and even arguing the case for a specific piece of equipment in case of difficulty getting the claim approved. The company leverages peers who have first-hand experience with the chronic conditions it serves to help better serve its customers.</p>
<p>Already, Better Health is a Medicare-licensed provider in 48 states, and it has partnerships in place with commercial providers like Humana and Oscar Health. This funding round was led by 8VC, a firm with plenty of expertise in the healthcare industry and an investor in Stauber Breckler&#8217;s prior ventures, and includes participation from Caffeinated Capital, Anorak Ventures, and angels Robert Hurley and Scott Flanders of remote health pioneer eHealth.</p>
