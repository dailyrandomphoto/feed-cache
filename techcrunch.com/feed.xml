					<description><![CDATA[RSA Security has spun out its fraud and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rsa-security/">RSA Security</a> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fraud/">fraud</a> and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/threatmetrix/">ThreatMetrix</a>, the new company will focus solely on fraud detection and management and payments authentication services.</p>
<p>Outseer will continue to operate under the RSA umbrella and will inherit three core services, which are already used by more than 6,000 financial institutions, from the company: Outseer Fraud Manager (formerly RSA Adaptive Authentication), a risk-based account monitoring service; 3-D Secure (formerly Adaptive Authentication for eCommerce), a card-not-present and digital payment authentication mapping service; and FraudAction, which detects and takes down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> sites, dodgy apps and fraudulent social media pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outseer says its product portfolio is supported by deep investments in data and science, including a global network of verified fraud and transaction data, and a risk engine that the company claims delivers 95% fraud detection rates.</p>
<p>Commenting on the spinout, Taussig said: “Outseer is the culmination of decades of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions. As the digital economy continues to deepen, the Outseer mission to liberate the world from transactional fraud is essential. Our role as a revenue enabler for the global economy will only strengthen as every digital business continues to scale.”</p>
<p>RSA, meanwhile, will continue to focus on integrated risk management and security products, including Archer for risk management, NetWitness for threat detection and response, and SecureID for identity and access management (IAM) capabilities.</p>
<p>The spinout comes less than a year after private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">which recently bought FireEye’s product business for $1.2 billion</a>, acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">RSA Security from Dell Technologies for more than $2 billion</a>. Dell had previously acquired RSA as part of its purchase of EMC in 2016.</p>
<p>It also comes amid a huge rise in online fraud fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission said in March that more than 217,000 Americans had filed a coronavirus-related fraud report since January 2020, with losses to COVID-linked fraud totaling $382 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 542,300 fraud complaints in 2020, a 54% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>RSA said that with the COVID-19 pandemic having fueled “unprecedented” growth in fraudulent transactions, Outseer will focus its innovation on payments authentication, mapping to the EMV 3-D Secure 2.x payment standard, and incorporating new technology integrations across the payments and commerce ecosystem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Outseer’s reason for being isn’t just focused on eliminating payments and account fraud,” Taussig added. “These fraudulent transactions are often the pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking, terrorism, and other nefarious behavior. Outseer has the ability to help make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>Valuation information for Outseer was not disclosed, nor were headcount figures mentioned in the spinout announcement. Outseer didn&#8217;t immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear outcome of the pandemic was pushing more people to do their shopping online, and that was as true for B2B as it was for B2C. Knowing which of your B2B customers are most likely to convert puts any sales team ahead of the game. <a href="https://www.slintel.com/">Slintel</a>, a startup providing that kind of data, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted some big-name investors with GGV leading the round and Accel, Sequoia and Stellaris also participating. The investment brings the total raised to over $24 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/slintel-grabs-4-2m-seed-to-expand-sales-intelligence-platform/">a $4.2 million seed round</a> from last November.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a quick turnaround from seed to A, and company founder and CEO Deepak Anchala, says that while he had plenty of runway left from the seed round, the demand was such that it seemed prudent to take the A money sooner than he had planned. &#8220;So we had enough cash in the bank, but investors came to us and we got a pretty good valuation compared to the previous round, so we decided to take it and use that money to go faster,&#8221; Anchala said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly the market dynamics were working in Slintel&#8217;s favor. Without giving revenue details, Anchala said that revenue grew 5x last year in the middle of the worst of the pandemic. He says that meant buyers were spending less time with sales and marketing folks to understand products and more time online researching on their own.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/">Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=TQCSY7jHBh" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So what Slintel does as a product is we mine buyer insights. We understand where the buyers are in their journey, what their pain points are, what products they use, what they need and when they need it. So we understand all of this to create a 360 degree view of the buyer that you provide these insights to sales and marketing teams to help them sell better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After growing at such a rapid clip last year, the company expected more modest growth this year at perhaps 3x, but with the added investment, he expects to grow faster again. &#8220;With the funding we&#8217;re actually looking at much bigger numbers. We&#8217;re looking at 5x in our revenue this year, and also trying for 4x revenue next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that the money gives him the opportunity to improve the product and put more investment into marketing, which he believes will contribute to additional sales. Since the round closed 6 weeks ago, he says that he has increased his advertising budget and is also hopes to attract customers via SEO, free tools on the company website and events.</p>
<p>The company had 45 employees at the time of its seed round in November and has more than doubled that number in the interim to 100 spread out across 10 cities. He expects to double again by this time next year as the company is growing quickly. As a global company with some employees in India and some in the U.S., he intends to be remote first even after offices begin to reopen in different areas. He says that he plans to have company gatherings each quarter to let people gather in person on occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/kn0thing?lang=en">Alexis Ohanian</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital/">he was leaving Initialized Capital</a>, the venture firm he co-founded alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a> in 2011. Nearly a year later, he&#8217;s announcing that his new venture firm, <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Seven Seven Six</a>, has raised $150 million for its first fund.</p>
<p>Seven Seven Six is named for the year of the first Olympics, when a cook from nearby village ended up winning the Stadion race. Ohanian&#8217;s idea with the name stems from the fact that the cook was likely a fantastic athlete, but not necessarily the <em>best </em>athlete out there; many people were excluded from the first Olympic games, from athletes outside of Greece to those who didn&#8217;t have the means to show up to women, who weren&#8217;t even allowed to watch the games.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I thought about that track record, and all the things that I&#8217;ve been proud of as an entrepreneur and investor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I was celebrating the cook,&#8221; said Ohanian. &#8220;I&#8217;m still very proud of that track record, but I know that I could have done better. I want the idea that we&#8217;re always on the first starting line trying to do better in pursuit of greater returns.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that this pursuit, to leave no entrepreneurial rock unturned, is not necessarily something he wants to do because he enjoys it and it feels good, but because &#8220;it will make more money, it&#8217;s more successful and more effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equity and inclusion, then, is built into the DNA of Seven Seven Six. Half of the firm&#8217;s limited partners are women, and 15 percent are black or indigenous people.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohanian, Katelyn Holloway and Lissie Garvin are taking founding positions at Seven Seven Six. Both worked with Ohanian at Initialized and Reddit.</p>
<p>One other unique piece of Seven Seven Six is that it is introducing a 2% &#8220;Growth and Caregiving Commitment.&#8221; Ohanian explained that, when he was going through Y Combinator, he was going through a rough time in his personal life. His mother was suffering from an illness, and his girlfriend (at the time) had been in an accident abroad.</p>
<p>So, as he was establishing a business, he was also traveling to see the people he loved who needed him. The financial burden added even more complexity to his life, and an incalculable level of stress.</p>
<p>The 2% commitment sets aside an extra two percent of an investment Seven Seven Six makes into a particular company, to offer financial support to founders for whatever they might need, from childcare to travel to surfing lessons, if that&#8217;s what it takes to help a founder perform in a healthy, balanced way.</p>
<p>Transparency is also a key part of Seven Seven Six&#8217;s philosophy. The firm plans to report on the spending out of this 2% commitment, as well as the diversity and inclusion breakdown of its investments each year.</p>
<p>Thus far, the VC firm has made 17 investments. From the release:</p>

<p>Seven Seven Six primarily wants to invest in seed rounds, and lead those rounds as much as possible. The fund joins a host of others that have raised this year as VCs continue to enjoy a low interest-rate environment that is helping bring cash to their investment firms.</p>

<p>The Intelligence Fund will provide seed and Series A funding to startups that already have venture capital funding, Recorded Future says, as well as equip them with resources to help with the development and integration of intelligence applications in order to accelerate their go-to-market strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future, which provides customers with information to help them better understand the external cyber threats they are facing, will invest in startups that aim to tackle significant problems that require novel approaches using datasets and collection platforms, which the company says could be anything from technical internet sensors to satellites. It’s also keen to invest in startups building intelligence analysis toolsets that make use of technologies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> and machine learning, as well as intelligence-driven applications that can be integrated into its own Intelligence Platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Recorded Future co-founder and chief executive Christopher Ahlberg said: “In a world of aggressive uncertainty, intelligence is the only equalizer. With the launch of the Intelligence Fund, we are investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs who share our vision for securing the world with intelligence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So far, the Intelligence Fund has invested in two companies, the first being SecurityTrails, which provides customers with a comprehensive overview of current and historical domain and IP address data. The second investment went to Gemini Advisory, a fraud intelligence platform specializing in finding compromised data on the dark web, which Recorded Future went on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-gemini-advisory-301248485.html">to acquire</a> earlier this year for $52 million in a bid to bolster its own threat intelligence capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future told TechCrunch that future investments could also be made with an eye to acquiring, but added that funding could also be given purely on the basis that the startup would make a good business or technology partner. Recorded Future was itself acquired by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/"> private equity firm Insight Partners back in 2019 for $780 million</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The acquisition effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought out the company&#8217;s earlier investors</a>, including Google&#8217;s venture arm GV, and In-Q-Tel, the non-profit venture arm of the U.S. intelligence community.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the fund, Michael Triplett, managing partner at Insight Partners, said: “Cyberattacks continue to impact global enterprises across the globe, and we’re excited to see Recorded Future invest in intelligence startups tackling the business-critical issues that organizations face today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Intelligence Fund will provide the resources needed by entrepreneurs to build applications with data and mathematics at the core.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic hit last year, <a href="http://punchbowl.com">Punchbowl</a>, an online party planning service was left in the lurch with gatherings all but shut down, but instead of lamenting the situation, founder and CEO Matt Douglas went to work to rethink the company&#8217;s approach. He started by expanding the company&#8217;s online greeting card business, which until that point had been a small part of the revenue mix. Then he began talking to investors about a cash influx with an eye toward adding video to the platform.</p>
<p>That all culminated in a slew of announcements today. For starters, the company pulled in $5 million from SG Credit Partners. Douglas then turned around and bought online video production service <a href="http://vidhug.com">VidHug</a> and rebranded it for his platform as <a href="https://www.memento.com/">Memento</a>. Finally, he invested in a couple of apps designed to draw new parents to the service early in their children&#8217;s lives. More on those shortly.</p>
<p>When the government made the no-gatherings rule official, Punchbowl needed a plan. &#8220;So we took our team and we put our energy towards a product that was less than 10% of our business prior to the pandemic and that is greeting cards,&#8221; Douglas said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He made the greeting cards more personalized by adding a video component. His team got that going pretty fast, putting it together by Mother&#8217;s Day 2020 to include a visual message at a time when people couldn&#8217;t get together in person. But he wanted something more than that, and he dove into researching the video montage market. That ultimately led to him connecting with the founders of VidHug and making an offer to buy the Canadian startup.</p>
<p>Memento helps you make and collect video clips, pull them together into a video and choose music and backgrounds in a friendly interface, putting basic video production within reach of of just about any user.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enter new markets and embrace a distributed workforce to grow during a pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/enter-new-markets-and-embrace-a-distributed-workforce-to-grow-during-a-pandemic/embed/#?secret=k31TX0Hlr8" data-secret="k31TX0Hlr8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Douglas sees adding video as more than a consumer play though. He believes with Memento, he can also attract business customers to use video &#8212; for example, as a way to welcome new employees, especially in distributed organizations, or to make a good-bye video for a long-time employee leaving the company, and in this way begin to expand the platform to include not only consumer customers, but businesses too.</p>
<p>While he was at it, he invested in some apps directed at new parents, particularly moms, including <a href="https://www.qeepsake.co/">Qeepsake</a> and <a href="https://www.pumpspotting.com/">pumpspotting</a>. Qeepsake is an app that prompts parents with a text to collect different memories of their children&#8217;s lives and then print them in a keep-sake book. It&#8217;s aimed at parents who never got around to making that baby book. Pumpspotting helps support breastfeeding moms, whether they are at home or work, and it also provides resources for their employers to support nursing moms as well.</p>
<p>He believes that by attracting parents at the earliest time in their childrens&#8217; lives, he can get them to use other Punchbowl services to plan birthday parties and other events, add video memories, and build long-term brand loyalty along the way.</p>
<p>Douglas has been at this since 2007 when he conceived and launched Punchbowl, and while he says he has had offers over the years to be acquired, he never wanted to sell. Although 2020 might have been the toughest year ever for his party planning business, he used the crisis to rethink it, and in the process may have built something that can survive and thrive longer term with a wider variety of services and revenue streams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over three months after its last funding round, European fintech giant </span><a href="http://klarna.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is announcing today that it has raised another $639 million at a staggering post-money valuation of $45.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumors swirled in recent weeks that Klarna had raised more money at a valuation north of $40 billion. But the Swedish </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy now, pay later behemoth and upstart bank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to comment until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the latest round, which also included participation from existing investors Adit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures, Honeycomb Asset Management and WestCap Group. The new valuation represents a 47.3% increase over Klarna’s post-money valuation of $31 billion</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early March</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it raised $1 billion, and a 330% increase over its $10.6 billion valuation at the time of its $650 million raise </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previous backers include Sequoia Capital, SilverLake, Dragoneer and Ant Group, among others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing cements 16-year-old Klarna’s position as the highest-valued private fintech in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Klarna CEO and founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the company has seen explosive growth in the U.S. and plans to use its new capital in part to continue to grow there and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, over the past year, the fintech has seen &#8220;massive momentum&#8221; in the country, with more than 18 million American consumers now using Klarna, he said. That’s up from 10 million at the end of last year’s third quarter, and up 118% year over year. Klarna is now live with 24 of the top 100 U.S. retailers, which it says is “more than any of its competitors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Klarna is live in 20 markets, has more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 90 million global active users and more than 2 million transactions a day conducted on its platform. The company’s momentum can be seen in its impressive financial results. In the first quarter, Klarna notched $18.1 billion in volume compared to $9.9 billion in the prior year first quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of 2020, it processed $53 billion in volume. To put that into context; Affirm’s financial report in May projected it would process $8.04 billion in volume for the entire fiscal year of 2021 and Afterpay is projecting $16 billion in volume for its entire fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2021 also represented a record month for global shopping volume with $6.9 billion of purchases made through the Klarna platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in 2020, Klarna hit over a billion in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company was profitable for its first 14 years of life, it has not been profitable the last two, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, and that’s been by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve scaled up so massively in investments in our growth and technology, but running on a loss is very odd for us,” he told TechCrunch. “We will get back to profitability soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has entered six new markets this year alone, including New Zealand and France, where it just launched this week. It is planning to expand into a number of new markets this year. The company has about 4,000 employees with several hundred in the U.S. in markets such as New York and Los Angeles. It also has offices in Stockholm, London, Manchester, Berlin, Madrid and Amsterdam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Klarna is partnered with over 250,000 retailers around the world (including Macy’s, Ikea, Nike, Saks), its buy now, pay later feature is also available direct to consumers via its shopping app. This means that consumers can use Klarna’s app to pay immediately or later, as well as manage spending and view available balances. They can also do things like initiate refunds, track deliveries and get price-drop notifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our shopping browser allows users to use Klarna everywhere,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one else is offering that, and are rather limited to integrating with merchants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other things the company plans to do with its new capital is focus on acquisitions, particularly acqui-hires, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski. According to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/klarna"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has made nine known acquisitions over time &#8212; most recently picking up Los Gatos-based content creation services provider Toplooks.ai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re the market leader in this space and we want to find new partners that want to support us in this,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski told TechCrunch. “That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives us better prerequisites to be successful going forward. Now we have more cash and money available to invest further in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has long been rumored to be going public via a direct listing. Siemiatkowski said that the company in many ways already acts like a public company in that it offers stock to all its employees, and reports financials &#8212; giving the impression that the company is not in a hurry to go the public route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We report quarterly to national authorities and are a fully regulated bank so do all the things you expect to see from public companies such as risk control and compliance,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re reaching a point for it to be a natural evolution for the company to IPO. But we’re not preparing to IPO anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its last funding round, Klarna announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GiveOne</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative to support planet health. With this round, the company is again giving 1% of the equity raised back to the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, its investors are bullish on what the company is doing and its market position. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, said the company’s growth</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded on a deep understanding of how the purchasing behaviors of consumers are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">changing,” an evolution SoftBank believes is only accelerating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Munson, founder and CIO of Adit Ventures, said his firm believes the “best is yet to come as Klarna multiplies their addressable market through global expansion.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, what Klarna is trying to achieve is to compete with the $1 trillion-plus credit card industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really see right now all the signs are there. True competition is coming to this space, this decade,” he said. “This is an opportunity to genuinely disrupt the retail banking space.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft will soon launch a dedicated device for game streaming, the company announced today. It&#8217;s also working with a number of TV manufacturers to build the Xbox experience right into their internet-connected screens and Microsoft plans to bring build cloud gaming to the PC Xbox app later this year, too, with a focus on play-before-you-buy scenarios.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what these new game streaming devices will look like. Microsoft didn&#8217;t provide any further details. But chances are, we&#8217;re talking about either a Chromecast-like streaming stick or a small Apple TV-like box. So far, we also don&#8217;t know which TV manufacturers it will partner with.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft is bullish about cloud gaming. With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, it&#8217;s already making it possible for its subscribers to play more than 100 console games on Android, streamed from the Azure cloud, for example. In a few weeks, it&#8217;ll open cloud gaming in the browser on Edge, Chrome and Safari, to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers (it&#8217;s currently in limited beta). And it is bringing Game Pass Ultimate to Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan later this year, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In many ways, Microsoft is unbundling gaming from the hardware &#8212; similar to what Google is trying with Stadia (an effort that, so far, has fallen flat for Google) and Amazon with Luna. The major advantage Microsoft has here is a large library of popular games, something that&#8217;s mostly missing on competing services, with the exception of Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce Now platform &#8212; though that one has a different business model since its focus is not on a subscription but on allowing you to play the games you buy in third-party stores like Steam or the Epic store.</p>
<p>What Microsoft clearly wants to do is expand the overall Xbox ecosystem, even if that means it sells fewer dedicated high-powered consoles. The company likens this to the music industry&#8217;s transition to cloud-powered services backed by all-you-can-eat subscription models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that games, that interactive entertainment, aren’t really about hardware and software. It’s not about pixels. It’s about people. Games bring people together,&#8221;<br />
said Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox head Phil Spencer. &#8220;Games build bridges and forge bonds, generating mutual empathy among people all over the world. Joy and community -that’s why we’re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft says it&#8217;s not doing away with dedicated hardware, though, and is already working on the next generation of its console hardware &#8212; but don&#8217;t expect a new Xbox console anytime soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world seems to move faster every year, and yet, nothing feels slower than the speed by which paychecks get distributed. In the United States, work conducted the day after a pay period will take two weeks just to process, with a check or direct deposit coming another week or two later. For the tens of millions of employees who live paycheck-to-paycheck, that multi-week delay can be the difference of making a rent check — or not.</p>
<p>A variety of startups have approached this problem with different solutions, and one of the newest and most compelling offerings is Clair.</p>
<p>Using its own base of capital, New York City-based <a href="https://getclair.com">Clair</a> offers instant — and most importantly — free earned wage advances to workers by integrating into existing HR technology platforms. It works with both full-time employees and also gig workers, and it offers a suite of online and mobile apps for workers to make sense of their finances and ask for an earned wage advance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 by CEO Nico Simko, COO Alex Kostecki and CPO Erich Nussbaumer, and today, the company announced that it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Kareem Zaki of Thrive Capital, who will join the company’s board of directors. Just a few months ago, Clair had announced a $4.5 million seed round led by Upfront Ventures, bringing its total funding to $19.5 million.</p>
<p>“Pay advance” or “earned wage advance” (there is a slight distinction) have been the Silicon Valley euphemism for payday loan, an industry that has been plagued with allegations of fraud, deceit and rapacious greed that have bilked workers out of their hard-earned paychecks through usurious interest rates.</p>
<p>What sets Clair apart is that its offering is free to workers. Since it connects directly into HR systems, the startup takes on significantly less financial risk than traditional payday lenders, who don’t have access to the payroll data that Clair is able to analyze.</p>
<p>For Simko, one of his goals is simply to see the elimination of the traditional industry entirely. “I have a payday lender just in front of my apartment in Brooklyn and there is a long line on the 25th of every month, and I am not going to stop until that line disappears,” he said. “Success for us is just to become the winner in earned wage access.”</p>
<p>He is Argentine-Swiss, and came to the States to attend Harvard, where he met Nussbaumer. He ended up working at J.P. Morgan focused on the payments market. He stayed in touch with Kostecki, whose families are good friends, and the Swiss trio decided to go after this problem, partly inspired by Uber’s instant pay feature that it introduced in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/ubers-instant-pay-has-cashed-out-1-3b-to-drivers-in-just-one-year/">which proved wildly successful</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164223" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164223" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders-Jan-2020.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164223" class="wp-caption-text">Clair founders Alex Kostecki, Nico Simko, Erich Nussbaumer. Image Credits: Clair</p></div></p>
<p>Instead of making money on interest rates, fees, or tips, Clair instead wants to be the bank and financial service provider of choice for workers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/coatue-direct-deposits-20m-into-pinwheel-a-payroll-api-for-neobanks/">As I noted last week about Pinwheel</a>, an API platform for payroll, owning the direct deposit relationship with a worker all but guarantees they will conduct the vast majority of their financial transactions through that particular bank account.</p>
<p>Clair offers free instant pay advances as a gateway to its other offerings, which include spending and savings accounts, a debit card, a virtual in-app debit card, and financial planning tools. Simko said, “Our business model is to give earned wage access free for people and then sign them up automatically for a digital bank, and then we make money the same way Chime makes money, which is interchange fees.”</p>
<p>In fact, he and the company believe in that model so much, it will actually pay human capital technology platforms like workforce management and payroll systems to integrate with Clair as an inducement. It offers a recurring revenue fee stream for HR tools based on the number of users who join Clair, regardless of how much those workers use the software. We are “really going down the thesis of embedded fintech,” Simko said. “Employees start spending money on their Clair card, and we distribute that back to our [HR tech] partners.”</p>
<p>Clair joins a number of other companies in this space, which is becoming ever more heated as the perceived opportunity in financial services remains high among investors. Last year, payroll platform Gusto announced that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/">expand from purely payroll to a financial wellness platform</a>, which is partially based on its instant earned wage advances or what it dubs Cashout. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/">We’ve covered Even</a>, which is one of the originals in this space with a major partnership with Walmart, as well as neobank Dave, which offers pay advance features with a tipping revenue model. Dave just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/mark-cuban-backed-banking-app-dave-going-public-via-4-billion-spac.html">announced a $4 billion valued SPAC with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Clair’s angle is differentiated as the race to lock in every person globally with new financial services heats up. Simko says he sees a gargantuan opportunity to be the “Alipay” of the United States, noting that unlike China with Alipay, Nubank in Brazil and increasingly Latin America, and N26 and Revolut in Europe, there is still an opportunity for a comprehensive neobank to take over the U.S. market.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company will continue to expand its product offerings, exploring areas like health care and debt repayment. “I can give APR not based on their credit score but on their employer’s credit score, which is the multi-billion dollar idea here,” Simko said. The team is nominally hubbed in New York with roughly half of the 25 or so person team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring sales tax specialist TaxJar in April</a>, today Stripe is making another big move in the area of tax. The $95 billion payments behemoth is launching a new product called Stripe Tax, which will provide automatic, updated sales tax calculations (covering sales tax, VAT, and GST) and related accounting services to Stripe payments customers initially in some 30 countries and across the U.S.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax is a separate service from TaxJar, but the two are not unconnected: as Stripe Tax was being built out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/04/stripe-will-establish-an-engineering-hub-in-dublin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe&#8217;s offices in Dublin</a> over the last several months, Stripe&#8217;s business lead for EMEA Matt Henderson told me that the team had identified TaxJar as a strong company in the field, and that ultimately led to M&amp;A between them.</p>
<p>Sales tax &#8212; and specifically a more seamless way to deal with charging and tracking sales tax &#8212; is a painful issue for people doing business online. Digital and physical goods are taxed in over 130 countries, Stripe said, and within that there can be a huge amount of variation and compliance complexity, since codes get updated all the time, too. Mishandled sales tax, meanwhile, can result in pretty hefty fines, sometimes up to 30% interest on past-due amounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a sales tax tool has been the most requested feature from Stripe&#8217;s customers, Henderson said, a request that presumably only got louder in the last year, as e-commerce and digital transactions went through the roof with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Arguably, that makes Stripe Tax one of the company&#8217;s more significant product launches, not to mention the first since announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monster funding round earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, Stripe customers would have resorted to using a third-party service (like TaxJar) to work out sales tax, or more typically those Stripe customers would have opted to limit the number of places they sold goods and services, in order to minimize the pain of dealing with multiple, complex, and usually quite localized tax codes.</p>
<p>Stripe said that a survey of its customers found that two-thirds of respondents said that the challenge of implementing sales tax actually limited their growth.</p>
<p>TaxJar has built a strong system for handling that, but the company &#8212; based out of Massachusetts &#8212; is primarily focused on the U.S. market, which has sales tax that is complicated enough (there are 11,000 different tax jurisdictions in the country).</p>
<p>That leaves a lot on the table for building out sales tax tools for the rest of the world: the wider geographical focus of Stripe Tax thus fills a particular geographical gap for the company, regardless of how well TaxJar and Stripe integrate over time.</p>
<p>There are some other differences worth noting between the two.</p>
<p>TaxJar came to Stripe&#8217;s attention with an established business &#8212; 15,000 customers at the time of the announcement. Stripe (wisely) bolted that on as a standalone business, so new and existing customers that use TaxJar can continue to use it as is. That is to say, at least for now, they do not need to be Stripe payments customers in order to use TaxJar, even if the integration between the two platforms will only improve over time.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax, on the other hand, is being built from the ground up as a product aimed specifically at increasing touchpoints and stickiness with Stripe customers specifically.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax provides real-time tax calculation based on customer location and product sold; transparent itemizing for customers; tax ID management in areas (like Europe) where business customers can provide their code and get a reverse charge on tax if they are under a certain turnover threshold themselves; and reconciliation and reporting across all transactions to make filing and remittance easier.</p>
<p>But, there is for now no way to use Stripe Tax outside of Stripe itself.</p>
<p>This could pose some problems for some customers &#8212; these days many of the strongest retailers will take an &#8216;omnichannel&#8217; approach that might cover selling through marketplaces, selling through websites, selling through social media and more &#8212; and not all of those storefronts might be powered by Stripe. It will be worth watching whether future iterations of Stripe Tax can account for that.</p>
<p>“No one leaps out of bed in the morning excited to deal with taxes,” said John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe in a statement. “For most businesses, managing tax compliance is a painful distraction. We simplify everything about calculating and collecting sales taxes, VAT, and GST, so our users can focus on building their businesses.”</p>
<p>Stripe&#8217; most significant product launch prior to Stripe Tax &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Treasury</a> &#8212; underscores how the company is currently very focused on diversifying outside of their basic payments business and opening the platform to much wider, more scaled transactions. Treasury, which is still in invite-only mode, saw Stripe partner with established banks to provide a business banking service, providing a way for its customers to handle money that they generate from their Stripe-powered businesses.</p>
<p>The full country list where Stripe Tax is launching is Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the early detection and treatment of health conditions, easy access to primary healthcare is crucial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary healthcare is best delivered by teams of primary care clinicians coordinating care between them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ubiquitous access to such care is scant across Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real opportunity for digital healthcare platforms to scale access to team-based care across the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can reduce the cost of quality care while improving health outcomes, reach patients in remote areas and reduce the pressure on the traditional medical support systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has seen such platforms scale globally, and Africa is not exempt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new platform (without a name yet) is launching out of South Africa and it wants to provide accessible quality care for Africans with its telehealth service. Today, it has closed a $3 million pre-Series A round to that end</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you&#8217;re wondering why the platform doesn&#8217;t have a name (I am too), but what&#8217;s interesting is the fact that a VC firm (Webrock Ventures) and two health tech companies (Healthforce.io and Doktor.se) joined forces to launch this new venture</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s summarized information on the trio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://webrockventures.com/en/">Webrock Ventures</a> is a Sweden-based investment company that employs a venture-building model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm partners with tech companies in Sweden and combines its cash with the company&#8217;s business models to create portfolio businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It does this while maintaining a sizeable stake in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://healthforce.io/">Healthforce</a> is a South Africa-based health tech company that tries to improve healthcare through multidisciplinary clinical teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has set up nurses in over 450 clinics across the country while conducting more than 1 million nurse consultations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthforce also has a telemedicine play with over 110,000 consultations since launching the service last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Sweden-based telehealth company, <a href="https://doktor.se/">Doktor.se</a> allows patients to contact healthcare professionals through their smartphones across the whole spectrum of primary care</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most of its customers are in Europe, as well as in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why form a partnership to launch a telehealth product in South Africa with a plan for further roll-out in other African countries down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, telehealth investments have skyrocketed and increased by more than 50% since the start of the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of the fastest-growing economies globally, investors and companies (in this case, Webrock and Doktor.se) are now turning to Africa as a major growth region for such high-demand services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Doktor.se has two models for commercialising its telemedicine application. The first is to use its technology to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver healthcare services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second model licenses the core technology to third parties in markets in which Doktor.se has no intention of expanding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doktor.se achieved this with Brazilian health tech startup ViBe Saúde (via Webrock), and last year, the platform had over 1.2 million patient consultations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to do the same by licensing its technology to deliver care through Healthforce across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By forming a new partnership, a completely new opportunity is set up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthforce can leverage its current position to take core tech from Doktor.se to a new direct-to-patient market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the background is Webrock, a willing investment machine set up to scale the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new venture will focus on the uninsured, B2C segment through a freemium-type offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers on-demand and scheduled consultations with nurses, general practitioners and mental health professionals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides chronic care management and will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be integrated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Healthforce’s broader primary care offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/saulkornik">Saul Kornik</a>, co-founder and CEO at Healthforce, will resume a new role at the newly formed company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, the partnership gives Healthforce an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product to add to its healthcare product stack</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it gives Doktor.se the ability to generate license fee revenue from a new market, while Webrock has an opportunity to invest in yet another large developing market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Webrock and Healthforce partnered to bring funding and strategic/operational capacity to this new pan-African direct-to-patient play, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;All existing independent operations will continue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, under the NewCo, Healthforce as a major shareholder will expand its primary care product stack and Doktor.se will generate revenue off license fees earned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sub-Saharan Africa has a healthcare market of about $90 billion. But health insurance coverage is in single-digit (percentage-wise) across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa except for South Africa with 16% coverage. Kornik says the three parties want to tackle a large portion of this challenge and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the healthcare system in Africa could look if it were functioning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a pure-play provider-of-healthcare venture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this pan-African venture, we will deliver high-quality healthcare at low cost to 75 million people through telemedicine, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting healthcare in the palm of their hands,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner at Webrock Ventures <a href="https://webrockventures.com/en/about/team/#:~:text=Joshin%20Raghubar&amp;text=He%20is%20the%20founder%20of,and%20a%20Yale%20World%20Fellow.">Joshin Raghubar</a> and co-founder and CEO of Doktor, <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/martin-lindman-304b4438">Martin Lindman</a>, are enthusiastic about the opportunity Africa presents due to its large population and increasing smartphone penetration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>This new venture, which should hopefully have a name soon, is one of the few health tech platforms based in South Africa that have raised seven-figure sums in a fintech-dominated year. In February, <a href="https://hearxgroup.com/">hearX Group, a company that specializes in making hearing healthcare technologies</a>, raised $8.3 million Series A to expand into the U.S. April saw Quro Medical <a href="https://www.quromedical.co.za/">close a $1.1 million seed round</a> to scale its service that manages ill patients in the comfort of their homes. Judging by the spacing between each fundraise, we should see more from the country before the year runs out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eightfold AI, a startup which uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/two-facebook-and-google-geniuses-are-combining-search-and-ai-to-transform-hr/">help companies find, recruit and retain workers</a>, said on Thursday it has raised $220 million in a new round as it looks to accelerate its growth.</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the Series E round of the five-year-old startup, which is now valued at $2.1 billion, up from $1 billion in Series E last October, <a href="http://eightfold.ai">Eightfold AI</a> founder and chief executive <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutoshgarg893/">Ashutosh Garg</a> told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Existing investors General Catalyst, Capital One Ventures, Foundation Capital, IVP and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated in the new round, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $410 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Mountain View-based startup provides its clients with a talent acquisition platform that helps them identify suitable candidates and import and filter thousands of resumes. One of Eightfold AI&#8217;s missions is to help companies reduce biases in their hirings, so it masks candidates&#8217; personal information during evaluation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of searching for a job, a candidate can upload their resume and the system will tell the most relevant job for that candidate in real-time,&#8221; explained Garg. &#8220;What this does is, it reduces the drop-off rate. And our clients see more applications &#8212; and field more diverse applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which has amassed clients in over 100 countries and offers its platform in over a dozen languages, also enables employers to deploy the Eightfold platform internally and help employees discover promotions and new role opportunities within their organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has helped businesses almost double their internal mobility,&#8221; said Garg, who previously worked at IBM Research, where he filed patents on understanding people behavior, and Google, where he worked on the company&#8217;s user personalization efforts.</p>
<p>Recruiting remains a big global problem and an untapped opportunity. Garg said solving this requires expertise with sifting through a plethora of data points and right talent. Eightfold itself analyzes data it sources from a range of places including employers&#8217; sales, customer management and human resources as well as public sources such as patent sites and publications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transforming HR and global talent further unlocks trillions of dollars&#8217; worth of human potential. SoftBank shares our bold vision, and we are excited to welcome them as our partner,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the state of Indiana, Eightfold maintains partnership for people applying for unemployment insurance to build up their resumes and find job opportunities instantly. The startup also has a program for veterans in the U.S. to help them find opportunities relevant to their skills, said Garg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by AI and machine learning, Eightfold&#8217;s platform provides global enterprises with a single solution for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including hiring, retaining, and growing a diverse global workforce,&#8221; said Deep Nishar, Senior Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and who previously worked for nearly six years at LinkedIn. &#8220;We are pleased to partner with Ashutosh and the Eightfold team to support their ambition of transforming how enterprises manage talent and how people build their careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eightfold will deploy the fresh capital to accelerate its expansion efforts and invest in hiring more data scientists and engineers, Garg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://osome.com/">Osome</a>, a startup that combines multiple corporate services for SMEs into one “super app,” has raised a $16 million Series A. The round included returning investors Target Global, AltaIR Capital and Phystech Ventures, and new backers S16VC and venture capitalist Peng T. Ong, who joined as an angel investor.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based startup’s last funding round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/singapore-based-digital-business-assistant-osome-raises-3-million/">$3 million announced in November</a>. Its Series A brings Osome’s total funding since it was founded in 2017 to $24.5 million. It now claims to be used by 6,000 companies in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, giving it $9.5 million in annual recurring revenue and 100% year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>Its Series A will be used on international expansion and product integrations. Osome, which employs a total of 200 people, has seen fast adoption by e-commerce companies in particular, and plans to launch more products and apps for the sector over the next 18 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based digital business assistant Osome raises $3 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/singapore-based-digital-business-assistant-osome-raises-3-million/embed/#?secret=sAhuCxOBjE" data-secret="sAhuCxOBjE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Victor Lysenko told TechCrunch that the company started “looking at the e-commerce segment some time ago, but wanted to be confident that our product can handle the increased complexity and transaction volume of e-commerce businesses before launching marketing. The pandemic has caused the e-commerce industry to grow significantly faster and that was also a factor for us.”</p>
<p>He added that Osome will add integrations with multiple e-commerce platforms and administrative services, with the goal of cutting hours out of the time e-commerce company owners spend on accounting each week.</p>
<p>Osome’s flagship product is online accounting services for SMEs, connecting companies with chartered accountants. It also offers corporate secretary services, including business registration, compliance and taxation. The platform uses machine learning tech to automate many tasks—for example, it categorizes, tags and stores documents, creates management reports and tax returns and files paperwork on time.</p>
<p>Lysenko said entrepreneurs on average spend 68% of their time dealing with back-office tasks, instead of strategizing their company’s goals. Osome is meant to reduce the burden of administrative work on small businesses and demand for its services grew during the pandemic as companies moved more of their operations online.</p>
<p>Singapore makes it relatively easy to incorporate businesses online, so several other startups in the same space are based there. These include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/sleek/">Sleek</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lanturn-a-singaporean-tech-enabled-corporate-services-provider-raises-3-million-seed-round/">Lanturn</a> and BlueMeg, all focused on automating accounting and other time-consuming tasks for SMEs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, S16VC co-founder Aleks Shamis said, “I’ve done business with small and medium e-commerce in 10 countries and see the same inefficiencies in manual accounting across all of them. It is a real problem that will definitely be solved, and Osome is technologically and traction-wise among the few companies in the world in getting there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two profound problems face the higher education sector globally &#8212; affordability and relevance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you live in Africa, Europe, or the U.S., a major reason why people don&#8217;t go to university or college or even drop out because they cannot afford tuition fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, relevance shows the huge gap between what traditional universities teach and what global employers actually look for. It&#8217;s not a secret that universities focus a bit too much on theory.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, there has been the emergence of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alternative credential providers trying to provide students with the necessary skills to earn and make a living. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University is one of such platforms, and today, it has a closed $10.8 million pre-Series A funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubai-based VC Global Ventures led the new round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Future Africa&#8217;s new thematic fund (focused on education), angel investors, and family offices. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unnamed VCs from 10 countries, including the U.S., U.K., France, Dubai, Switzerland, Qatar, Nigeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, also took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Nexford has raised $15.3 million, following the first tranche of $4.5 million in seed funding raised two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ftarzi">Fadl Al Tarzi</a> launched <a href="https://www.nexford.org/">Nexford University</a> in 2019. The tech-enabled university is filling affordability and relevance gaps by providing access to quality and affordable education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That way, you get the best of both worlds,&#8221; CEO Al Tarzi said to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You get practical skills that you can put to work immediately or for your future career while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping a job</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the whole experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a learning as a service model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford Unversity lets students study at their own pace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they apply and get admitted into either a degree program or a course program, they choose how fast or slow they want the program to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says whatever students learn on the platform is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applicable to their jobs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently, Nexford offers undergraduate degrees in business administration; 360</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing; AI &amp; automation; building a tech startup; business analytics; business in emerging markets; digital transformation; e-commerce; and product management. Its graduate degrees are business administration, advanced AI, e-commerce, hyperconnectivity, sustainability, and world business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford&#8217;s tuition structure is very different from traditional universities because it&#8217;s modelled monthly. Its accredited degrees cost between $3,000 to $4,000 paid in monthly instalments. In Nigeria, for instance, an MBA costs about $160 a month, while a bachelor degree costs $80 a month. But the catch for the monthly instalment structure means the faster a learner graduates, the less they pay.</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s it like learning with Nexford University?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University doesn&#8217;t offer standardized and theoretical tests or assignments as most traditional universities do. Al Tarzi says the company employs what he calls a competency-based education model where students prove mastery by working on practical projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a student working on an accounting course will most likely need to create a P&amp;L statement, analyze balance sheets and identify where the error is to correct it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform then gives the student different scenarios showing companies with different revenues and expense levels. The task? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To analyse and extract certain ratios to help make sense of which company is profitable and the other unit economics involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Nexford plays in the edtech space, Al Tarzi doesn&#8217;t think the company is an edtech company. As a licensed and accredited online university, Nexford has a huge amount of automation across the organization and provides students with support from faculty and career advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After offering degrees, Nexford puts on its placement hats by fixing its graduates with partner employers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a big shortage of jobs in Nigeria, and despite the high unemployment, it&#8217;s actually difficult to find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> qualified entry-level graduates. So Nexford has carried out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnerships where employers sponsor their employees or soon-to-be employees for upskilling and rescaling purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An illustration is with Sterling Bank, a local bank in the country. Most Nigerian banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have yearly routines where they hire graduates and put them on weeks-long training programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sterling Bank employs any candidate it feels did great after</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the capital intensive (eight weeks in most cases) programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what Nexford has done is to partner with Sterling to fund the tuition for high school leavers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When these students go through Nexford&#8217;s programs for the first year, they begin to get part-time placements at Sterling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Upon graduation, they get a job in the bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That saves Sterling the training cost and our tuition fee is almost equal to the training that they provided for students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, students start paying back once they get placed, so it&#8217;s a win-win.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164263 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png 1349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=768,328 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University has learners from 70 countries, with Nigeria its biggest market yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nexford also has blue-chip partnerships with Microsoft, LinkedIn Learning, and IBM </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide access to tools, courses and programmes to improve the learning experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major gains of this learning experience is how it prepares people for remote jobs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford is bullish on its virtual skills grid, where people will get jobs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regardless of their location on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Across Sub Saharan Africa by the year 2026, there&#8217;s gonna be a shortage of about 100 million university seats as a result of huge growth in youth population not met by growth and supply. Even if you want to build universities fast, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to meet the demand. And that spirals down to the job market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the local economy will produce enough jobs in Nigeria, for instance. But we want to enable people to get remote jobs across the world and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have to migrate.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Nexford&#8217;s revenues grew by 300%. This year, the company hopes to triple the size of its enrollment from last year, the CEO said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford is big on designing students&#8217; curriculum based on analysis of what their employer needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Al Tarzi tells me that the company always follow the Big Data approach, asking themselves, &#8220;how do we find out what employers worldwide are looking for and keep our curriculum alive and relevant?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We develop proprietary technology that enables us to analyze job vacancies as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other data sources; use AI to understand how those data sets and build a curriculum based on those findings. So, in short, we start with the end in mind,&#8221; he answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is keen on improving its technology regardless. It wants to analyse skills more accurately and automate more functions to enhance user experience. That&#8217;s what the funding will be used for in addition to fuelling its regional expansion plans (particularly in Asia) and investing in growth and product development. Per the latter,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the online university says it will be launching partner programs with more employers globally to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both placement and upskilling and rescaling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merging both worlds of tech and the traditional university model is no easy feat. The former is about efficiency, user-centricity, product, among others. The latter embodies rigidity and continues to lag behind fast-paced innovation. And while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s been a boom in edtech, most startups try to circumvent the industry&#8217;s bureaucracy by launching an app or a MOOC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nexford&#8217;s model of running a degree-granting, licensed, accredited, and regulated university is more challenging but in it lies so much opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eaboyeji">Iyin Aboyeji</a>, Future Africa general partner CEO, understands this. It&#8217;s one reason why the company is the first investment out of Future Africa&#8217;s soon-to-be-launched fund focused on the future of learning and why he believes the company is a game-changer for higher education in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, while many universities in Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were shut</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down due to labour disputes, Nexford was already delivering an innovative and affordable new model of online higher education designed for a skills-based economy.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For general partner at Global Ventures <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/noor-sweid-4b5233">Noor Sweid</a>, Nexford University is redressing the mismatch between the supply of talent and the demands of today&#8217;s digital economy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with Fadl and the Nexford team on their journey toward expanding access to universal quality higher education in emerging markets,” she said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://yousign.com">Yousign</a> has raised a $36.6 million Series A funding round (€30 million). <a href="https://leadedge.com">Lead Edge Capital</a> is leading the round and eFounders is investing once again in the company. Yousign, as the name suggests, is an e-signature provider that complies with European regulation on digital signatures.</p>
<p>While the company was originally founded in 2013, Yousign teamed up with startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> in 2019. Following this deal, eFounders has become a key shareholders and a strategic partner.</p>
<p>Things have changed quite a lot since then as the e-signature market has grown tremendously. You may be familiar with DocuSign, Adobe Sign, SignNow, HelloSign and a bunch of other players. But none of them have been designed for the European market from the ground up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yousign wants to become the European alternative to these American companies. More specifically, the startup thinks it can convince small and medium companies that aren’t using an e-signature solution yet. Instead of asking DocuSign customers to switch, Yousign wants to convert new customers to e-signatures.</p>
<p>“Faced with American giants with large scopes and complex products, we have built a solution that is accessible and easy to use, allowing SMBs to sign their first documents within the hour, and not a month” Yousign co-founder and CEO Luc Pallavidino said in a statement.</p>
<p>Yousign is a certification authority and complies with eIDAS — a European framework for e-signatures. It means that signatures are legally binding and the service archives your documents in partnership with <a href="https://arkhineo.com">Arkhineo</a>.</p>
<p>Like other e-signature services, you can create document templates, approval workflows and reminders. Yousign makes sure the right person is signing the document with strong authentication processes and all events are timestamped. It’s a SaaS product, which means you have to pay a subscription fee to access the service.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Yousign wants to reach 50,000 European SMBs by 2024 — it has 6,000 clients today. That would represent an annual recurring revenue of $85 million (€70 million). In 2020 alone, the company grew drastically from 35 to 120 employees. The startup now plans to hire 150 additional employees over the next 18 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tata Digital, the subsidiary of Tata Sons, said on Thursday it is acquiring a majority stake in digital health startup 1mg, the latest in a series of investments as the salt-to-steel Indian conglomerate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/tata-digital-to-invest-75-million-in-curefit/">enters the digital consumer space</a>.</p>
<p>The firms didn&#8217;t share the financial details of the deal, but a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that 1mg has received over $220 million in primary and secondary investments &#8212; with participation from some existing investors &#8212; and is being valued at around $450 million. Tata Digital has acquired about 55% stake in the Indian startup, the person said, requesting anonymity as the specifics of the deal are private.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Tata Digital declined to comment. 1mg didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to insight firm Tracxn, 1mg had raised $156 million prior to Thursday&#8217;s announcement and was last valued at $242 million. 1mg counts Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Sequoia Capital India among its investors.</p>
<p>1mg is one of the largest players in the health space in India, where it competes with Prosus Ventures-backed PharmEasy, which leads the market. 1mg operates diagnostics labs, has a supply chain that covers over 20,000 Indian zipcodes, and is a major business-to-business distributor of medicines in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>Tata Digital said its investment in 1mg is in line with the giant&#8217;s &#8220;vision of creating a digital ecosystem which addresses the consumer needs across categories in a unified manner.&#8221; The giant, which announced plans to invest in fitness startup CureFit earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tata-group-reaches-agreement-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bigbasket/">acquired a majority stake in online grocer BigBasket</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to join hands with one of India&#8217;s most iconic and respected conglomerates,&#8221; said Prashant Tandon, co-founder and chief executive of 1mg, in a statement. &#8220;This marks a significant milestone in 1mg&#8217;s journey to make high quality healthcare products and services accessible to customers across India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tata, which owns consumer brands including Tata Tea, Tetley, Vitax, Eight O’Clock Coffee, Himalayan Natural Mineral Water, Tata Coffee Grand and Joekels, reaches over 200 million households in India and has an &#8220;unparalleled ability to leverage the Tata brand in consumer products,&#8221; wrote analysts at HDFC Bank last month.</p>

<p>Internet of Things devices are proliferating, making daily tasks more convenient for many people—but that comes at cost. The United Nations expects the amount of e-waste created globally <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/the-internet-of-trash-iot-has-a-looming-ewaste-problem">to reach 52.2 million metric tons</a> this year, and a sizable portion of that are dead batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://dracula-technologies.com/">Dracula Technologies</a>, a French startup that is currently <a href="https://virtual.computextaipei.com.tw/index">exhibiting virtually at Computex</a>, wants to help with its inkjet-printed organic photovoltaic (OPV, or organic solar cells) technology. Called LAYER (or Light As Your Energetic Response), Dracula Technologies’ OPV modules run indoors on natural or artificial ambient light, and can be used to power low-consumption indoor devices. Because they are printed and not made of silicon, the OPV modules&#8217; shape is more customizable and, unlike many batteries, it does not use rare earths or heavy metals. Instead, the modules are created from carbon-based material.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to being better for the environment, LAYER is also more economical—the company claims it can reduce the total cost of ownership by four times compared to batteries.</p>

<p>Dracula Technologies is currently working with manufacturers, including a partnership with Japanese semiconductor company Renesas Electronics and AND Technology Research (ANDtr) to <a href="https://andtr.com/renesas-electronics-and-dracula-technologies-press-release">create a self-powering, battery-less IoT device</a> that can send messages through BLE to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Dracula Technologies was founded in 2011, after a project in collaboration with the CEA (Commissariat à l&#8217;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives, or the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), a public research organization. Chief executive officer Brice Cruchon saw the tech’s commercial potential and after six years of research and development, LAYER was launched through the <a href="https://hello-tomorrow.org/">Hello Tomorrow program</a> for deep tech startups</p>
<p>So far, Dracula Technologies has raised a total of 4.4 million euros (about $5.4 million USD), including a 2 million euros round in 2016 from angel investors for a pilot line, and 2.4 million euros raised last year from MGI Digital and ISRA Cards, which Dracula Technologies is using to increase the production of its photovoltaic modules during its pre-industrialization stage. The company plans to move to its industrial phase in 2024, with the goal of producing millions of modules per year.</p>
<p>MGI Digital, a digital printing and finishing tech company, and ISRA Cards, which makes high-value electronic cards (like licenses or gift and loyalty cards), are Dracula Technologies’ industrial partners. It is also part of the Solar Impulse Foundation’s #1000 Solutions, a guide to green energy solutions that can be implemented on a large scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bukuwarung.com/">BukuWarung</a>, a fintech focused on Indonesia’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), announced today it has raised a $60 million Series A. The oversubscribed round was led by Valar Ventures, marking the firm’s first investment in Indonesia, and Goodwater Capital. The Jakarta-based startup claims this is the largest Series A round ever raised by a startup focused on services for MSMEs. BukuWarung did not disclose its valuation, but sources tell TechCrunch it is estimated to be between $225 million to $250 million.</p>
<p>Other participants included returning backers and angel investors like Aldi Haryopratomo, former chief executive officer of payment gateway GoPay, Klarna co-founder Victor Jacobsson and partners from SoftBank and Trihill Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, BukuWarung’s target market is the more than 60 million MSMEs in Indonesia, <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/67ce6854-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/67ce6854-en">according to data</a> from the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs. These businesses <a href="https://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/presscenter/articles/2021/MSMEs-bear-the-brunt.html">contribute</a> about 61% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product and employ 97% of its workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BukuWarung’s services, including digital payments, inventory management, bulk transactions and a Shopify-like e-commerce platform called Tokoko, are designed to digitize merchants that previously did most of their business offline (many of its clients started taking online orders during the COVID-19 pandemic). It is building what it describes as an “operating system” for MSMEs and currently claims more than 6.5 million registered merchant in 750 Indonesian cities, with most in Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. It says it has processed about $1.4 billion in annualized payments so far, and is on track to process over $10 billion in annualized payments by 2022.</p>
<p>BukuWarung’s new round brings its total funding to $80 million. The company says its growth in users and payment volumes has been capital efficient, and that more than 90% of its funds raised have not been spent. It plans to add more MSME-focused financial services, including lending, savings and insurance, to its platform.</p>

<p>BukuWarung’s new funding announcement comes four months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bukuwarung-a-startup-digitizing-indonesias-smes-raises-new-funding-from-rocketship-vc/">previous one</a>, and less than a month after competitor BukuKas disclosed it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">raised a $50 million Series B.</a> Both started out as digital bookkeeping apps for MSMEs before expanding into financial services and e-commerce tools.</p>
<p>When asked how BukuWarung plans to continue differentiating from BukuKas, co-founder and CEO Abhinay Peddisetty told TechCrunch, “We don’t see this space as a winner takes all, our focus is on building the best products for MSMEs as proven by our execution on our payments and accounting, shown by massive growth in payments TPV as we’re 10x bigger than the nearest player in this space.”</p>
<p>He added, “We have already run successful lending experiments with partners in fintech and banks and are on track to monetize our merchants backed by our deep payments, accounting and other data that we collect.”</p>
<p>BukuWarung’s new funding will be used to double its current workforce of 150, located in Indonesia, Singapore and India, to 300 and develop BukuWarung’s accounting, digital payments and commerce products, including a payments infrastructure that will include QR payments and other services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, the $4 billion joint venture between Aptiv and Hyundai, is exploring the company&#8217;s potential involvement in autonomous trucking or logistics, its CEO said today during a live session at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/autonomous-vehicle-pioneers-karl-iagnemma-and-chris-urmson-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TechCrunch&#8217;s 2021 Mobility Event</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of what&#8217;s on the other side of the coin is that the same core technology can of course apply to multiple use cases,&#8221; said Karl Iagnemma on the panel led by TechCrunch transportation editor Kirsten Korosec, who asked about Motional&#8217;s intention to expand its business model into trucking. &#8220;It&#8217;s similar, it&#8217;s not the same, but it&#8217;s similar. And so we are actively exploring other use cases. We will have additional activity in this area. We don&#8217;t have anything to announce today. But more to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Motional still believes the biggest economic opportunity comes from solving the hard technological problems of autonomy in the service of moving people, AKA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">the robotaxi model</a>, Iagnemma recognized the same hard problems &#8212; perception, planning, decision making, localization &#8212; lie at the core of autonomy, whether that&#8217;s moving people or parcels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for a great business opportunity that has the closest adjacency from a technical perspective to the stack that we&#8217;re currently developing,&#8221; said Iagnemma, responding to what is most appealing in the delivery and logistics model. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what it boils down to. These different use cases have, in some cases, quite dramatically different business cases around them, the opportunity looks quite different. And so that helps us score rank order internally. What presents an interesting opportunity? And then again, we tried to align that toward our current technology development path to say, hey, this would be the least incremental effort for the biggest incremental opportunity. That&#8217;s how we sort of guide our strategy, internally at Motional.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his part, Chris Urmson, co-founder and CEO of autonomous vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">Aurora</a>, and the other panelist on the session, admitted that ride-hailing and moving people with automated vehicles will ultimately be both a transformational business and one that surpasses trucking in the long term. Aurora is currently focused on freight applications, rather than robotaxi, for a number of reasons, including the ability to scale now.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/embed/#?secret=HsDjj73joF" data-secret="HsDjj73joF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;[The robotaxi] market will take time to evolve, whereas the freight and trucking market is here today,&#8221; said Urmson.</p>
<p>Both panelists agreed that there&#8217;s no low-hanging fruit in the autonomous world. The problem of self-driving vehicles is difficult to solve, but Urmson argues it&#8217;s perhaps a bit easier to solve with trucking, where you don&#8217;t have to reckon with the amount of variability in the road network of a city. Building an autonomous stack to drive on freeways is easier due to their mostly uniform nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;So once you crack the initial nut of having the technology working in that operational defined design domain, the rollout moves from a technological expansion to an operational expansion,&#8221; said Urmson. &#8220;And that looks more like kind of a conventional business. So we think that’s a way to be scaling the business and operations and generating the revenue stream that allows us to then go and really take that core technology and apply it into ride hailing and build an exciting business in that space as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community has never felt louder in startupland. Bringing people together over a shared interest is innate to human nature, and coming out of a lonely, draining pandemic, every startup is looking to cultivate community, conversation and camaraderie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, though, the outside world got a look at how Y Combinator, one of Silicon Valley’s most famed and feared accelerators, deals with the intricacies of a scaled, yet still ultra-exclusive, community after the accelerator kicked out two founders from its internal messaging board, Bookface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two founders,</span><a href="https://darklang.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO</span><a href="https://twitter.com/paulbiggar"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Biggar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.prolific.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prolific</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and co-founder</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ekadamer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Katia Damer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, say they were removed from YC after publicly critiquing YC &#8212; for very different reasons. Biggar had noted on social media back in March that another YC founder was tipping off people on how to cut the vaccine lines to get an early jab, while Damer expressed worry and frustration more recently about the alumni community’s support of a now-controversial alum, Antonio García Martínez.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator says that the two founders were removed from Bookface because they broke community guidelines, namely the rule to never externally post any internal information from Bookface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The now-public ousting of Biggar and Damer, who turned to Twitter to first explain their experiences, is a nuanced situation. Y Combinator says that it has only removed a “dozen or so” founders in its 16 year history for violating YC ethics and Bookface forum guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, YC’s decision to remove these founders, especially in light of a broader reckoning around free speech and dissent within startups, has triggered a series of questions &#8212; some by YC founders themselves &#8212; around how the accelerator moderates its community, handles negative publicity and draws its own line around what can be openly said by its alumni base without consequence.</span></p>
<h2><b>Privacy first</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best curated communities allow participants to safely, and freely, share personal experiences, debate, and even disagree. Part of that safety comes from what some see as a common rule within communities: don’t share private information publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per YC, respecting privacy is a key rule for anyone who joins Bookface, an internal messaging forum that includes some 6,000 founders of the YC community, from alumni to management to current batch companies. Founders log in daily, asking for introductions to a crypto accountant or bringing up a recent job posting for crowdsourced suggestions, among other topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ask that founders don’t share anything from the forum with anyone outside of YC, as this is a community built on trust and privacy,” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsaywiese/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsay Wiese-Amos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Y Combinator head of communications, tells TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s more than a polite request. Amos said that when a company is accepted into YC, the founders must sign investment documents, one of which is its founder ethics policy. Within the policy, there are guidelines around the Bookface forum, including the language: “Don&#8217;t share anything in the Forum, or any links to the content posted to it, with anyone outside of YC.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC claims that when a founder breaks the rules, it reaches out to them with a warning, and if the rule is broken multiple times, that individual is removed from the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a startup is removed from the YC community, YC “generally” returns the shares to the company, though it says there are exceptions. In Damer’s case, says Amos, her “co-founder is still actively working on Prolific, and both he and Prolific remain part of the YC community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Biggar’s YC startup closed eight months after graduating from the accelerator, so YC didn’t have to sever financial ties.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garry Tan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Initialized Capital, and a former YC partner who has stakes in alumni companies including Coinbase, thinks there is a difference between a critical discussion and breaking community rules. Tan tells TechCrunch that discussions are fine, but that these “founders violated privacy expectations of other people within the community.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think YC has become an institution, and institutions are viewed with high scrutiny,” he said. “That’s not a bad thing, it’s probably how it should be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;‘too far’ moment is when people try to ascribe specific political viewpoints to an institution when that institution is A) a lot of people not just a few and B) probably innocent of specifically pushing one viewpoint or another,” Tan continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC’s Bookface rules are seemingly cut and dried. However, in light of the actions it took against Biggar and Damer, it’s fair to wonder what happens if someone in the community disparages YC publicly, but not having to do with Bookface. Is that also an offense that would get them kicked out of the organization? And would the organization make an exception for especially promising founders?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amos suggests that all founders are treated equally and that dissent is welcome. “We believe strongly in free speech and are open to criticism. People are allowed to criticize YC and would not get kicked out of the community for doing so,” she said.</span></p>
<h2><b>‘I had no faith in Y Combinator doing the right thing’</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbiggar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biggar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went through Y Combinator in 2010. “I was like a Paul Graham acolyte,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I have a signed copy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackers and Painters</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, read every essay that he put out, and as soon as I finished my PhD, I applied to Y Combinator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over a decade, Biggar says, he has been an active participant in Bookface, recently helping multiple companies with financial and relationship advice on co-founder break-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Black Lives Matter movement was growing last summer, Biggar noticed that Bookface was relatively quiet and, as he describes it, “apolitical, but in a derogatory way” around issues such as diversity and police brutality. He compared the tone of Bookface to that of Coinbase, after CEO Brian Armstrong</span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">published a memo that banned political discussions at work.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biggar’s frustration grew, hitting a tipping point in March when he spotted a founder bragging on the forum that he had skipped a vaccine queue and offering tips to help other founders do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Biggar tweeted: “For the second time, a @ycombinator founder has posted to the internal YC forum about how they lied to skip the vaccine queue in Oakland, with instructions for other founders to do the same. Absolutely fucking disgusted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biggar left out screenshots of the founder’s post or any identifying material to protect the individual’s anonymity. But within hours of publishing the tweet, Biggar received a direct message on Twitter from Y Combinator co-founder Jessica Livingston, asking him to alert a partner at YC about inappropriate content on Bookface. She added: “You may get a faster and more thorough response than posting to all of Twitter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His response to her: “Hey Jessica! Truth be told, I’m so disillusioned with YC that it never even occurred to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biggar decided to leave up the tweet. Meanwhile, because Biggar was apparently not alone in his view of the content on Bookface &#8212; Amos says that “the community made its perspective quite clear in the comments: they were not in agreement with this founder” offering vaccination hacks  &#8212; YC says it deleted the post less than 24 hours after it appeared on Bookface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The episode wasn&#8217;t even on his mind, Biggar says, when he received an email from</span><a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/author/jon-levy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon Levy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the managing director of partnerships at YC, asking to chat last week. To Biggar&#8217;s surprise, Levy told him that he was being removed from the YC community. That meant he was being removed not just from Bookface, says Biggar, but he is no longer invited to Demo Day or allowed on YC Slack.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">lol just got kicked out of <a href="https://twitter.com/ycombinator?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ycombinator</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paul Biggar (@paulbiggar) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulbiggar/status/1400904600421535744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Biggar says that YC didn’t give him a warning or the option to take down any posts before ushering him out of the broader YC community, though he suspected it was becoming stricter about its community rules. A week before he was booted, Biggar says that Y Combinator reminded founders about a “no leak” policy within Bookface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC offers a different recounting of the events, saying it was only “recently” notified of Biggar’s tweet through someone in the YC community and that all founders are given a warning. YC also states that a founder is removed only after violating its terms “multiple” times, while Biggar maintains that he only once tweeted about Bookface. Asked about other examples of Biggar violating its terms, YC declined to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Biggar now of these recent events: &#8220;I got criticized for not posting it internally, which I think is kind of bullshit. But, you know, the reason I didn&#8217;t post it internally is just that I had no faith in Y Combinator doing the right thing. I didn&#8217;t think that going public would do anything, either. I mean, I’m not someone who actually matters here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the smallest way that one could possibly call out YC,” Biggar continues. “A couple of community members did a shitty thing, which I think is reflective of the community. That for them is, like, too much dissent &#8212; shut it all down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not “the people who have been elevated to part-time partners [or are] tight with the people that matter,” no one “cares what you think. No one ever asks what you think . . .You can’t have dissent internally. There are just too many disciples.”</span></p>
<h2><b>‘YC is not soul-searching’</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damer’s own removal from Bookface might not have been publicized if not for Biggar sharing on Twitter last week that he’d just been “kicked out.” Soon after, she</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ekadamer/status/1400956227501318146"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">came forward,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tweeting to him that “2 weeks ago, YC kicked me out as well” for her public critique. Specifically, says Damer, she was thrown off Bookface because she called out misogyny and the lack of diversity within the accelerator community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It began with a memo on Bookface with the title: “Is YC an inclusive organization? If we continue like this, YC will lose its great reputation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her post, Damer explained that she noticed many people defending Antonio García Martínez, the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaos Monkeys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who recently was invited to join Apple, then asked to</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/13/tech/apple-antonio-garcia-martinez/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">leave Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after a</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to investigate his hiring was signed by more than 2,000 Apple employees. They were concerned about specific book passages, including one that reads: “[M]ost women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the Apple employees who circulated the petition, Damer believes the book is proof that García Martínez is a “misogynist,” writing on Bookface about how “disconcerting” she found the outpouring of support for him on the internal platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I care about YC and that’s why I am writing this,” Damer said. “What is happening right now is not normal, and it looks like YC is soul searching. If this doesn’t get under control, YC will start missing out on some of the best deal flow, especially from women and underrepresented founders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livingston soon responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“YC is not ‘soul-searching’,” Livingston wrote. “Antonio participated in YC a decade ago, and I remember him as a decent person&#8230;I think if anything the YC community should be the ones defending Antonio, because many of us have first-hand knowledge of him, instead of just cherry picked quotes from a book. And we know from being in the startup world how often people are criticized unfairly by the press and in social media.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livingston’s post received hundreds of upvotes, while Damer’s post received a handful. Aggravated, Damer soon went to LinkedIn and Twitter to post </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/katia-damer_dear-founders-id-like-to-apologize-to-activity-6799970875278925824-990_/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screenshots of the interaction,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “retracting” any previous praise she’d given to YC’s founders, and advising founders not to give up equity before VCs earn their trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, a YC partner e-mailed Damer with an invitation to reach out to group partners or this partner directly about any YC concerns, according to a document shared with TechCrunch by the accelerator. The partner also explained that one of the community rules at Bookface was not to share anything from the forum with anyone outside of YC. The partner asked Damer to take down the Bookface screenshots. Damer did not respond to the email and did not take down the screenshots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than two weeks later, Damer received a second email from the partner, this time with a clear message: Because she did not delete her posts, Damer had been removed from Bookface and could reach out if she wished to re-engage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communication was extensive compared with the organization’s handling of Biggar’s tweet, and suggests that YC did a far better job in following its own protocols in Damer’s case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, Damer thinks that YC’s guidelines encourage complacency, especially around issues of diversity, and suggests her waning enthusiasm for the organization ties directly to its not “stepping up” for “women when given the chance.” Adds Damer, “I don&#8217;t think any one of [the partners] is malicious, I actually think they are good people. It&#8217;s more about the complacency &#8212; that is what bothers me so much,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for whether she regrets airing her exasperation publicly, she suggests she didn’t have a choice. “People use rules when they don&#8217;t know what else to do. This is about courage, this is about actually standing up for what is right.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Community rules can be clear, but enforcement muddy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is plainly an argument for and against Y Combinator’s deciding to remove founders from its forum. It’s typical of investors to ask portfolio companies to agree to certain terms and conditions. In this case, YC specifically alerts those who join its organization that the privilege of using Bookface comes with its own, additional, terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, whether the terms and conditions around its community are fair or reasonable could become a question mark in the minds of founders who haven’t yet applied to the program &#8212; as could YC’s different handling of two founders who broke the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly speaking, people within communities who feel like they are not being heard internally &#8212; yet who are also being asked not to express their disdain publicly &#8212; are pushing back on such limits. Coinbase saw at least 60 employees leave last fall after being told that the company would no longer tolerate internal political dissent or debate. In late May, the company Basecamp reportedly lost a third of its staff following disagreements over the company&#8217;s attitude toward internal political debates. Most recently, Medium lost half its staff in July</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after a strategy shift and an internally criticized culture memo.</span></a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lDB1ZC48Jw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">Medium sees more employee exits after CEO publishes ‘culture memo’</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Medium sees more employee exits after CEO publishes ‘culture memo’&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/embed/#?secret=lDB1ZC48Jw" data-secret="lDB1ZC48Jw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its successful track record, YC may be more powerful as an institution than any one company, but rivals are always looking for weaknesses, and asking members not to air their grievances outside of YC could ultimately impair the outfit. A generation of founders and operators is showing it is less and less willing to suppress a viewpoint in the service of others, and the most talented of these individuals have no shortage of options when it comes to both mentorship and capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC, with its extensive network &#8212; perhaps even because of it &#8212;  may increasingly find it isn&#8217;t immune to the trend.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 9, 2021. Today was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility</a>, a rollicking good time and one that we hoped you enjoyed. Looking ahead, we’re starting to announce some speakers for Disrupt &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/join-accels-arun-mathew-at-techcrunch-disrupt-in-our-debate-around-alt-financing/">Accel’s Arun Mathew</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report/"><strong>Biden tears down Trump’s Chinese app wall</strong></a><strong>: </strong>After a very confusing episode in which the former U.S. president demanded that TikTok sell to an American company and that the U.S. government get a cut, things are mostly back to normal today after President Biden “signed an executive order revoking actions targeting TikTok and WeChat,” TechCrunch reports. Biden also signed a “new order requiring the Commerce Department to review apps with ties to ‘jurisdiction of foreign adversaries,’” so this story is not yet finished.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/swedish-company-northvolt-raises-2-75b-to-accelerate-european-battery-production/"><strong>Billions for battery tech</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Northvolt has raised a $2.75 billion round to build its in-Europe battery manufacturing capacity to 150 GWh by 2030. While 2030 may sound far away, it’s under a decade from now. The news of Northvolt’s round underscores how many regions want to ensure that they can build core technology products like batteries, chips and AI on their own as a way to limit geopolitical risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/ai-startup-investment-is-on-pace-for-a-record-year/"><strong>Everyone wants to fund AI startups</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The era in which every startup claimed to be an AI company is behind us, leaving us with the era in which every VC wants to fund AI startups. That’s the gist of a recent TechCrunch dig into the hot and busy fundraising market for startups leveraging artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/branch-raises-50m-to-offer-bundled-auto-home-insurance-via-an-api/"><strong>Branch finds more backers for its insurtech service</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Bundled home-and-auto insurtech startup Branch has raised a $50 million round led by Anthemis Group. The company’s pitch is that it starts customers off with a bundle, meaning that it doesn’t have to cross-sell them later on. VCs are still more than willing to pour capital into neo-insurance providers, despite some struggles from unicorns in the space after they went public.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/shelflife-a-marketplace-for-raw-materials-raises-3-million-seed-round/"><strong>ShelfLife wants to help you source raw materials</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Ever wanted to produce and sell your own version of White Claw? Lillian Cartwright and some fellow Harvard Business School folks had that idea, but ran into supply issues. Cartwright built ShelfLife, which helps brands by providing “a directory and marketplace of raw material suppliers based on what brands actually, specifically need, allowing them to secure quotes quickly.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/mythical-games-raises-75m-to-build-an-nft-game-engine/"><strong>If you are tired of insurtech rounds, how about an NFT round</strong></a><strong>? </strong>Mythical Games announced a $75 million round despite fading near-term momentum in the market for blockchain-specific digital ownership writs. Regardless of what you think about NFTs, it’s clear that VCs are bullish and are willing to pay up to not miss a possible trend.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/stacey-abrams-cofounded-fintech-company-now-raises-9-5m/"><strong>American political luminary Stacey Abrams’ Now raises $9.5M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Now is a fintech company that buys corporate invoices for a fee, allowing companies to unlock revenue before they get paid. Provided that it can properly assess nonpayment risk, it’s a pretty business-friendly model.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/contentstack-raises-57-5m-for-its-headless-content-management-system/"><strong>Behead your CMS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>If you are not hip to headless CMS tools, imagine WordPress but without the bits that make it render in your browser. The headless model has attracted backers in a more fractured end-user device world, where users might access content on everything from smartwatches to tablets to desktops to VR helmets. And now Contentstack’s headless CMS service is $57.5 million richer after an investment led by Insight Partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>To round out our startup news today, two things: The first is that Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra and his buddy Todd Goldberg, the founder of Eventjoy, have formalized their investing partnership in a new fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/todd-and-rahuls-angel-fund-closes-new-24-million-fund/">called Todd and Rahul’s Angel Fund</a>. That name has big “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure” vibes, albeit with a larger, $24 million budget.</p>
<p>And fresh on the heels of the Equity Podcast diving into hormonal health and the huge startup opportunity that it presents, there’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/allara-pcos-ro-rachel-blank/">new startup working on PCOS on the market</a>. Check out our look at its early form.</p>
<h2>Don’t panic: ‘Algorithm updates’ aren’t the end of the world for SEO managers</h2>
<p>SEO expert and consultant Eli Schwartz will join Managing Editor Danny Crichton tomorrow to share his advice for everyone who gets nervous each time Google updates its algorithm.</p>
<p>To set a foundation for <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnlQMVajGO">tomorrow&#8217;s chat on Twitter Spaces</a>, Eli shared a guest post that should deflate some myths. For starters: A drop in search traffic isn&#8217;t necessarily hurting you.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing the algorithm, he advises companies that rely on organic search results to focus on the user experience instead: &#8220;If you are helpful to the user, you have nothing to fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like you release product updates based on feedback and analytics, Google’s improving its products to offer a better user experience.</p>
<p>“If you see a drop, in many cases, your site might not have even lost real traffic,” says Eli. “Often, the losses represent only lost impressions already not converting into clicks.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s discussion is the latest in a series of chats with top Extra Crunch guest contributors. If you&#8217;ve worked with a talented growth marketer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">please share a brief recommendation</a>.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/google-announces-the-firmina-subsea-cable-between-the-u-s-to-argentina/"><strong>Google is building a huge fiber trunk to Argentina</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Imagine you were a megacorp. And the internet was a bit slow between your headquarters, and, say, Argentina. Do you curse your luck? Stamp your feet? Or do you announce that you are going to “build a new subsea cable that will connect the East Coast of the U.S. and Las Toninas, Argentina — with additional landings in Brazil and Uruguay” as Google did? We hope it’s the final option.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/"><strong>Did you know that it’s Facebook’s creator week</strong></a><strong>?</strong> It is, as it turns out. Big Blue announced a “native affiliate tool” for Instagram that will allow “creators to recommend products available on checkout, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales their posts drive.” The idea may prove annoying for non-influencers, but for the folks with large followings it could be a boon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/carlyle-acquires-1e-com-an-endpoint-and-hybrid-working-specialist-in-270m-deal/"><strong>$270M for end-point security shop 1E</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Rising acceptance of remote work means more and more end points for companies to secure. To see Carlyle pick up 1E for a quarter-billion, then, is not a surprise in substance. Crunchbase has no funding data from the London-based company, so perhaps this was a pretty big exit for its team.</li>
