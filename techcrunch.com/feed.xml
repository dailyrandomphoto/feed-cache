										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange year for sleep. For me, levels have fluctuated between too little and too much, but have – more often than not – tended toward the former. 2020 gave most of us no shortage of excuses for sleep deprivation, from personal stresses to larger societal concerns.</p>
<p>And, thankfully, the past few years have seen no shortage of technological solutions to the problem of sleeplessness. Of course, the underpinning issues can be hard to isolate and even harder to treat. There’s no silver bullet. That’s the lesson I keep relearning at this job – no single piece of technology is going to cure all of my ills. (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s nothing that years of extensive and expensive therapy can&#8217;t fix.)</p>
<p>Sleep headphones are, in and of themselves, not an entirely new phenomenon. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> got into the space in earnest back in mid-2018, offering one of the more polished (and pricey) approaches to the category. The company went in an entirely different direction than, say, <a href="https://kokoon.io/">Kokoon</a>, which offers an over-ear solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Sleepbuds are – as the name suggests – fully wireless earbuds. This second generation allows Bose to address some of the bigger issues with the original – include some major battery complaints. That was a pretty big strike against a $250 pair of headphones with, quite literally, one job.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The battery and connections complaints, I can state, off the bat, seem to have been addressed. The units I’ve been wearing to sleep off and on for a few weeks now haven’t had any major connection issues to speak of (assuming you keep your phone near your bed and all that entails), and the battery generally gets me through a full night bit a bit under 20% remaining. After you wake up, you toss them in the case and let them charge for the next several hours.</p>

<p>All told, the build is solid, as you’d expect/hope from the company name and accompanying price point. I really dig the design of these things, overall, from the illuminating metal charging case with its sliding lid to the earbuds themselves. As someone who finds the slightest irritants a major hurdle to falling asleep, I was pleasantly surprised by how unobtrusive the buds are. They slip on comfortably and stay flush with the ear, so nothing gets snagged. The soft and rubbery wings also do a great job keeping them in place.</p>
<p>The buds biggest limitation is actually by design. Like the originals, the Sleepbuds II only work with the included app. This is used to pair them, locate them and offers Bose’s library of music. The company generally does a good job curating its own sleep sounds, ranging from nature sounds like rain and wind to self-selected ambient tracks. I got in the habit of listening to the sounds of the ocean while reading <em>Moby Dick</em> each night. A pretty good way to fall asleep, all told.</p>
<p>I appreciate the decision to hamper the functionality to some degree – I suspect I would probably start listening to podcasts and TV shows on the thing, left to my own devices (so to speak). But I would love to see what the buds could do with, say, binaural beats or some other ambient selections. Ultimately, I think giving the consumer choice is ultimately a net positive.</p>
<p>That said, the headphones are well-tuned for their limited (but expanding) library of sounds. There’s no active noise canceling, but the passive cancelation of the buds themselves plus the on-board sound do a good job blocking out things like environmental noise or snoring. They’re probably no match for, say, construction noise, but do a good job with subtler barriers to sleep. They’ll also likely be a good choice for long flights, when we start doing those again.</p>
<p>There are a handful of headphones currently positioned for the sleep market, but Bose’s look to be the most polished package at the moment. The price will understandably be a barrier for many – and the limited sound library could be a dealbreaker for some. But if you have the money – and find getting and staying asleep tough – they’re well worth exploring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Los Angeles-based extended reality data visualization company, <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a>, first heard that one of its earliest benefactors, Magic Leap, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/magic-leap-announces-layoffs-amid-covid-19-slowdown/">was about to shed 1,000 jobs and was fighting for its life</a>, the young startup was unfazed.</p>
<p>Despite the very public ties that BadVR had to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as one of the enterprise applications on the platform, the startup was more insulated than other businesses from the pivot away from consumer-focused apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/my-experience-with-the-cares-act-was-frustrating-confusing-and-unfair/">The first step was finding money from the government&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program </a>to get more capital coming in and maintaining its headcount. Eventually, the company managed to land additional financing in the form of a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the second grant that the company has taken from the NSF and is an example of how startups can turn to government funding for capital and avoid some of the pitfalls of fundraising from venture capital.</p>
<p>To be sure, even <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> trip to the brink of collapse wouldn&#8217;t have been that bad for BadVR, which makes enterprise applications for extended reality devices.</p>
<p>What the Magic Leap story shows is that companies don&#8217;t need to take venture capital to make it. Indeed, as costs come down for equipment and remote work democratizes access to a country that&#8217;s still teeming with engineering talent, thrifty startups can get the capital they need from government sources and corporate innovation grants.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how BadVR got most of its $3.5 million in financing. Some money came from a grant from BadVR, while at least $1.25 million has come from the government in the form of two <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> cooperative agreements through the Small Business Innovation Research financing mechanisms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091683" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091683" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091683" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091683" class="wp-caption-text">A headset capture of BadVR’s climate change application, built for the Magic Leap One headset.<strong> Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>BadVR uses virtual and augmented reality tools to visualize geospatial data for a range of government and commercial applications. The startup&#8217;s tech is already being used by big telecom companies to accelerate the planning and deployment of 5G networks. And, within the public safety sector, the company&#8217;s tech is used to improve situational awareness for first responders and to reduce training, staffing, and operational costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Society has become aware of the power of data and the impact it has on our daily lives. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s critically important that we make the access of data easy to every organization, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regardless of technical skill level or background,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Suzanne Borders, the chief executive and f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ounder of BadVR, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>For Borders, the key to tapping government funding is all about proper advance planning. &#8220;Those take a long time,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;When you get awarded them, you&#8217;re looking at a year&#8217;s worth of effort. [Our grant] was a testament to us planning for that about a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>These grants are typically milestone-based, so as long as BadVR was hitting its targets, it could be fairly assured that the money would be there.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NSF is proud to support the technology of the future by thinking beyond incremental  developments and funding the most creative, impactful ideas across all markets and  areas of science and engineering,” said Andrea Belz, Division Director of the Division of  Industrial Innovation and Partnerships at NSF. “With the support of our research funds,  any deep technology startup or small business can guide basic science into meaningful  solutions that address tremendous needs.”  </span></p>
<p>Other government competitions are providing the company with additional non-dilutive cash and a chance to kcik the tires on new capabilities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg 2878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=1536,852 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=2048,1136 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091680" class="wp-caption-text">A capture from BadVR’s augmented reality geospatial data environment, which allows users to visualize multiple live and historical datasets via overlays relevant to their environment. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>That has translated into traction for the company&#8217;s Augmented Reality Operations Center. The AROC is a new offering for the product that visualizes data for first responders. Through a challenge hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, BadVR was able to work with the Eureka, Mo. Fire Department to develop a prototype for a specific emergency situation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an evolution of an early product the company had developed where enterprises can create digital twins of their factories or stores in virtual reality and do a walk-through to examine different conditions.</p>
<p>The visualization work that BadVR does isn&#8217;t necessarily all geo-spatial. The company can take all kinds of data and integrate that into an environment that makes the data easier to see. Borders sees the company&#8217;s services extending into creating all kinds of collaborative environments for companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system highlights things that are important to look at,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;It&#8217;s virtualizing the data visualization experience and bringing it into an immersive environment &#8212; and building a more collaborative aspect to that experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses across the country to operate virtually, Borders said the demand for the kinds of. products her company is building &#8212; with the government&#8217;s help &#8212; has only increased.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s been due to increased demand for remote collaboration tools,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;We’ve had increased interest in people across the board &#8212; but tools that have remote collaboration capabilities &#8212; and bring people together to one immersive data experience… those are taking off.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of what made 2020 such an absolute nightmare will still be with us on January 1 (sorry!), we will really, truly be leaving Adobe <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flash">Flash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and FarmVille behind as we enter the new year.</p>
<p>The end of Flash has been a long time coming. The plugin, which was first released in 1996 and once supported a broad swath online content, has become increasingly irrelevant in a smartphone-centric world: iPhones never supported Flash, and it&#8217;s been just over 10 years since Apple&#8217;s then-CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-tells-the-world-just-what-he-thinks-of-flash/">published an open letter</a> outlining the technology&#8217;s shortcomings.</p>
<p>Adobe has been planning for the end, announcing in 2017 that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/get-ready-to-say-goodbye-to-flash-in-2020/">phase out Flash by the end of this year</a>. Most web browsers have already stopped supporting Flash, and today is the official end date, with Adobe ending support itself — although there&#8217;s still one last &#8220;death of Flash&#8221; milestone on January 12, when the company will begin to block Flash content from playing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In related news, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com/a/farmville/?s=announcements&amp;f=important-announcement&amp;l=en">announced recently</a> that the end of Flash would also mean the end of FarmVille, since the game relies on the Flash plugin.</p>

<p>Like Flash, FarmVille feels like a remnant of a bygone internet era (a fact that makes me feel incredibly old, since I wrote plenty of words about both of them at the beginning of my career). <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Launched in 2009, FarmVille&#8217;s popularity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/technology/farmville-zynga-facebook.html">paved the way for the ascendance of Zynga and of Facebook gaming</a>, but both Zynga and gaming have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/zynga-q3-earnings/">largely moved on</a>.</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and former CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-pincus" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-pincus">Mark Pincus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commemorated the occasion with <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742344948498432">a series of tweets</a> outlining the game&#8217;s early development (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/07/zynga-buys-virtual-home-startup-myminilife/">spurred by the acquisition of startup MyMiniLife</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;FarmVille demonstrated that a game could be a living, always-on service that could deliver daily surprise and delight, similar to a favorite TV series,&#8221; Pincus wrote. &#8220;Games could also connect groups of people and bring them closer together.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just in case there are any FarmVille fans reading this story, don&#8217;t worry: you can still play FarmVille 2: Tropic Escape, FarmVille 2: Country Escape right now, and FarmVille 3 is still coming to mobile. Today is just the final day for the original game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the last day of 2020, New York City’s Metro Transit Authority announced that it <a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/mta-milestone-omny-rollout-to-be-completed-thursday-al-putre-interview">has finished its roll out</a> of contactless payment systems. With the addition of a final stop in Brooklyn, every MTA subway station and bus in the five boroughs now sports the OMNY “Tap and Go” system.</p>
<p>We got an early demo of the Grand Central terminals when the project rollout began last May. The system involves a major infrastructure overhaul as the transit authority looks beyond the iconic Metro Card to mobile payment systems from vendors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Google, Samsung and Fitbit – allowing users to use smartphones and smartwatches to swipe their way through the turn style.</p>

<p>The MTA had expected to finish the project by October – though COVID-19 put the kibosh on those plans along with so much else. The goal was pushed back to December, and it appears it&#8217;s been met with no time to spare.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>MetroCards are sticking around for the time being – though the MTA expects they will be phased out at some point in 2023. Part of the transition involves the arrival of the OMNY Card, which use the new technology but function similarly to MetroCard. A reduced far version of the card is set to arrive for riders who qualify at some point in 2021. The new readers are also coming to the Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I edited hundreds of stories in 2020, so choosing my favorites would be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve tried to gather a sample of Extra Crunch stories that taught me something new. (Which means this top 10 list betrays my ignorance, a humbling admission for a know-it-all like myself.)</p>
<p>While narrowing down the field of candidates, I realized that we&#8217;re covering each of the topics on this list in greater depth next year. We already have stories in the works about no-code software, the emergence of edtech, proptech and B2B marketplaces, to name just a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some readers are skeptical about paywalls, but without being boastful, Extra Crunch is a premium product, just like Netflix or Disney+. I know: We&#8217;re not as entertaining as a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II or a space western about a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>But, speaking as someone who&#8217;s worked at several startups, Extra Crunch stories contain actionable information you can use to build a company and/or look smart in meetings — and that&#8217;s worth something.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a very happy new year.</p>

<h2>1. The VCs who founders love the most</h2>

<p>Managing Editor Danny Crichton spearheaded the development of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/">The TechCrunch List</a> earlier this year to help seed-stage founders connect with VCs who write first checks.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch List has no paywall and contains details and recommendations about more than 400 investors across 22 verticals. Once it launched, Danny crunched the data to pick out 11 investors for which &#8220;founders were particularly effusive in their praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm uses his weekday column The Exchange to keep a close eye on &#8220;private companies, public markets and the gray space in between,&#8221; but one effort stood out: An overview of six API-based startups that were &#8220;raising capital in rapid-fire fashion&#8221; when many companies were trying to find their COVID-19 footing.</p>
<p>For me, this was particularly interesting because it helped me better understand that an optimal pricing structure can be key to a SaaS company&#8217;s initial success.</p>

<p>Two stories about the advent of no-code/low-code software that we ran in July take the third and fourth position on this list.</p>
<p>I have been a no-code user for some time: Using Zapier to send automated invitations via Slack for group lunches was a real time-saver in the pre-pandemic days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprise expenditure on custom software is on track to double from $250 billion in 2015 to $500 billion in 2020,&#8221; so we&#8217;ll definitely be diving deeper into this topic in the coming months.</p>

<p>In 2018, B2B marketplaces saw an estimated $680 billion in sales, but that figure is expected to reach $3.6 trillion by 2024.</p>
<p>As companies shifted their purchasing online, these platforms are adding a range of complementary services like payment management, targeted advertising and logistics while also hardening their infrastructure.</p>

<p>Reporter Lucas Matney spoke to Caryn Marooney in August at TechCrunch Early Stage about how startup founders who hope to expand their reach need to do a better job of connecting with journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;People just fundamentally aren’t walking around caring about this new startup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, nobody does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s been on both sides of this equation, I most appreciated her advice about focusing on &#8220;simplicity and staying consistent&#8221; when it comes to messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t let the complexity of your intellect cloud what needs to be simple,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>During &#8220;the early innings of this period of uncertainty,&#8221; an article we published offered several predictions about investor behavior in the U.S.</p>
<p>Although we posted this in April, each of these forecasts seem spot-on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Future of work: promoting intimacy and trust.</li>
<li>Healthcare IT: telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.</li>
<li>Robotics and supply chain.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity.</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve always found the concept of total addressable market (TAM) hard to embrace fully — the arrival of a single disruptive company could change an industry&#8217;s TAM in a week.</p>
<p>However, several factors are combining to transform the construction industry: high fragmentation, poor communication, a skilled labor shortage and a lack of data transparency.</p>
<p>Startups that help builders manage aspects like pre-construction, workflow and site visualization are making huge strides, but because &#8220;construction firms spend less than 2% of annual sales volume on IT,&#8221; the size of this TAM is not at all speculative.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I&#8217;m including a TechCrunch op-ed written by insurtech founder Kevin Henderson that describes the myriad challenges he has faced as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Some of the discussions about the lack of diversity in tech can feel abstract, but his post describes its concrete consequences. For starters: he&#8217;s <strong>never</strong> had an opportunity to pitch at a VC firm where there was another Black person in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black founders have a better chance playing pro sports than they do landing venture investments,&#8221; says Henderson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Group is reportedly investing $200 million to bail out <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/katerra" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="katerra">Katerra, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup that had hoped to remake the construction industry with a vertically integrated approach, according to a report in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-200-million-bailout-of-katerra-11609366612?mod=hp_lista_pos3">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Katerra&#8217;s shareholders reportedly approved the new investment on Wednesday, with the new lifeline from SoftBank coming on top of roughly $2 billion that the Japanese technology conglomerate had already committed to the venture.</p>
<p>Funds for the bailout, which will save Katerra from bankruptcy, will be coming from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1, the Journal quoted Katerra chief executive Paal Kibsgaard as telling company shareholders in a message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the funding, the SoftBank-financed financial services firm, Greensill Capital, is cancelling around $435 million in debt in exchange for a 5% stake in the company, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<p>This new bailout actually marks the second time that SoftBank has stepped in to dole out $200 million to Katerra this year alone.</p>
<p>In May, when Kibsgaard, the former head of oil services developer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/schlumberger" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="schlumberger">Schlumberger, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was brought in to fix the company&#8217;s finances, SoftBank poured $200 million into the company so Kibsgaard could right the ship there, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<div>
<p>Katerra has raised multiple hundreds of million dollar rounds from the Japanese technology conglomerate since its launch in 2015. Back in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/construction-startup-katerra-gets-865m-in-softbanks-latest-mega-round/">when the company closed on $865 million in financing</a>, Katerra was claiming bookings for $1.3 billion worth of commercial and residential projects ranging from hospitality to student housing. That&#8217;s a large number, but a fraction of the $1 trillion spent on construction in the month of November 2018 alone, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We're going to start to see a lot of real value and ROI generated by AI across more and more businesses,"]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/scale-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="scale-2">Scale AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Alexandr Wang doesn&#8217;t need a crystal ball to see where artificial intelligence will be used in the future. He just looks at his customer list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The four-year-old startup, which recently hit a valuation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">more than $3.5 billion</a>, got its start supplying autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to train machine learning models to develop and eventually commercialize robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The wider adoption of AI across industries has been a bit of a slow burn over the past several years as company founders and executives begin to understand what the technology could do for their businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, that changed as e-commerce, enterprise automation, government, insurance, real estate and robotics companies turned to Scale&#8217;s visual data labeling platform to develop and apply artificial intelligence to their respective businesses. Now, the company is preparing for the customer list to grow and become more varied.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How 2020 shaped up for AI</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Scale AI&#8217;s customer list has included an array of autonomous vehicle companies including Alphabet, Voyage, nuTonomy, Embark, Nuro and Zoox. While it began to diversify with additions like Airbnb, DoorDash and Pinterest, there were still sectors that had yet to jump on board. That changed in 2020, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scale began to see incredible use cases of AI within the government as well as enterprise automation, according to Wang. Scale AI began working more closely with government agencies this year and added enterprise automation customers like States Title, a residential real estate company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wang also saw an increase in uses around conversational AI, in both consumer and enterprise applications as well as growth in e-commerce as companies sought out ways to use AI to provide personalized recommendations for its customers that were on par with Amazon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Robotics continued to expand as well in 2020, although it spread to use cases beyond robotaxis, autonomous delivery and self-driving trucks, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A lot of the innovations that have happened within the self-driving industry, we&#8217;re starting to see trickle out throughout a lot of other robotics problems,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;And so it&#8217;s been super exciting to see the breadth of AI continue to broaden and serve our ability to support all these use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The wider adoption of AI across industries has been a bit of a slow burn over the past several years as company founders and executives begin to understand what the technology could do for their businesses, Wang said, adding that advancements in natural language processing of text, improved offerings from cloud companies like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud and greater access to datasets helped sustain this trend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We&#8217;re finally getting to the point where we can help with computational AI, which has been this thing that&#8217;s been pitched for forever,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That slow burn heated up with the COVID-19 pandemic, said Wang, noting that interest has been particularly strong within government and enterprise automation as these entities looked for ways to operate more efficiently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There was this big reckoning,&#8221; Wang said of 2020 and the effect that COVID-19 had on traditional business enterprises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the future is mostly remote with consumers buying online instead of in-person, companies started to ask, &#8220;How do we start building for that?,&#8221; according to Wang.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The push for operational efficiency coupled with the capabilities of the technology is only going to accelerate the use of AI for automating processes like mortgage applications or customer loans at banks, Wang said, who noted that outside of the tech world there are industries that still rely on a lot of paper and manual processes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">Salesforce acquired Quip</a> in 2016 for $750 million, it gained CEO and co-founder Bret Taylor as part of the deal. Taylor has since risen quickly through the ranks of the software giant to become president and COO, second in command behind CEO Marc Benioff. Taylor&#8217;s experience shows that startup founders can sometimes play a key role in the companies that acquire them.</p>
<p>Benioff, 56, has been running <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> since its founding more than 20 years ago. While he hasn&#8217;t given any public hints that he intends to leave anytime soon, if he wanted to step back from the day-to-day running of the company or even job share the role, he has a deep bench of executive talent including many experienced CEOs, who like Taylor came to the company via acquisition.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			One way to step back from the enormous responsibility of running Salesforce would be by sharing the role.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He and his wife Lynne have been active in charitable giving and in 2016 <a href="https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=165">signed The Giving Pledge</a>, an initiative from the The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to give a majority of their wealth to philanthropy. One could see him wanting to put more time into pursuing these charitable endeavors just as Gates did 20 years ago. As a means of comparison, Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 and stayed for 25 years <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2000/01/13/mu7.html?sh=401547ad5d83">until he left in 2000</a> to run his charitable foundation full time.</p>
<p>Even if this remains purely speculative for the moment, there is a group of people behind him with deep industry experience, who could be well-suited to take over should the time ever come.</p>
<h2>Resurrecting the co-CEO role</h2>
<p>One way to step back from the enormous responsibility of running Salesforce would be by sharing the role. In fact, for more than a year starting in 2018, Benioff actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/salesforce-promotes-coo-keith-block-to-co-ceo/">shared the top job</a> with Keith Block until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/salesforce-co-ceo-keith-block-steps-down/">his departure last year</a>. When they worked together, the arrangement seemed to work out just fine with Block dealing with many larger customers and helping the software giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/as-block-exits-salesforce-forecasts-it-will-surpass-20b-in-revenue-in-fy2021/">reach its $20 billion revenue goal</a>.</p>
<p>Before Block became co-CEO, he had a myriad other high-level titles including co-chairman, president and COO &#8212; two of which, by the way, Taylor has today. That was a lot of responsibility for one person inside a company the size of Salesforce, but promoting him to co-CEO from COO gave the company a way to reward his hard work and help keep him from jumping ship (he eventually did anyway).</p>
<p>As Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research points out, the co-CEO concept has worked out well at major enterprise companies that have tried it in the past, and it helped with continuity. &#8220;Salesforce, SAP and Oracle all didn&#8217;t miss a beat really with the co-CEO departures,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If Benioff wanted to go back to the shared responsibility model and take some work off his plate, making Taylor (or someone else) co-CEO would be one way to achieve that. Certainly, Brent Leary, lead analyst at CRM Essentials sees Taylor gaining increasing responsibility as time goes along, giving credence to the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since Quip was acquired Taylor seemed to be on the fast track, becoming president and chief product officer less than a year-and-a-half after the acquisition, and then two years later being promoted to chief operating officer,” Leary said.</p>
<h2>Who else could be in line?</h2>
<p>While Taylor isn&#8217;t the only person who could step into Benioff&#8217;s shoes, he looks like he has the best shot at the moment, especially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">in light of the $27.7 billion Slack deal</a> he helped deliver earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taylor being publicly praised by Benioff for playing a significant role in the Slack acquisition, Salesforce&#8217;s largest acquisition to date, shows how much he has solidified his place at the highest levels of influence and decision-making in the organization,&#8221; Leary pointed out.</p>
<p>But Mueller posits that his rapid promotions could also show something might be lacking with internal options, especially around product. &#8220;Taylor is a great, smart guy, but his rise shows more the product organization bench depth challenges that Salesforce has,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee faces a nine-year prison term in the bribery case that contributed to the downfall of former president Park Guen-hye. Prosecutors argued that the length of the sentence is warranted because of Samsung’s power as the largest chaebol, or family-owned conglomerate, in South Korea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Samsung is a group with such overwhelming power that it is said Korean companies are divided into Samsung and non-Samsung,&#8221; they said during a final hearing on Wednesday, <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20201230000736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> the Korea Herald. The final ruling is scheduled for January 18.</p>
<p>The bribery case is separate from another trial Lee is involved in, over alleged accounting fraud and stock-price manipulation. Hearings in that case began in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hearings begin in Samsung vice chairman Jay Y. Lee&#8217;s accounting fraud trial&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/hearings-begin-in-samsung-vice-chairman-jay-y-lees-accounting-fraud-trial/embed/#?secret=exs8HRsUoX" data-secret="exs8HRsUoX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The bribery case dates back to 2017, when Lee was convicted of bribing Park and her close associate Choi Soon-sil and sentenced to five years in prison. Prosecutors allege the bribes were meant to secure government backing for Lee&#8217;s attempt to inherit control of Samsung from his father Lee Kun-hee, then its chairman. The illegal payments were a major part of the corruption scandal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/world/asia/park-geun-hye-sentenced-south-korea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">led to Park’s impeachment, arrest and 25-year prison sentence</a>.</p>
<p>Lee was freed in 2018 after the sentence was reduced and suspended on appeal, and returned to work as Samsung&#8217;s de facto head, a position he took after his father <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/16/as-samsungs-chairman-remains-hospitalized-south-korea-prepares-for-its-next-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had a heart attack in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2019, however, the Supreme Court overturned the appeals court, ruling that it was too lenient, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/world/asia/samsung-jy-lee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered that the case be retried in Seoul High Court</a>.</p>
<p>The elder Lee, who was reportedly South Korea’s wealthiest citizen, died in October. He was worth an estimated $20.7 billion and under the country’s tax system, he and his heirs could be liable for estate taxes of about $10 billion, <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/samsung-chairman-heir-tax-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Fortune</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has contacted Samsung for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don’t need <a href="https://qoobo.info/index-en/">Qoobo</a> in your life. Nobody <em>needs</em> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qoobo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qoobo">Qoobo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> exactly. In fact, first reactions tend to range from befuddlement to bemusement. The robotic cat pillow doesn’t make a ton of sense on the face of it — in part because Qoobo has no face.</p>
<p>The handful of times I’ve interacted with the original Qoobo in person, reactions have been pretty uniform. The initial confusion gives way to the question of why such a thing needs to exist. And then, inevitably, someone asks how they can buy one of their own.</p>
<p>The original, larger version was fairly difficult to get here in the States for a while, owing to the limitation of a small robotics company has in bringing its product to a brand new market. I suspect there was also a question of whether such an idiosyncratic product would translate. In the end, however, there’s nothing particularly confusing about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>At its subtly beating heart is an attempt to deliver comfort in a small, furry package. It’s something we could all probably use more of these days. Following a successful Indiegogo campaign, the new Petit Qoobo delivers that in a smaller, more affordable design. “Petit Qoobo is a cushion-shaped robot with a tail,” the included user guide begins. “When stroked, the tail waves gently.”</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s kind of the whole deal here. It’s a furry pillow with a robotic tail that waves when pet. Pet it more vigorously and the tail responds in kind. The pillow has a built-in mic that listens for sound (though not specific words), which can elicit a wag. I’ve found that things like a knock on the door or loud music can also trigger this effect. It will also just wag at random “just to say ‘hello’.”</p>

<p>Petit Qoobo is sitting on my lap as I write this. And yes, it’s soothing. It’s not a replacement for a real pet — but I also know full well that my real pet (pictured above) would not be as chill about sitting on my lap while I try to get some work done. When I’m finished petting Qoobo, there’s no protest — the tail simply goes slack.</p>
<p>The robot will also “go to sleep” after extensive petting — in order to save on charge, one assumes. When time comes to recharge, there’s a port located — let’s just say it&#8217;s near the tail. A zipper along the outside makes it possible to remove the fur coat altogether for cleaning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ezgif-1-b92a08625a88.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The tail mechanism isn’t loud, per se, but it’s audible. You can hear the actuators moving as it goes to work. Honestly, the buzzing is more charming than anything. The only time it’s an issue is when using the device as a pillow. Qoobo’s other clever trick is a quiet heartbeat that triggers when squeezed. It’s a nice, calming effect — though one that can sometimes be overpowered by the tail noise.</p>
<p>The device is part of a long and fascinating lineage of Japanese therapy robotics. The most notable example is probably Paro, which dates back to the 90s. The baby seal was designed to calm and comfort patients in hospitals and nursing rooms — essentially a way to bring the benefits of therapy animals without having to have actual animals involved. Of course, that project, which ultimately cost around $15 million in development, is on an entirely different scale than this product from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yukai-engineering" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yukai-engineering">Yukai Engineering <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

<p>But the result isn’t entirely dissimilar. There are just certain parts of us that are wired to want to pet something furry and hear a heartbeat — both boxes this strange little robot happily checks. I certainly feel a bit calmer writing this &#8212; and that&#8217;s probably the most you can ask for these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Hyundai acquired a controlling stake in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-dynamics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-dynamics">Boston Dynamics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that valued the company at $1.1 billion. What’s most interesting about the news isn’t the acquisition itself (it does, after all, find Boston Dynamics switching hands for the third time in seven years), but rather what the company’s evolution tells us about the state of robotics in 2020.</p>
<p>When the Waltham, Massachusetts-based startup was acquired by Google in 2013, it was still a carefully cultivated mystery. That the internet’s response to the company was largely one of curiosity shaded with discomfort should come as little surprise. Boston Dynamics’ primary output from a public relations perspective was viral videos of impressive but imposing quadrupedal robots built with the aid of defense department contracts. It doesn’t take a giant leap to begin coloring in the gaps with dystopian sentiment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In instances where robotic deployment has been successful, the technology has helped ease the burden on an impacted workforce.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some of that has continued to follow the company, of course. Even in the age of short attention spans, one doesn’t quickly forget an image of a man in a fleece vest unsuccessfully attempting to kick over a headless buzzing robot in an empty parking lot. Heck, to this day every post I do about the company is greeted with multiple gifs of the knife-wielding robot from the &#8220;Metalhead&#8221; episode of &#8220;Black Mirror.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is still committed to its more bleeding edge R&amp;D concepts, Hyundai didn’t purchase a strange little MIT-spinoff that makes viral internet videos. It purchased a company actively working to monetize those efforts. As CEO Robert Playter told me in a recent interview, the company has sold 400 Spots since opening initial availability around 15 months ago. It’s not a huge number, but it’s a sign that interest in the company’s products extend well beyond novelty.</p>
<p>Spot’s primary task at the moment involves surveying dangerous workplaces, from nuclear reactors to oil rigs. Boston Dynamics’ next product, Handle, will move boxes around a warehouse. That robot is set to go on sale at some point in 2022. “I think something like a robot every couple of years is a pace that we could manage,” Playter told me. “From clean sheet, we can build a new robot in under a year. “And then you have to go through an iterative process of refining that concept and starting to understand market fit.”</p>
<p>Maturity in this industry requires a level of pragmatism. Tasked with describing the state of robotics in 2020, I would probably say it’s something like, “Cool technology employed for uncool tasks.” You can, no doubt, identify exceptions (making special effects for movies like Bot &amp; Dolly is decidedly cool), but on the whole, Boston Dynamics is a perfect example of impressive robots doing boring stuff. Any roboticist will happily hammer into you the concept of the three Ds — the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs where the technology is most likely to be deployed.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will try a significantly different approach to landing its future reusable rocket boosters, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. It will <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344327757916868608">attempt to &#8220;catch&#8221;</a> the heavy booster, which is currently in development, using the launch tower arm used to stabilize the vehicle during its pre-takeoff preparations. Current Falcon 9 boosters return to Earth and land propulsively on their own built-in legs — but the goal with Super Heavy is for the larger rocket <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344344378974720000">not to have legs at all</a>, says Musk.</p>
<p>The Super Heavy launch process will still involve use of its engines to control the velocity of its descent, but it will involve using the grid fins that are included on its main body to help control its orientation during flight to &#8220;catch&#8221; the booster — essentially hooking it using the launch tower arm before it touches the ground at all. The main benefit of this method, which will obviously involve a lot of precision maneuvering, is that it means <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can save both cost and weight by omitting landing legs from the Super Heavy design altogether.</p>
<p>Another potential benefit raised by Musk is that it could allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to essentially recycle the Super Heavy booster immediately back on the launch mount it returns to — possibly enabling it to be ready to fly again with a new payload and upper stage (consisting of Starship, the other spacecraft SpaceX is currently developing and testing) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344342598694047744">in &#8220;under an hour.&#8221;</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The goal for Starship and Super Heavy is to create a launch vehicle that&#8217;s even more reusable than SpaceX&#8217;s current Falcon 9 (and Falcon Heavy) system. Eventually, the goal for Musk is to have Starship making regular and frequent flights — for point-to-point flight on Earth, for orbital missions closer to home and for long-distance runs to the moon and Mars. The pace at which he envisions these happening in order to make it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/elon-musk-says-building-the-first-sustainable-city-on-mars-will-take-1000-starships-and-20-years/">possible to colonize Mars</a> with a continuous human population requires the kind of rapid recycling and reflying of Super Heavy he described today with this proposed new landing method.</p>
<p>Starship prototypes are currently being constructed and tested in Boca Chica, Texas, where SpaceX has been flying the pre-production spaceship during the past year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qatar-investment-authority" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qatar-investment-authority">Qatar Investment Authority <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is investing $125 million into energy storage systems integrator and power management tech developer, <a href="https://fluenceenergy.com/">Fluence</a>, in a deal that will value the company at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The joint venture between the American independent power producer, AES Corp. and the German industrial conglomerate <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/siemens" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="siemens">Siemens, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was already worth $900 million prior to the transaction, according to Marek Wolek, the vice president of strategy and partnerships at Fluence.</p>
<p>With the new cash, Fluence will look to develop and acquire software and services that can expand the company&#8217;s offerings to its core clients among utilities and independent power project developers, Wolek said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it might not be too long before the company seeks additional liquidity from the public markets, Wolek said. He noted that the QIA is already backing the battery company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quantumscape" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quantumscape">QuantumScape, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which was acquired by a special purpose acquisition company in late November and whose shares have been on a meteoric rise ever since.</p>
<p>After the QIA investment, AES and Siemens will remain majority shareholders. Each will hold a 44% stake in the company after the investment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe the global problem of climate change can only be tackled by leveraging the combined capabilities of technologists and investors from around the world,” said Manuel Perez Dubuc, Fluence’s chief executive officer, in a statement. “We see  energy storage as the linchpin of a decarbonized grid and adding QIA to our international shareholder base will allow Fluence to innovate even faster and address the enormous global market for large-scale battery-based energy storage.” </span></p>
<p>One of six founding members of the One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund Initiative, QIA is a multibillion dollar investment vehicle that has significant stores of capital to continue its support of climate tech companies like Fluence.</p>
<p>Fluence has already deployed roughly five gigawatts of energy storage and management systems to a wide array of customers, according to Wolek.</p>
<p>And while Wolek said Fluence sees itself and its energy storage business as a key component of the global decarbonization that needs to occur to combat climate change, electric storage isn&#8217;t the only technology that&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s difficult looking at the energy market and looking at one technology and saying that one technology is going to solve everything,&#8221; said Wolek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, the company&#8217;s role is to ensure that the battery technology Fluence is deploying can be integrated with the other technologies required to provide industry and society with the power it needs, he said. &#8220;We want to absolutely be the experts on battery-based storage,&#8221; Wolek said. &#8220;At the same time we do invest quite a bit on the digital side to expand our dispatch capabilities beyond storage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That could mean teaming up with other energy suppliers (like developers of hydrogen fuel projects) in the future, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to master the energy piece on the battery side,&#8221; Wolek said of the company&#8217;s ultimate goal.</p>
<p>That goal puts the company on something of a collision course with the energy business being built by Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla.</p>
<p>The billion-dollar valuation that Fluence currently enjoys and the $36.6 billion market cap that QuantumScape has goes some way toward explaining why Tesla can be considered to be a company worth over $650 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How do you make a virtual event accessible for people who are blind or visually impaired?</p>
<p>When I started work on <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFsNKNWWrvAlu-fjyNQxPZJ2lONg">Sight Tech Global </a>back in June this year, I was confident that we would find the answer to that question pretty quickly. With so many virtual event platforms and online ticketing options available to virtual event organizers, we were sure at least one would meet a reasonable standard of accessibility for people who use screen readers or other devices to navigate the Web.</p>
<p>Sadly, I was wrong about that. As I did my due diligence and spoke to CEOs at a variety of platforms, I heard a lot of “we’re studying <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsAxmyM2xJhZ4nGRz2bPNF_nIVww">WCAG</a> [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines] requirements” or “our developers are going to re-write our front-end code when we have time.” In other words, these operations, like many others on the Web, had not taken the trouble to code their sites for accessibility at the start, which is the least costly and fairest approach, not to mention the one compliant with the ADA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This realization was a major red flag. We had announced our event dates &#8211; Dec 2-3, 2020 &#8211; and there was no turning back. <a href="http://www.coherestudio.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.coherestudio.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLGGfK_smDxACwaunnPPvzBZLGFQ">Dmitry Paperny,</a> our designer, and I did not have much time to figure out a solution. No less important than the dates was the imperative that the event&#8217;s virtual experience work well for blind attendees, given that our event was really centered on that community.</p>
<p>We decided to take Occam’s razor to the conventions surrounding virtual event experiences and answer a key question: What was essential? Virtual event platforms tend to be feature heavy, which compounds accessibility problems. We ranked what really mattered, and the list came down to three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>live-stream video for the “main stage” events</li>
<li>a highly navigable, interactive agenda</li>
<li>interactive video for the breakout sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also debated adding a social or networking element as well, and decided that was optional unless there was an easy, compelling solution.</p>
<p>The next question was what third-party tools could we use? The very good news was that YouTube and Zoom get great marks for accessibility. People who are blind are familiar with both and many know the keyboard commands to navigate the players. We discovered this largely by word of mouth at first and then discovered ample supporting documentation at YouTube and Zoom. So we chose YouTube for our main stage programming and Zoom for our breakouts. It’s helpful, of course, that it’s very easy to incorporate both YouTube and Zoom in a website, which became our plan.</p>
<p>Where to host the overall experience, was the next question. We wanted to be able to direct attendees to a single URL in order to join the event. Luckily, we had already built an <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFsNKNWWrvAlu-fjyNQxPZJ2lONg">accessible website</a> to market the event. Dmitry had learned a lot in the course of designing and coding that site, including the importance of thinking about both blind and low-vision users. So we decided to add the event experience to our site itself &#8211; instead of using a third-party event platform &#8211; by adding two elements to the site navigation &#8211; Event (no longer live on the site) and <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJi_IzVmP5bQP3WLpr0nQH-VfXBQ">Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>The first amounted to a “page” (in WordPress parlance) that contained the YouTube live player embed, and beneath that text descriptions of the current session and the upcoming session, along with prominent links to the full Agenda. Some folks might ask, why place the agenda on a separate page? Doesn’t that make it more complicated? Good question, and the answer was one of many revelations that came from our partner <a href="https://makeitfable.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://makeitfable.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyeW7lmx2rv7ODDYkAN5i63WvQBQ">Fable</a>, which specializes in usability testing for people with disabilities. The answer, as we found time and again, was to imagine navigating with a screen reader, not your eyes. If the agenda were beneath the YouTube Player, it would create a cacophonous experience &#8211; imagine trying to listen to the programming and at the same time “read” (as in “listen to”) the agenda below. A separate page for the agenda was the right idea.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJi_IzVmP5bQP3WLpr0nQH-VfXBQ">Agenda page</a> was our biggest challenge because it contained a lot of information, required filters and also, during the show, had different “states” &#8211; as in which agenda items were “playing now” versus upcoming versus already concluded. Dmitry learned a lot about the best approach to drop downs for filters and other details to make the agenda page navigable, and we reviewed it several times with Fable’s experts. We decided nonetheless to take the fairly unprecedented step of inviting our registered, blind event attendees to join us for a “practice event” a few days before the show in order to get more feedback. Nearly 200 people showed up for two sessions. We also invited blind screen reader experts, including Fable’s Sam Proulx and Facebook’s Matt King, to join us to answer questions and sort out the feedback.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that there are three major screen readers: JAWS, which is used mostly by Windows’ users; VoiceOver, which is on all Apple products; and NVDA, which is open source and works on PCs running Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and later. They don’t all work in the same way, and the people who use them range from experts who know hundreds of keyboard commands to occasional users who have more basic skills. For that reason, it’s really important to have expert interlocutors who can help separate good suggestions from simple frustrations.</p>
<p>The format for our open house (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW97GKhUNzE" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DEW97GKhUNzE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwbL1p3xcg2ynqpFE6WLj7h4hc_w">session one</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYnEZIW3Pg" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DSIYnEZIW3Pg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmipA-g6FxiT33MeBhs3v9y8Y_8Q"> session two</a>) was a Zoom meeting, where we provided a briefing about the event and how the experience worked. Then we provided links to a working Event page (with a YouTube player active) and the Agenda page and asked people to give it a try and return to the Zoom session with feedback. Like so much else in this effort, the result was humbling. We had the basics down well, but we had missed some nuances, such as the best way to order information in an agenda item for someone who can only “hear” it versus “see” it. Fortunately, we had time to tune the agenda page a bit more before the show.</p>
<p>The practice session also reinforced that we had made a good move to offer live customer support during the show as a buffer for attendees who were less sophisticated in the use of screen readers. We partnered with <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bemyeyes.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_eec9RdC4waiDGltLk5Oig7apPw">Be My Eyes</a>, a mobile app that connects blind users to sighted helpers who use the blind person&#8217;s phone camera to help troubleshoot issues. It&#8217;s like having a friend look over your shoulder. We recruited 10 volunteers and trained them to be ready to answer questions about the event, and Be My Eyes put them at the top of the list for any calls related to Sight Tech Global, which was listed under the Be My Eyes “event’ section.  Our event host, the incomparable Will Butler, who happens to be a vice-president at Be My Eyes, regularly reminded attendees to use Be My Eyes if they needed help with the virtual experience.</p>
<p>A month out from the event, we were feeling confident enough that we decided to add a social interaction feature to the show. Word on the street was that <a href="https://www.sli.do/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sli.do/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF49un6NWWurdyQueKHVbmiIlj6xw">Slido’</a>s basic Q&amp;A features worked well with screen readers, and in fact Fable used the service for its projects. So we added Slido to the program. We did not embed a Slido widget beneath the YouTube player, which might have been a good solution for sighted participants, but instead added a link to each agenda session to a standalone Slido page, where attendees could add comments and ask questions without getting tangled in the agenda or the livestream.  The solution ended up working well, and we had more than 750 comments and questions on Slido during the show.</p>
<p>When Dec. 2 finally arrived, we were ready. But the best-laid plans often go awry, we were only minutes into the event when suddenly our live, closed-captioning broke. We decided to halt the show until we could bring that back up live, for the benefit of deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees. After much scrambling, captioning came back. (See more on captioning below).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the production worked well from a programming standpoint as well as accessibility. How did we do? Of the 2400+ registered attendees at the event, 45% said they planned to use screen readers. When we did a survey of those attendees immediately after the show, 95 replied and they gave the experience a 4.6/5 score. As far as the programming, our attendees (this time asked everyone &#8211; 157 replies) gave us a score of 4.7/5. Needless to say, we were delighted by those outcomes.</p>
<p>One other note concerned registration. At the outset, we also “heard” that one of the event registration platforms was “as good as it gets” for accessibility. We took that at face value, which was a mistake. We should have tested because comments for people trying to register as well as a low turnout of registration from blind people revealed after a few weeks that the registration site may have been better than the rest but was still really disappointing. It was painful, for example, to learn from one of our speakers that <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkX7BbU6SyC1_pRZLE_wNYJs-aug">alt tags</a> were missing from images (and there was no way to add them) and that the screen reader users had to tab through mountains of information in order to get to actionable links, such as “register.”</p>
<p>As we did with our approach to the website, we decided that the best course was to simplify. We added a <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/forms/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnpqSUo0DkJnXQ0DFl_qvv3ZiwPQ">Google Form</a> as an alternative registration option. These are highly accessible. We instantly saw our registrations increase strongly, particularly among blind people. We were chagrined to realize that our first choice for registration had been excluding the very people our event intended to include.</p>
<p>We were able to use the Google Forms option because the event was free. Had we been trying to collect payment of registration fees, Google Form would not have been an option. Why did we make the event free to all attendees? There are several reasons. First, given our ambitions to make the event global and easily available to anyone interested in blindness, it was difficult to arrive at a universally acceptable price point. Second, adding payment as well as a “log-in” feature to access the event itself would create another accessibility headache. With our approach, anyone with the link to the Agenda or Event page could attend without any log-in demand or registration. We knew this would create some leakage in terms of knowing who attended the event &#8211; quite a lot in fact because we had 30% more attendees than registrants &#8211; but given the nature of the event we thought that losing out on names and emails was an acceptable price to pay considering the accessibility benefit.</p>
<p>If there is an overarching lesson from this exercise, it’s simply this: Event organizers have to roll up their sleeves and really get to the bottom of whether the experience is accessible or not. It’s not enough to trust platform or technology vendors, unless they have standout reputations in the community, as YouTube and Zoom do. It’s as important to ensure that the site or platform is coded appropriately (to WCAG standards, and using a tool like Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031833000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZ1Jqb8b2rAMwyQaxDk3odb7gJbg">LightHouse</a>) as it is to do real-world testing to ensure that the actual, observable experience of blind and low-vision users is a good one. At the end of the day, that’s what counts the most.</p>
<p>A final footnote. Although our event focused on accessibility issues for people who are blind or have low vision, we were committed from the start to include captions for people who would benefit. We opted for the best quality outcome, which is still human (versus AI) captioners, and we worked with <a href="https://vitac.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vitac.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031833000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHb0S4Re61RWlzvmuWFulCv_c_N-Q">VITAC</a> to provide captions for the live Zoom and YouTube sessions and <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.3playmedia.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031833000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSq-adwPcGFv5lsyVgXfuFYRYnkw">3Play Media</a> for the on-demand versions and the transcripts, which are now part of the permanent record. We also heard requests for “plain text” (no mark-up) versions of the transcripts in an easily downloadable version for people who use Braille-readers. We supplied those, as well. You can see how all those resources came together on pages  <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/session/if-the-jetsons-had-screen-readers-would-they-be-using-keyboard-commands/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/session/if-the-jetsons-had-screen-readers-would-they-be-using-keyboard-commands/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609441031833000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmvxorSUDFPdQ0TXfN3RbVTuSdYg">like this one</a>, which contain all the information on a given session and are linked from the relevant section of the agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m working in the Bay Area on an H-1B visa and my employer won’t sponsor my green card. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I really want permanent residence, but I never won a Nobel prize; I’m single; and I don’t have a million dollars yet. However, I think I might qualify for an EB-2 NIW green card. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What can you share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— National in Napa</strong></p>
<p>Dear National:</p>
<p>Wonderful that you’re taking matters into your own hands! This is a complicated process, so the most important advice I can give you is to retain an experienced business immigration attorney to represent you and prepare and file your green card case.</p>
<p>For additional do’s and don’ts in U.S. immigration, please check out the recent podcast that my law firm partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I posted on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/049-never-do-this-in-immigration-family/">the commandments of immigration (and especially what to not do when it comes to visas and green cards)</a>.</p>
<p>This particular episode focuses on family-based green cards, but these recommendations are timeless and apply to individuals who are self-petitioning for employment-based green cards, such as the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for exceptional ability and the EB-1A for extraordinary ability. Our top recommendation in that podcast episode is to avoid DIY immigration, so definitely retain legal counsel!</p>
<p>Filing for an EB-2 NIW or any green card requires more than just filling out the appropriate forms. The process needs to be understood, as the law and legal requirements, and the analysis of whether and how you can best qualify is complicated.</p>
<p>With any immigration matter, one needs to have the resources to fully understand the process, the steps for applying, and the timing and deadlines. We want to always make sure that you always maintain legal status (never falling out of status) so that you can remain in the U.S. (and don’t have to leave).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This has been the year of the social organization. As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world and the United States, governments and a patchwork of nonprofits and volunteer organizations sprang into action, offering everything from food and medical supplies to children’s books and clothing to individuals and families struggling in the virus’s wake.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest divide though to getting people help has been digital — non-profits need to connect with their beneficiaries over the internet just as much as any retailer today. Unfortunately, tech talent is expensive and hard to find, particularly for often cash-strapped nonprofits.</p>
<p>That was part of the impetus for two Stanford seniors, Mary Zhu and Amay Aggarwal, to co-found <a href="https://www.developforgood.org">Develop for Good</a>, a matching service designed to connect motivated and ambitious undergrads in computer science, design and economics to nonprofits with specific projects that require expertise. They launched the network in March as the pandemic started spreading rapidly, and since then, the organization has itself started growing exponentially as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Develop for Good “was in response to [the pandemic], but at the same time, a lot of our peers were having their internships canceled, [and] a lot of companies were having hiring freezes,” Zhu explained. “People were also seeking opportunities to be able to develop their professional skills and develop their project experience.” This coincidence of needs among both students and nonprofits helped accelerate the matching that Develop for Good offers.</p>
<p>So far, the 501(c)(3) non-profit has coordinated more than 25,000 volunteer hours across groups like the Ronald McDonald House, UNICEF, the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), Easterseals, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Children, AARP and more. The program, which in its first batch focused on Zhu and Aggarwal’s network at Stanford, has since expanded to more than a dozen schools across the United States. The two first reached out to nonprofits through Stanford’s alumni network, although as the program’s reputation has grown, they have started getting inbound interest as well.</p>
<p>Volunteers take on a project for 5-10 hours per week for 10 weeks, typically in teams. Each team meets their nonprofit client at least weekly to ensure the project matches expectations. Typical projects include application development, data visualization, and web design. Most projects conclude at the end of the batch, although the founders note that some in-depth projects like product development can cross over into future batches. As the program has expanded, Zhu and Aggarwal have added a more formal mentorship component to the program to help guide students through their work.</p>
<p>Applications for the next batch starting in January are <a href="https://forms.gle/5Vbqzc8FwoMJRJTr7">currently open for students</a> (they’re due January 2nd, so get them in quick!). The founders told me that they are expecting 800 applications, and are likely going to be able to match about 200 volunteers to 32 projects. Applications are mostly about matching interests with potential programs for the best fit, rather than a purely competitive exercise. So far, the program has worked on 50 projects to date.</p>
<p>For this next batch, Amazon Web Services will sponsor a stipend for first-generation and low-income students to help defray the financial impact of volunteer work for some students. “Over the past cycle, a few people had to drop out because they said, ‘they&#8217;re unable to work for free because they&#8217;re having a lot of financial stress for their families’,” Aggarwal said. The new stipend is meant to help these students continue to volunteer while alleviating some of that financial burden.</p>
<p>Aggarwal said that two-thirds of the program’s volunteer developers and designers are female, and one-third are first-generation or low-income.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech got dragged into yet another irrelevant Congressional scuffle this week after President Trump agreed to sign a bipartisan pandemic relief package but continued to press for additional $2,000 checks that his party opposed during negotiations.</p>
<p>In tweets and other comments, Trump tied a push for the boosted relief payments to his entirely unrelated demand to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a critical but previously obscure law that protects internet companies from legal liability for user-generated content.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 &#8211; Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough! <a href="https://t.co/GMotstu7OI">https://t.co/GMotstu7OI</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1343998076084748288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The political situation was complicated further after Republicans in Georgia&#8217;s two extremely high-stakes runoff races <a href="https://www.axios.com/kelly-loeffler-stimulus-checks-covid-relief-9c2c4600-4258-4d0a-9ad1-658ab21f772c.html">sided with Trump over the additional checks</a> rather than the majority of Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p>In a move that&#8217;s more a political maneuver than a real stab at tech regulation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000176-b086-d162-a7ff-f18ef09e0000">introduced a new bill</a> late Tuesday linking the $2,000 payments Republicans previously blocked to an outright repeal of Section 230 — a proposal that&#8217;s sure to be doomed in Congress.</p>
<p>McConnell&#8217;s bill humors the president&#8217;s eclectic cluster of demands while creating an opportunity for his party to look unified, sort of, in the face of the Georgia situation. The proposal also tosses in a study on voter fraud, not because it&#8217;s relevant but because it&#8217;s another pet issue that Trump dragged into the whole mess.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2020, Trump has repeatedly returned to the ideal of revoking Section 230 protections as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">cudgel he can wield against tech companies</a>, particularly Twitter when the platform&#8217;s rules result in his own tweets being down-ranked or paired with misinformation warnings.</p>
<p>If the latest development sounds confusing, that&#8217;s because it is. Section 230 and the stimulus legislation have nothing at all to do with one another. And we were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">just talking about Section 230</a> in relation to another completely unrelated bit of legislation, a huge annual defense spending bill called the NDAA.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump&#8217;s odd new attack on Section 230 is probably doomed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/embed/#?secret=yP2lffKhVJ" data-secret="yP2lffKhVJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/trump-ndaa-veto-section-230/">Trump decided to veto that bill</a>, which enjoyed broad bipartisan support because it funds the military and does other mostly uncontroversial stuff, on the grounds that it didn&#8217;t include his totally unrelated demand to strip tech companies of their Section 230 protections. Trump&#8217;s move was pretty much out of left field, but it opened the door for Democrats to leverage their cooperation in a two-thirds majority to override Trump&#8217;s veto for other stuff they want right now, namely those $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans. Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/28/bernie-sanders-filibuster-delay-defense-veto-override-451697">is attempting to do just that</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, McConnell&#8217;s move here is mostly a cynical one, to the detriment of Americans in financial turmoil. An outright repeal of Section 230 is a position without much, if any, support among Democrats. And while closely Trump-aligned Republicans have flirted with the idea of stripping online platforms of the legal shield altogether, some flavor of reform is what&#8217;s been on the table and what&#8217;s likely to get hashed out in 2021.</p>
<p>For lawmakers who understand the far-reaching implications of the law, reform rather than a straight-up repeal was always a more likely outcome. In the extraordinarily unlikely event that Section 230 gets repealed through this week&#8217;s strange series of events, many of the websites, apps and online services that people rely on would be thrown into chaos. Without Section 230&#8217;s liability protections, websites from Yelp to Fox News would be legally responsible for any user-generated reviews and comments they host. If an end to comments sections doesn&#8217;t sound so bad, imagine an internet without Amazon reviews, tweets and many other byproducts of the social internet.</p>

<p>The thing is, it&#8217;s not going to happen. McConnell doesn&#8217;t want Americans to receive the additional $2,000 checks and Democrats aren&#8217;t going to be willing to secure the funds by agreeing to a totally unrelated last-minute proposal to throw out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">the rules of the internet</a>, particularly with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">regulatory pressure on tech mounting</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/">more serious 230 reform efforts</a> still underway. The proposed bill is also not even guaranteed to come up for a vote in the waning days of this Congressional session.</p>
<p>The end result will be that McConnell humors the president by offering him what he wanted (kind of), Democrats look bad for suddenly opposing much-needed additional stimulus money and Americans in the midst of a deadly and financially devastating crisis probably don&#8217;t end up with more money in their pockets. Not great.</p>
