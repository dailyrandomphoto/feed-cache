										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employee leave benefits are a complicated web of company and government policies, and <a href="http://www.meetcocoon.com/">Cocoon</a> is out to bring clarity and simplicity to both the employer and employee experience.</p>
<p>The platform launched Wednesday across all 50 states and is designed for any type of employee leave, like parental, medical, caregiver or bereavement. It factors in all company government and insurance benefits and manages all facets of the leave from compliance to claims management to payroll calculations.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch, the San Francisco-based company announced it raised a $20 million Series A funding led by Index Ventures, with participation from First Round Capital, SemperVirens, XYZ, Magnify Ventures and a group of individual investors. This brings the company’s total funding to $26 million, co-founder and CEO Mahima Chawla told TechCrunch. This includes a $5.5 million seed round with Index and First Round in December 2020.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oyster snaps up $20M for its HR platform aimed at distributed workforces&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/embed/#?secret=aDaJ95UvF6" data-secret="aDaJ95UvF6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chawla, Lauren Dai and Amber Feng founded the company in June 2020. The idea for the company stemmed from a conversation Chawla and Dai had with co-workers and friends about leave benefits. They thought, at the time, that leave was similar to putting an out-of-office on your calendar, but as they learned that it was more about navigating company, government and insurance laws, especially around how it worked at a particular company, who pays during a leave and how it works, they saw a need to simplify the experience.</p>
<p>“Even extremely benefit-friendly companies are having a hard time,” Chawla said. “We talked to hundreds of employees and HR managers across all industries, and to everyone, it is a nightmare. We thought it shouldn’t be hard for someone to take care of themselves. This impacts everyone, but there is not something to make it easier, so we saw a big opportunity to make an impact.”</p>
<p>Cocoon’s platform has areas for both employers and employees. On the employer side, it handles compliance and payroll complexities so that the company knows what its payroll responsibilities are, but takes all of that work off of the employer’s plate. The employee will go on Cocoon and design a leave from beginning to end via an automated process that Chawla said can be done in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Since its launch in January, the platform has collected a rich set of data, including how employees are using their leave benefits and what they are taking it for to create insights for employers to understand how better to craft their benefits.</p>
<p>Cocoon is already working with large employers, like Carta, and Chawla sees its responsibility as taking the pain out of leave. Other companies in the benefits space are coming at the problem of leave in a more piecemeal way, while Cocoon is taking a holistic approach and applying software and automation to reduce the amount of back-and-forth both employers and employees have to do when managing leave.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used for hiring, particularly in engineering, sales and customer success and building out additional products.</p>
<p>“We are seeing massive inbound inquiries through customer referrals and broker relations,” Chawla said. “Next year, it will not just be about expanding the base of employers, but also moving into different industries and employers of different sizes.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Mark Goldberg, partner at Index Ventures, has joined the company’s board of directors. He says this investment was a personal one for him as he was finishing up a paternal leave and helped write the leave policy for the firm. In fact, one of his colleagues spent over 25 hours on the phone with California’s Employment Development Department during the initial part of her maternity leave trying to navigate a clerical error that threatened her job.</p>
<p>Goldberg has known the Cocoon team for a while, following the co-founders from their previous respective positions at Square and Stripe.</p>
<p>“When Mahima called me and said the band was coming together, I wanted to get involved,” he added. “We are looking for that core talent vortex. If you can get the DNA in the first 10 employees, the next 100 will be top-notch. It’s similar to what we saw in the early Plaid team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Russian authorities have arrested and detained Ilya Sachkov, the co-founder and chief executive of Group-IB — one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the country — on charges of treason.</p>
<p>Details about Sachkov&#8217;s detention remain unclear but it was reported by Russian media as authorities searched the company&#8217;s offices, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/moscow-office-group-ib-cybersecurity-firm-searched-by-police-company-2021-09-29/">reports Reuters</a>. State news agency Tass said Sachkov, who was arrested on Tuesday, was charged with allegedly transferring classified information to an unnamed foreign government, claims that Sachkov denied, according <a href="https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/12533055">to the report</a>.</p>
<p>Group-IB confirmed the arrest of its CEO, but a spokesperson for Group-IB did not comment beyond a statement on the company&#8217;s website, which said the company is examining the Moscow court&#8217;s decision and that it is &#8220;confident&#8221; in Sachkov&#8217;s innocence.</p>
<p>In the statement, Group-IB said that co-founder Dmitry Volkov will run the company in Sachkov&#8217;s absence, who will be detained for at least two months per the court&#8217;s order. &#8220;All of Group-IB’s divisions will continue operating as usual,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not comment on the claims made in the Tass news report. A treason conviction can be punishable by up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Sachkov, 35, founded Group-IB in 2003. The company, now headquartered in Singapore, helps companies and governments investigate cyberattacks and online fraud, and has customers ranging from Interpol to Russian banks and defense companies.</p>
<p>In 2018, Group-IB moved its headquarters to Singapore after the U.S. government accused Moscow of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/justice-department-charges-fancy-bear-hacking/">meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election</a>. Sachkov said at the time the company would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-group-ib/russian-cybersecurity-firm-group-ib-to-open-global-hq-in-singapore-ceo-idUSKCN1NH0IT">invest $30 million</a> in the new headquarters and bring on 90 new employees. Sachkov has been critical of the Russian government <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/a-russian-cyber-guru-finds-ways-to-distance-company-from-kremlin">in the past</a>, and said moving to Singapore is part of the company&#8217;s efforts to grow its business and remain independent.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/group-ib-nikita-kislitsin-indicted-formspring-nikulin/">a 2014 indictment</a> of Nikita Kislitsin, which alleged he was involved in a conspiracy to sell credentials stolen from Formspring in 2012 before joining Group-IB&#8217;s as its head of network security. U.S. prosecutors did not accuse Group-IB of foul play, but the company defended Kislitsin saying that it had &#8220;no findings&#8221; that he had engaged in wrongdoing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="column-55 w-col w-col-6">
<p id="speakable-summary">Energize Ventures, an early and growth-stage venture fund, has announced the closing of its second fund with total capital commitments of $330 million. Fund II will be used to help scale and commercialize software across renewable energy, mobility, cybersecurity, battery storage, critical infrastructure and climate resiliency.</p>
</div>
<p>The fund, which is worth exactly double what Energize raised for its first fund, is backed by anchor investors such as Invenergy, CDPQ, SE Ventures, GE Renewable Energy and Hannon Armstrong. Credit Suisse, Xcel Energy, American Electric Power and Equinor Ventures also participated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we first launched Energize five years ago, we have seen the energy and industrial sectors undergo a massive digital transformation,&#8221; said John Tough, managing partner of Energize Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;The transition towards a more renewable and sustainable future is outpacing all expectations, and market participants are digitizing operations to address this new, emerging scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="column-55 w-col w-col-6">
<p>To date, Energize has deployed capital from Fund II into three investments, including Munich-based predictive battery analytics software TWAICE, Columbus, Ohio-based IoT device company Finite State and New York-based critical infrastructure cybersecurity company Urbint, according to the firm.</p>
<p>Fund II is targeting 15 or more early-stage digital-first startups that are raising Series A, B or C rounds in the energy and sustainable industry sectors. Typically, Energize Ventures invests around $10 million to $20 million and prefers to lead the round.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s first round invested in 14 software-based companies, including the now-public EV charging solution Volta, cloud manufacturing startup Fast Radius and solar software company Aurora Solar.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Energize exclusively invests in digital solutions,&#8221; a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. &#8220;That means no hardware, no moonshots that require untold amounts of capex to get off the ground – just technologies at the software layer at commercialization. Part of that comes from the firm’s investment strategy; the team leans on its LPs (including well-known corporates such as GE and Schneider) to identify the challenges facing the sectors today, and then finds solutions that overcome those barriers to decarbonization.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stock options can hold a lot of potential reward for employees when their company is doing well, but not every person will have the funds to fully exercise &#8212; that is, buy up &#8212; the options they have available to them. Enter <a href="https://equitybee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EquityBee</a>, a marketplace for employees to connect with capital from a network of some 12,000 investors to finance the process. The startup has been on a growth tear this year, and to continue building out features on its platform, and expanding its reach, the company today is announcing $55 million in equity funding of its own.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Group 11, with Battery Ventures, Latitude, Local Globe, Greenfield Partners and ICON also participating. Exact valuation is not being disclosed, but Oren Barzilai, EquityBee&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said it was in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The funding is coming amid a lot of investor buzz (pun intended) around in the Tel Aviv/Palo Alto-based startup: EquityBee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/equitybee-raises-20m-to-help-startup-employees-actually-afford-their-stock-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $20 million</a> only seven months ago. And in the process of working on this story, this latest round was bumped up by $7 million.</p>
<p>EquityBee is filling an interesting, often under-the-radar gap in the world of stock options. Many tech employees &#8212; especially those at startups &#8212; calculate options as part of their remuneration packages (and indeed, when options are not an option, that can be <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28561054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial</a>). Indeed, in the U.S. alone there are some 6 million startup employees today that have some form of equity.</p>
<p>But in a lot of cases, employees aren&#8217;t fully able to take advantage of what they can on the options front, because buying them up can be costly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average employee needs $140,000 in cash to exercise fully,&#8221; Barzilai said. In total he estimates that there is up to $60 billion swimming around in stock options annually among startups, but that more than 55% of that goes unexercised every year. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big amount that they are losing,&#8221; he said of employees who are missing out.</p>
<p>On the other side of the EquityBee marketplace, there is a huge repository of cash ready to invest in the startup economy, and those holding the pursestrings are regularly looking for ways of diversifying how they invest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Investors [in the network] are getting great access to invest in these companies by providing the funding for options,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s not a loan, it’s an investment.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The idea is that employees put their funding request on to the platform, and investors essentially bid to finance it. The funding can come in the form of a syndicate, or a single individual. In the case both of the investor and the employee who will get the funds, neither will know direct identities, although investors are able to see which company the employee works for, so theoretically the investor can apply some judgement around whether it&#8217;s a great or risky bet.</p>
<p>Employees are not required to pay back the money until a liquidity event impacts those options, and they only have to pay back the primary money, plus percentage interest, if they make any money on those options. This means that if the stock options end up being worthless, the investor loses money, but the employee owes nothing. If the company has a great exit, the employee pays back the funding with interest. But also: if the company has only a middling outcome, and an employee gets some but not a great payout on those options, that too triggers a payout to the investor. In other words, none of this is a sure thing, but for employees and investors who are willing to take a chance on options, it&#8217;s an interesting way to help both sides play in the game.</p>
<p>So far, EquityBee has found some strong traction in the startup investment ecosystem. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Capital in its Investor Network &#8212; which includes family offices, funds, high net-worth individuals, and increasingly, Barzilai tells me, VCs &#8212; has seen 500% year-on-year growth since 2020, and the number of players in that network has grown by 430% &#8212; two signs investors interested in getting involved. Meanwhile, the number of employees tapping that network has grown by more than 350% in the same period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Barzilai said that at the moment EquityBee does not have any formal partnerships with the companies that are issuing the options &#8212; &#8220;</span>Our mission is to empower all startup employees to take part in the success that they helped to build,&#8221; he said of its target audience &#8212; but he notes that many of them recommend EquityBee informally to their employees who need financial help to exercise their options; and you can imagine EquityBee formalizing some of that as part of wider suite of benefits and HR services that companies offer.</p>
<p>Indeed, with options continuing to remain a strong force in how startups are built, and how employees are getting a share in their employers&#8217; success, there are likely going to be more enhancements to what EquityBee can offer to employees using its marketplace for financing. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Barzilai would not be drawn out on future features but notes that there is an opportunity to provide other kinds of liquidity &#8212; that is, cash &#8212; to employees against the value of their options, in cases where they may not be vesting them any time soon. It&#8217;s also why we are seeing other startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/vested-a-newly-minted-startup-aims-to-help-startup-employees-understand-precisely-when-to-buy-their-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vested</a>, also emerging to provide other kinds of services,to these employees to help them manage their assets in a better way. That, too, also speaks to future services that EquityBee could also offer.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After leading <span class="il">EquityBee</span>&#8216;s Seed and Series A rounds, we have witnessed the company&#8217;s continued triple-digit growth over the past year. The extraordinary founding team has demonstrated a great product-market fit, and their work continues to distance <span class="il">EquityBee</span> as a true market leader,&#8221; said Dovi Frances, Founding Partner of Group 11, in a statement. &#8220;<span class="il">EquityBee</span>&#8216;s industry-defining tech solutions will help millions of tech employees gain access to liquidity in a market otherwise set up against them. Our decision to scale our investment so soon after our previous round is an easy one and we are pleased to continue supporting the company and its unprecedented growth.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Joyned turns retailer websites into mini social media platforms where shoppers can show friends their potential purchases and shop together without leaving the site.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.joyned.co/">Joyned</a>, formerly known as <a href="https://www.gamitee.com/">Gamitee</a>, announced Wednesday that it raised $4 million in seed funding to continue developing its e-commerce platform that puts merchants in the driver’s seat of social engagement.</p>
<p>CEO Jonathan Abraham explained that Gamitee means “joined” in Hebrew, but the Jerusalem-based SaaS company decided to spell it “joy” because it aims to “spark joy in its customers’ experiences.”</p>
<p>Leading the round is Arthur Stark, former president of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Yair Goldfinger, founder of Dotomi and ICQ, and Rafael Ashkenazi, managing director and executive chairman at Hard Rock Digital.</p>
<p>“Arthur is a legend in retail, and he is helping us a lot in the U.S. market,” Abraham said. “Yari was the first to build a messaging app, and with Rafael we will penetrate the U.S. market and build our brand there.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Livestream video shopping app NTWRK raises $50M from Goldman Sachs, Kering&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/livestream-video-shopping-app-ntwrk-raises-50m-from-goldman-sachs-kering/embed/#?secret=EsauhJqb3F" data-secret="EsauhJqb3F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rather than helping e-commerce companies do a better job advertising on social media, Joyned enables retailers to offer a collaborative shopping platform experience right from their websites without having to rely on the social media platforms, Abraham said. Now shoppers can stay on a retailer site and bring in friends to check out products with the click of a button.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Abraham came up with the idea for the company four years ago while planning his wedding. He had to pick out a suit to wear, and after appointing family members to help, his life became inundated with suit options and his computer had hundreds of tabs open. That’s when he had the idea for co-browsing and began developing the company with co-founder Michael Levinson.</p>
<p>Though co-browsing is not a new concept — Abraham said Netscape, Google and Zoom all attempted or did something similar to create collaboration on the web — Joyned is doing something more specific.</p>
<p>Using the company’s technology, a merchant can inject some Javascript into their website, essentially a plug-and-play for Shopify and other websites, and it will put a “shop with me” button on the website where the shopper can invite friends to a shared shopping cart, mood board and speak with the merchants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The essence of joy is to empower merchants to own their shopping experience and let people shop together,” he added. “Joyned puts the social part into online shopping and narrows the gap between online and offline.”</p>
<p>Using Joyned, retailers are able to lower customer acquisition costs, optimize conversion rates and build loyalty. On average, retailers can expect overall sales increases of between 6% and 15% after users invite friends to join them, while also experiencing up to 250% in retention rates and a 40% increase in traffic, according to Abraham.</p>
<p>The new capital will lay the foundation for Joyned’s large-scale U.S. expansion, where the company is already seeing impact. The company wants to build on its marketing team in Florida and add sales and support functions.</p>
<p>Over the last year, the company launched its platform and saw sales grow rapidly, close to $500,000 and is on target to hit $1 million in sales, Abraham said.</p>
<p>Looking forward, Joyned will be going after a Series A as it closes three or four major brands in the U.S. to begin using the platform.</p>
<p>“Today, social media marketing is making big companies exist, but merchants are dependent on it,” Abraham added. “Instead of having a blackbox of engagements, we are bringing a new perspective that gives merchants the ability to go into the black box, and that gives them a huge competitive advantage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13108-Tourist-services-short-term-rental-initiative_en">consulting</a> on how to regulate the short term rental market across the bloc &#8212; asking whether a single set of pan-EU rules or something more locally flavored is needed to rule over platforms like Airbnb.</p>
<p>The Commission says it wants to support an expansion of competition and players in the sector but also respect EU law which allows for Member States to apply local rules based on concerns that are in the public interest.</p>
<p>As it stands, a patchwork of rules and regulations has grown up around short term rental platforms across Europe as cities grapple with the impact of over-tourism from uncontrolled growth of Airbnb et al &#8212; and also struggle to extract useful data from platforms whose business model benefits from flipping local housing stock to drive short term rental gains.</p>
<p>This dynamic is triggering the Commission&#8217;s customary anxiety around fragmentation of the Single Market. So it&#8217;s now <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13108-Tourist-services-short-term-rental-initiative_en">asking for views</a> from the industry and interested citizens as it considers whether a sector-specific regulation is needed.</p>
<p>In a summary of its intention for the forthcoming short term rental (STR) initiative, which will be fed by responses to the public consultation, the Commission writes that its aim i<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">s &#8220;to develop responsible, fair and trusted growth in short-term rentals, as part of a well-balanced tourist ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; and &#8220;ensure a level playing field for all accommodation service providers and to respond to the many requests from interested parties for EU-wide action in this area&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This will involve offering balanced solutions for cities, peer and professional short-term rental providers and platforms, while benefiting in particular small and medium-sized firms,&#8221; it adds.</span></p>
<p>The Commission proposed broad rules for the digital sector at the back end of last year &#8212; under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a> &#8212; which it has said will level the playing fields between online and offline business in areas such as illegal content and goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However the regulation has been criticized for not going far enough to tackle illegal holiday rentals.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FRs5kuJCUS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">Paris court fines Airbnb $9.6 million for illegal listings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Paris court fines Airbnb $9.6 million for illegal listings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/embed/#?secret=FRs5kuJCUS" data-secret="FRs5kuJCUS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aworldworthexperiencing.com/booking-coms-position-on-the-digital-services-act-febb47af6a87">position paper</a> earlier this year, for example, the holiday accommodation booking platform, Booking.com, wrote that the Commission&#8217;s proposal could be more &#8220;ambitious&#8221; &#8212; saying it &#8220;insufficiently addresses illegal short term holiday rentals&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The powers for national (or local) authorities to order platforms to remove illegal content (Article 8) and to share information (Article 9) are a step in the right direction. However, enforcement loopholes remain,&#8221; it added. &#8220;Where short term vacation rentals are subject to an authorization /registration scheme, platforms should be required to ensure that only properly registered / authorized properties are listed. This is in line with the duty of care incumbent upon platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission is also facing vocal pressure on the issue from heavily touristed cities across Europe &#8212; which have been trying to impose limits on the growth of holiday rentals, with mixed success.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/court-overturns-amsterdams-three-district-ban-on-airbnb-rentals/">Earlier this year</a>, for example, a court in Amsterdam overturned a three-district ban on rentals on platforms like Airbnb which the city authorities had brought in after polling local residents over the impacts on their communities.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">this summer</a> city authorities in Paris trumpeted winning a major case against Airbnb &#8212; which was ordered to pay $9.6M for illegal listings.</p>
<p>Governments in Europe have also been <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/dutch-deputy-prime-minister-calls-for-digital-services-act-regulation-against-airbnb/">pressing</a> the Commission to regulate for data access to vacation rental platforms, with the Dutch suggesting last year that it should embed such provisions in the DSA.</p>
<p>The European Parliament has also warned that the &#8220;expansive growth of short-term holiday rental in cities and popular tourist destinations is extracting housing from the market, driving up prices and has a negative impact on liveability&#8221;. And in a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0247_EN.html">report</a> last year MEPs also said: &#8220;We want to give cities more control over rentals short term accommodation platforms and ensure that these platforms share information with the cities, respecting data protection rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/airbnb-and-three-other-p2p-rental-platforms-agree-to-share-limited-pan-eu-data/">last year</a> the Commission inked a voluntary agreement with a handful of major platforms to push some aggregated data. However the agreement goes considerably less far than requirements that some individual European cities have imposed on STR platforms operating locally in a bid to control their impacts on communities.</p>
<p>In its consultation on the STR issue, the Commission notes that a number of authorities across the EU have taken steps to try to regulate short term rentals (STRs) &#8212; such as by imposing registration requirements and authorisation schemes on hosts, and by putting limits on the number of nights per year properties can be rented out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst doing so, some national rules make a difference between so-called ‘peers’ offering STRs in a private capacity occasionally, and those offering STRs in a more professional capacity,&#8221; it goes on. &#8220;Criteria differ however and not everywhere a distinction is made between peers and professionals. Authorities have also taken a variety of measures to obtain better data from platforms, with a view to better assessing the volume of STRs and facilitating law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The foregoing has resulted in a <a title="See i.a. Oxford Research, Study on national regulatory approaches to short-term accommodation services, 2021 (forthcoming); European Commission, Spark Legal Network, VVA, Study on the assessment of the regulatory aspects affecting the collaborative economy in the tourism accommodation sector in the 28 Member States, 2018, available at: Study on regulations affecting the collaborative short-term accommodation sector in the EU | Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (europa.eu)." href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/study-regulations-affecting-collaborative-short-term-accommodation-sector-eu_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patchwork of varying rules and regulations</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under EU law, imposing restrictions and conditions on the provision of a service can be justified if necessary to pursue a legitimate public interest objective and proportionate to achieve that end. In spite of important clarifications offered by EU case law, there is still much uncertainty regarding the measures authorities may adopt and enforce as regards hosts and other service providers such as platforms,&#8221; the Commission adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;EU horizontal regulatory initiatives such as the Digital Services Act aim to impose harmonised obligations on online platforms, including collaborative economy platforms in the area of STRs. However, in order to foster a balanced development of the STR segment in the EU and to address the sector-specific aspects, a dedicated sector-specific initiative may be needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly where the Commission will plant its flag on this contentious issue &#8212; but its consultation poses a number of questions for stakeholders to respond to in areas such as transparency and data access, as well as asking for views on the benefits and drawbacks of STRs.</p>
<p>The Commission is also seeking suggestions for specific rules and regulations that might be applied to STRs to achieve the sought for balance between supporting tourism and respecting local public interest &#8212; including asking for views on how best to ascertain whether an STR host is a &#8216;peer&#8217; or a professional operator.</p>
<p>The marketing of platforms like Airbnb typically spins the promise that you&#8217;re renting unique and characterful spaces from locals &#8212; which differentiates the holiday rental platform business from more traditional tourist fare like hotels.</p>
<p>However the reality of such &#8216;p2p&#8217; platforms is they quickly attracted a swathe of professional landlords &#8212; who could lucratively list and rent entire apartments to tourists, instead of renting the housing at a lower rate to locals on long term contracts. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hence the criticism that STRs hollow out local communities and make city living less affordable for locals. </span></p>
<p>In one question from the Commission&#8217;s public consultation &#8212; which is asking for views on the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">type of rules and requirements for STRs that &#8220;could be acceptable&#8221; &#8212; it suggests a number of responses, including registration and authorization obligations on all hosts or only on professional hosts; and limits on the number of nights, amount of income generated and number of rooms that can be rented by peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the end of this list it also asks for a response to the suggestion of a &#8220;total ban on STRs&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Elsewhere, the consultation asks for views on whether rules for STRs should be imposed from the top (a &#8220;harmonized EU approach) &#8212; or allowed to be entirely bottom up (left to local authorities to define) or some vaguely defined combination of the two.</p>
<p>It is also concerned with whether there should be different rules for peers and professional hosts &#8212; and if so how best to define who is a peer and who a professional?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other questions in the consultation ask for views on </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">measures &#8220;that you think could support innovation in the STR and the development of new business models&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s consultation runs until December 13, with the EU&#8217;s executive slated to publish a legislative proposal for vacation rentals in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As internet creators and influencers grow their followings, it&#8217;s not always intuitive what the best way to monetize might be. For some creators, they might find a path to monetization through subscriber-only content and branded posts, but for those with a great idea and an entrepreneurial streak, they might leverage their appeal to launch a product.</p>
<p><a href="https://cobalt.co/">Cobalt</a> helps creators turn their ideas into something they can sell, whether it&#8217;s a custom product that doesn&#8217;t exist yet or a specialty blend of perfume. Creators can use Cobalt&#8217;s marketplace to connect with over 250 vetted experts in fields like design, sourcing, manufacturing, engineering and business. For those who want to design a custom product, like a tech-free <a href="https://nugandtater.com/">children&#8217;s entertainment system</a>, it costs $1000 to get the product designed through Cobalt. For creators seeking private label products, it costs $100 to hire a Cobalt expert to do sourcing for you. So far, in beta, founder and CEO Elle Shelley Black says that about 80% of 200 products in production are custom. Over 7,000 more prospective entrepreneurs have signed up for Cobalt&#8217;s waitlist, which will end today as the product comes out of private beta for public availability.</p>

<p>These products go beyond an influencer moneygrab &#8212; Cobalt is deliberately not developing apparel products, since Black is concerned about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html?.?mc=aud_dev&amp;ad-keywords=auddevgate&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-sqKBhBjEiwAVaQ9az__UfpC7vFKPH-aKB7lGyoirGapRnYh_IcPS7gwoEVXBw6WzZTQMxoClvUQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">environmental impact</a> of fast fashion. One example of a custom product is a mask for horses to protect them from wildfire smoke &#8212; the creator is an avid horseback rider concerned about her animals&#8217; health due to California wildfires. Black also pointed to Jenna Smith, who sells hydroponic small-batch produce through her startup <a href="https://www.growcery.farm/">Growcery</a>, which she developed via Cobalt.</p>
<p>Creators pay an additional 10% platform fee on transactions, while experts pay a 5% service fee to use Cobalt. For the experts, this is significantly smaller than that of platforms like Fiverr, which <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/start_selling">take 20%</a> of payments. Once a creator develops their product and begins to sell it, Cobalt doesn&#8217;t take a cut from their sales.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those price points feel really affordable to me,&#8221; Black told TechCrunch. &#8220;Through Cobalt, it&#8217;s free to create an account, and creators can talk directly to sourcing agents and experts for free. And so even that discovery of DMing or messaging people in the platform is really valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>In theory, once a creator makes connections via Cobalt, it could be possible for them to forego the platform fees and collaborate outside of Cobalt. But Black thinks that the convenience of the product will keep creators around after their first product launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made the payment and invoicing so easy,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do it through Venmo &#8212; how do you pay your vendors $10,000 overseas?&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/pietra-raises-15m-from-founders-fund-to-help-creators-launch-their-own-product-lines/">Pietra</a> are cropping up to turn TikTok stars into business moguls, but Cobalt differentiates itself by investing in Latin American manufacturers, which Cobalt vets to make sure they follow ethical practices. As a Latinx founder herself, Black made sure to build her company by working with other underrepresented people in tech &#8212; she said that 85% of Cobalt&#8217;s investors come from underrepresented backgrounds. In Cobalt&#8217;s $2.8 million seed round, a strategic partner is <a href="https://www.haiatyamezcua.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.haiatyamezcua.net/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632938862546000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwzGLExO4tVjV2av5pCaR5k5HsAg">A&amp;H Haiat y Amezcua</a>, a fund from Mexico City that helped IKEA scale in Latin and Central America.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;re looking at is how do we reduce the cost in supply chain, how do we reduce the friction, how do we insist on using sustainable materials, and how do we find and connect as many ethical manufacturers to the platform as possible,&#8221; Black told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really started focusing on Latin America, and within that, Mexico specifically. It&#8217;s more efficient for a lot of reasons. Number one, they&#8217;re already on the same continent. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re really going to start, and really look at humane working conditions before we allow manufacturers to come into the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">With the funding, Cobalt hopes to get the product to market and continue building out creator tools. Today, Cobalt launches out of beta and is available to the public.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CEO Jeremy Johnson sees more competition coming into the global tech talent hiring space as he saw the number of Andela applicants increase 5x in the past six months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a fully remote company that helps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/andela-a-tech-training-and-development-outsourcer-for-african-coders-raises-40m/">tech companies build remote engineering teams</a> (initially from Africa but now a global market), is currently valued at $1.5 billion following a $200 million Series E round led by SoftBank’s <a href="https://visionfund.com/">Softbank Vision Fund 2</a>, the $30 billion venture fund of SoftBank Group.</p>
<p>Joining SoftBank in the investment was new investor Whale Rock and existing investors including Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Spark Capital.</p>
<p>After closing this Series E round, Andela has raised a total of $381 million since being founded in Lagos, Nigeria in 2014, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andela/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>. Its last valuation of $700 million came when the company raised a $100 million Series D in 2019.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Lydia Jett, founding partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, will join Andela’s board. In a written statement, Jett said that “hiring remote technical talent is one of the top challenges that companies face today, and we believe Andela will become the preferred talent partner for the world’s best companies as remote and hybrid work arrangements become the norm.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/andela-begins-global-expansion-in-37-countries-months-after-going-remote-across-africa/">began a global expansion</a> earlier this year following a regional one last year during the pandemic. The action coincided with Andela&#8217;s fully remote policy in a bid to tap into a talent pool of over 500,000 engineers in the coming years.</p>
<p>Up from seven African countries and 37 at the beginning of the global expansion, Andela now has engineers in more than 80 countries today, CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch. It also boasts a client list of over 200 that includes GitHub, Cloudflare and ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>To Johnson, working with SoftBank means more acceleration of what the company is doing now, especially as the world has become more comfortable with remote work. Andela evaluates technical and soft skills of engineers and matches them with the teams that most closely fit.</p>
<p>“Remote is why Andela has worked in the first place,” he added. “In some ways, it is also a stamp of approval that top tech companies are looking for remote approaches to building engineering teams and sourcing talent. We hear from SoftBank, and others, that finding tech talent is tough. Andela becomes pushing the easy button on all of that.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Andela begins global expansion in 37 countries months after going remote across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/andela-begins-global-expansion-in-37-countries-months-after-going-remote-across-africa/embed/#?secret=NuRAX2qP1s" data-secret="NuRAX2qP1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Andela has over 300 employees and will use the new capital to add to that workforce, particularly in product, engineering and growth, Johnson said. In addition, the company is investing in growth, continued expansion of technology and product development and M&amp;A.</p>
<p>While he doesn’t have specific acquisition targets at the moment, Johnson did say Andela was looking for talent networks to expand geographically or in terms of client and talent bases, as well as technology to enable it to better source and access talent while also managing delivery.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of moving pieces, so additional technology to do that faster is always interesting,” he added. “In the process, we are moving into AI as a part of that.”</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/freelancer-marketplace-toptal-sues-andela-and-ex-employees-alleging-theft-of-trade-secrets/">Andela and several of its employees were sued by freelancer marketplace Toptal</a>. The lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, alleges the theft of trade secrets in pursuit of “a perfect clone of its business,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The complaint also alleged interference with contract, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>
<p>Despite the allegations, Johnson noted that there has not been movement there. He considers the lawsuit as “the price you pay for doing things that matter,” and that it was a tactic to scare employees.</p>
<p>“If they were serious about damages, they would be trying to settle, but they just want it to drag on,” he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freelancer marketplace Toptal sues Andela and ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/freelancer-marketplace-toptal-sues-andela-and-ex-employees-alleging-theft-of-trade-secrets/embed/#?secret=pqH5xe4mdl" data-secret="pqH5xe4mdl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the company has attracted some big investors, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/andela-begins-global-expansion-in-37-countries-months-after-going-remote-across-africa/">continued to struggle with its business model</a>, including laying off employees in 2019 even after raising a $100 million Series D. Its pivot to being a global technology network from its African roots as a talent accelerator was not to find favor with investors, but “the journey of finding ourselves, similar as all startups go through,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>An early investor in the company, Idris Ayo Bello, the managing partner at Africa-focused VC LoftyInc Capital, says investors remain optimistic about the company because they know Andela&#8217;s impact will be greatly felt in the coming years especially when individuals or developers who have worked at the company fully come into their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining financial returns and human development isn&#8217;t an easy task but they have done it and are just getting started,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even as one of the company&#8217;s first local investors, we didn&#8217;t foresee the scale of Andela&#8217;s impact as it has inspired people to launch their own ventures and attract global investors to back them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of Andela&#8217;s technology is still from Africa, and the company continues to grow in Nigeria, the CEO added. It is less of a shift there and more of a “natural evolution of the company” into more of a marketplace to be able to expand quicker around the world.</p>
<p>The marketplace model is also used in niche regions like Africa, where Andela arguably pioneered tech talent matching. Now, tech talent matching sites &#8212; Gebeya, TalentQL, eWorker, GetDev among others &#8212; deploy similar tactics but with different business models and operations to pair engineering talent with those needing of them within and outside the continent.</p>
<p>Other platforms like Semicolon and Decagon have tweaked Andela&#8217;s previous model to work for themselves and continue to train engineers before releasing them into the market.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Since I can&#8217;t build a wall around our talent, here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m reducing turnover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/since-i-cant-build-a-wall-around-our-talent-heres-how-im-reducing-turnover/embed/#?secret=NnmLvy9eaj" data-secret="NnmLvy9eaj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That said, now that Andela is a unicorn, Johnson sees more competition coming into the tech talent space to enable global hiring, but says the company is out in front, particularly with a 96% success rate in placing engineers where they will be most successful. He doesn’t see Andela competing with Toptal at all, looking at his company as a hiring alternative rather than a gig economy marketplace.</p>
<p>That success rate is a testament to the company’s shift to focusing on its matching technology and forming longer-term relationships with customers and talent, he said. In addition, Andela is able to increase income by 64% on average from an engineer’s previous job.</p>
<p>“It is a meaningful shift, especially when you expand that to thousands of engineers,” Johnson added. “It also changes the economic development in the countries where they live.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to expanding into 80 countries, Andela has thousands of developers using its platform and saw the number of applicants increase five times in the past six months. Johnson confirmed in 2019 that its annual revenue rate was $50 million, and though he did not get specific, he did say it is now “so meaningfully higher than that.”</p>
<p>Next up for the company, it will continue to roll out design as a vertical, which follows its recent launch of data and Salesforce engineering verticals. They are in addition to verticals in Angular, DevOps, Golang, iOS, Java, Python, QA, React Native, React.js and Ruby.</p>
<p>Andela is also supporting the expansion to a full digital product suite and adding a more diverse set of skills to cater to its increasingly enterprise clientele, Johnson said.</p>
<p>“Larger companies need a broader diversity of skills on a consistent basis, and now we are expanding the depth and breadth of our talent offering as enterprises become more comfortable with remote work,” he added.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s investment in Andela is its second lead investment in quick succession in Africa &#8212; it is only coming a month after the $400 million Series C round of fintech platform OPay.</p>
<p>Both unicorns, they join fintech platforms Flutterwave and Wave as the region&#8217;s only billion-dollar companies from this year.</p>
<p>In 2016, Africa minted its first unicorn in e-commerce company Jumia (now a publicly traded company) and waited three years later to get another, Interswitch. The continent has seen four already this year, and now has five in total.</p>
<p>With many first-time investors like SoftBank returning to write back-to-back checks and Andela becoming only the second non-fintech unicorn produced on the continent, it is safe to say that Africa is reaching a tipping point.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Withings is launching the ScanWatch Horizon, a dolled-up version of its ScanWatch inside the body of a diving watch. Horizon comes in a bigger, 43mm case size, but is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-hands-on-ifa-2020-070001875.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">otherwise the same device we already think is the best hybrid on the market</a>. That includes the built-in ECG, blood oxygen sensor and sleep apnea tracking, as well as the usual activity and sleep-monitoring features. You’ll also get the same pair of sub dials, one with a small digital screen for notifications, the other an analog activity counter.</p>
<p>At an event in Paris, we got a chance to see the ScanWatch Horizon and try it on, though it was a non-functional prototype. It&#8217;s certainly as pretty in person as the photos show, and with the steel quick-release band, feels nice considering the price. For the first time, Withings will sell the ScanWatch Horizon at jewelers on top of other retail locations.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2209828,2209829,2209838,2209837,2209836,2209835,2209834,2209833,2209832,2209831,2209830"]</p>
<p>The company told Engadget that the chunkier Horizon model has a more &#8220;masculine&#8221; design for larger wrists, with only a 43mm model available. The original ScanWatch, by contrast, came in sizes ranging from 38mm to 42mm.</p>
<p>Sadly, the beefier body and higher price hasn’t added anything to the feature list, and so there’s no GPS on this watch unless your phone comes along for the ride. And, if we’re nit-picking, we can say that while it’s dressed to impress as a diving watch (with an accurate laser-engraved rotating bezel and Luminova watch hands) water resistance is limited to 10ATM. That allows for snorkeling, water activities and some scuba diving, but it isn&#8217;t much compared to most serious diving watches.</p>
<p>That said, the smartwatch world is crying out for anything that matches premium diving watch styling with a hint of smarts. It can’t be that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-tag-heuer-connected-series-3.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">TAG Heuer’s Connected</a> is allowed to become the default in this market by default, especially since it’s running, you know, <em>Wear OS</em>.</p>

<p>Withings told Engadget that FDA approval of its ECG health sensor is holding back the ScanWatch Horizon&#8217;s release in the US, but it&#8217;s hoping to bring it stateside by the end of the year. That&#8217;s also why the original ScanWatch has yet to go on sale in the US, in case you were wondering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for when you can get one of these on your wrist, the ScanWatch Horizon will first launch in the UK from September 29th, priced at £499.95 / €499.95. Buyers will be able to choose the Blue or Green face color, and both models will ship with a quick-release stainless steel and an FKM rubber band (for swimming). It also arrives today in France and Germany, and you can expect it to pop up a bit later elsewhere in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online learning platform Vedantu has raised $100 million in a new financing round and has become the latest Indian startup to become a unicorn following a year of strong growth.</p>
<p>Vedantu, which last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/india-edtech-firms-byjus-and-vedantu-not-holding-acquisition-talks/">refuted rumors of it considering a sale to Byju’s</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $100 million in its Series E financing round that valued it at $1 billion, up from about $275 million early last year.</p>
<p>The round was led by Singapore-headquartered &#8212; and Temasek-backed &#8212; private equity firm ABC World Asia. Existing investors Coatue Management, Tiger Global, GGV Capital, and WestBridge also &#8220;strongly&#8221; participated in the round, the startup said.</p>
<p>Vedantu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/indian-online-tutoring-platform-vedantu-raises-100-million/">offers live and interactive courses for students in grades six through 12</a>. Students who have enrolled for the interactive sessions tap on their smartphone screen or click on the desktop to answer questions.</p>
<p>The startup, which also has partnerships with Airtel and Tata Sky to offer its courses on their respective satellite cable TVs, offers a large library of lessons at no cost to students.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup says it has amassed over 35 million monthly active users, and as of last year, had 200,000 paying customers. That paying subscriber figure should more than double this year, said Vamsi Krishna, co-founder and chief executive of Vedantu, in an interview with TechCrunch. The startup’s revenue has also grown more than 4x in the past one year, and the current annual run rate is around $65 million, he said.</p>
<p>India is home to the largest school-age population in the world (over 250 million individuals). Families across the nation have historically invested heavily in their children’s education to advance in life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the quality of education and its affordability are two major challenges that millions of students, especially those living in smaller cities and towns, have always had to confront. These are also the two major challenges that online education platforms are attempting to address.</p>
<p>Vedantu competes with Unacademy and Byju’s, which is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">country’s most valuable startup</a>. But unlike its rivals, the startup focuses far less on marketing and isn’t raising a new round every few months. Some industry executives have said that Vedantu isn’t as aggressive as its rivals &#8212; though many have <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/inside-india-edtech-byjus/">meant it as a compliment</a>.</p>
<p>Krishna said Vedantu has not raised so much money because it doesn’t need it. He said the startup still has to spend about half of the $100 million that it raised in its previous financing round last year. He said with the new funds Vedantu will attempt to become profitable in the next two years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209817" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209817" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2209817 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="781" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=768,586 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1172 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vedantu-founders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209817" class="wp-caption-text">Vedantu co-founders. (Vedantu)</p></div></p>
<p>As for the comparison with other firms, Krishna said, “there is no right or wrong way to operate.”</p>
<p>“You have to look at our genesis. We were already running a successful education venture. The reason why we started Vedantu was to solve the challenges teachers and students were facing. Having spent 16 years now in the education space, we know that creating a significant impact takes time. So our orientation has always been long-term,” he said.</p>
<p>“As long as you are able to innovate for students and deliver value, nothing can prevent you from creating a long-term sustainable company. You can&#8217;t afford to keep getting distracted with what others are doing and how their revenue or valuation is growing. This is what we have been telling our team from the beginning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Vedantu plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its offerings aimed at students in grade one to five. The startup is also exploring international expansion and eyeing some merger and acquisition opportunities, said Krishna. (Vedantu has organically amassed some users in over 47 additional countries. It&#8217;s beginning to evaluate where else it can formally launch its offerings.)</p>
<p>At stake is a booming edtech market in India that analysts at Bernstein estimate to be worth $126 billion by next year, up from $63 billion in 2016. Spends on K12 education market expected at $55 billion by 2022. Post K12 education market at $71 billion. India edtech user base saw a sharp spike due to Covid: total users grew 2x from 45Mn in 2019 to 90Mn in Apr&#8217;20,&#8221; they wrote in a report to clients earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sugandhi Matta, Chief Impact Officer at ABC World Asia, said, “Vedantu embodies our investment themes of providing better access to quality education and using digital technology to improve lives and livelihoods. In India, online education has the potential to extend the scope of ‘right to education’ to students in the underserved community and capture the ‘next half billion’ income group, representing over half of the country’s student population.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With edtech experiencing meteoric growth in India, Vedantu as the pioneer and category creator in LIVE online tutoring is driving the tectonic shift towards online learning. Vedantu&#8217;s innovative platform empowers teachers who have delivered excellent results to offer personalized education to many students at once, creating the potential for impact at scale. We are pleased to partner with Vamsi and the Vedantu team as they continue to scale and shape learning outcomes for students in India.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of &#8220;no signal&#8221; may be behind us with the advent of Lynk&#8217;s satellite network that lets any modern phone exchange data directly with a satellite overhead, no special antenna or chip required. The company just demonstrated a two-way data link this week and announced its first network partners in Africa and the Bahamas — if everything goes well it may not be long before you can get a signal anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Formerly known as Ubiquitilink, Lynk has been working up to this stage for years, with former Nanoracks founder Charles Miller at the helm. They emerged from stealth early in 2019 to explain that they had launched several test satellites to show that their theory that an ordinary phone could connect to a satellite in low Earth orbit. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/ubiquitilink-advance-means-every-phone-is-now-a-satellite-phone/">Early tests demonstrated</a> they could counteract the noise, doppler shift, and other factors that prompted some experts to call the task impossible, and in 2020 they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/">sent the first ordinary SMS</a> directly from a satellite to a normal phone.</p>
<p>That in itself would have been a remarkable and useful capability to provide to governments and network providers. In emergencies, such as after natural disasters or during blackouts, ordinary mobile networks can&#8217;t be relied on to get important messages to affected regions. Lynk showed that a satellite could hit an entire city with an evacuation or shelter in place message, and indeed that may be one way the tech is used in the future.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ubiquitilink advance means every phone is now a satellite phone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/ubiquitilink-advance-means-every-phone-is-now-a-satellite-phone/embed/#?secret=ahWiCzA26I" data-secret="ahWiCzA26I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until last week that the company demonstrated a two-way connection between a phone and a satellite (their fifth, &#8220;Shannon&#8221;), allowing someone on the surface with no special equipment to, if there&#8217;s a Lynk satellite overhead, both receive and send data. Not a lot of data, of course — but more than enough for an SMS, a GPS location, a weather report, or the like. (Higher datarates will come later as more of the constellation goes up.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We have repeatedly demonstrated the two-way call flow required for a phone to connect to our cell tower in space,&#8221; said Miller in a press release. &#8220;This two-way call flow involves multiple instances of uplink and downlink signaling, including a device request for channel access, and then the corresponding authentication and location update procedures. To date, we&#8217;ve done this with hundreds of phones, and counting, in the UK, the Bahamas, and the US. This has never been proven before with a satellite cell tower and Lynk has done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>To say it&#8217;s a game changer is something of an understatement. Once Lynk puts a few more satellites in orbit, it could cover a good deal of the planet in signal — a narrow and intermittent signal, to be sure, but that&#8217;s way better than nothing if you break your ankle while hiking in the backcountry or want to assure your family you&#8217;re okay after a hurricane knocks out power in your city.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2209741" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209741" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="251" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lynk-logo.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lynk</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to send a text message, anytime and anywhere is the foundation of all safety. If you can send a message to a friend, family member, or neighbor, that can be life saving,&#8221; Miller told me. &#8220;You might not even want it, but your wife or husband wants it so they don&#8217;t have to worry. People are buying peace of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first priority, he said, is to make emergency services available to as many people as possible. A 911 call may not be possible yet, but an SOS message containing basic information and coordinates certainly would be, and this service is something that he wants to make sure is offered at zero or minimal cost, though it&#8217;s not entirely up to them. But anything associated with an official emergency service would be free.</p>
<p>Ordinary messaging would work just like you have signal: either you can send live when the satellite is overhead, or you can put it in the outbox or send queue to be sent out when the space-based network bar appears.</p>
<p>The company plans to offer a free demonstration app that can deliver a weather report for your location anywhere in the world, no matter what, and Miller said they&#8217;d be happy to work with phone or app makers to integrate it with their OS or service.</p>
<p>Amazingly, access will require almost nothing whatsoever from the consumer. When the satellite is available, it will contact your phone just like any other carrier&#8217;s cell towers, since it really is one of those that just happens to be in orbit. Your phone is always aware of the various networks around it other than the one you&#8217;re using — there&#8217;s a constant interplay in the background as different towers are queried and your signal handed off to one or another, or re-registering on the network for whatever reason. You will have to authorize it one way or another, but there will be an app to help with that, as well as agreements among the networks.</p>
<p>As to that, the company is partnering first with Aliv in the Bahamas and Telecel Centrafrique in the Central African Republic. Miller said they are in talks with networks in dozens of countries, including the US, but these small scale deployments are a first step — and the people there really need it. Rural central Africa and remote islands in the Bahamas may not have much in common, but one thing they do is large areas with spotty signal.</p>
<p>Whatever the carrier decides to charge, Lynk gets a share of that, and Miller said they&#8217;re leaving that up to networks to decide: &#8220;People will pay a reasonable price per message. If you can charge 5, 10, 20 cents per message at the beginning, we&#8217;ll let our partners decide, people will pay for it.&#8221; Over time, as the service is more widespread and cheaper for Lynk to provide, the price will (presumably) drop.</p>
<p>Naturally the idea of constant connectivity may clash with the idea many have of privacy. But Miller emphasized that they have no interest in customer data. &#8220;You&#8217;re our customer, not our product. We&#8217;re not interested — it would be very dangerous,&#8221; he said. With the significant exception of 911 calls or SOS messages being a tacit request to provide one&#8217;s location, he said they&#8217;re deliberately building to avoid this kind of conflict.</p>
<p>The company is in talks with dozens of network operators around the world, but regulatory and market questions remain in many places, such as the U.S., where the FCC will need to weigh in. But Miller feels certain they&#8217;re on their way to becoming a major part of the global communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The smartphone in your pocket is like a superpower, it magnifies your abilities as a human being,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But your superpower is broken when you&#8217;re not connected. We solve that problem.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DroneSeed started as a tech-powered alternative to the backbreaking work of large-scale tree-planting, but this important task is only one small part of forest restoration, the infrastructure for which is being pushed to the breaking point by wildfires. Armed with $36M in new funding, the company is reimagining reforestation from root to crown in a modern and vertically integrated way, grafting carbon futures and AI to century-old machinery and logistics.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/26/that-night-a-forest-flew-droneseed-is-planting-trees-from-the-air/">When I first wrote about DroneSeed</a>, the company had just made its debut, showing off its custom-built drones and systems for accelerating reforestation efforts. All the problems and solutions discussed in that article are ongoing — though the company is expanding, it isn&#8217;t by any means changing its core product, which is (as you might guess from the name) using drones to deliver seeds to forests damaged by wildfires.</p>
<h2>Seeds, meet drones</h2>

<p>Briefly stated, DroneSeed replaces human tree planters, who do an invaluable job and do it well, but are increasingly scarce due to the difficulty and low pay of the work, and meanwhile the scale of devastation from fires long ago passed beyond the capabilities of manual labor. Instead of people, the company employs automated drones equipped with specially engineered seed packets and dispensers; they fly low over the landscape, identifying the best places for seed packets — not too rocky, a shallow slope, and many such variables — and fires them off. Drones can deliver dozens of seed packets or, with a more offensive loadout, spray invasive plants that inevitably appear in the wake of fires before trees can take root.</p>
<p>This approach has countless advantages: it replaces undesirable and dangerous jobs of both planters and brush pilots, whose low-altitude helicopter work is unbelievably perilous; the engineered seed packets resist predators like enterprising squirrels; a truck with a fleet of drones can mobilize faster (in a month versus as much as years) and cover far more ground (about 6x) than human operations; the data-heavy process is easily audited and tracked.</p>

<p>Back then the team was still working on early pilot projects, but now the model has been proven in some large scale deployments. Not only that, but the methods have been supercharged by improvements on the tech, research, and regulatory sides. Improved data handling, a larger magazine for seed &#8220;pucks,&#8221; and FAA approvals for drone swarms and flying beyond line of sight mean the same number of drones can do far more work, faster and better than when they first took to the sky.</p>
<p>But what co-founders Grant Canary and Ben Reilly and their growing crew — now over 60 people, up from a dozen or so when I last talked with them — have found is that no matter how effective they make drone-based planting, it&#8217;s only one step in a multi-year process that involves numerous industries, all of which have been stretched to the limit by the continually growing and intensifying wildfires.</p>
<p>The square mileage burnt by fires has doubled in the last 20 years, and the fires themselves are stronger, well beyond the healthy, naturally occurring fires of the past that clear out brush and dead wood, and activate a forest&#8217;s naturally occurring recovery mechanisms. The ones raging today cover far more ground and leave nothing behind but ash and charcoal. &#8220;At some point you run out of nature,&#8221; said DroneSeed&#8217;s Matthew Aghai, who&#8217;s heading up the growing side of things.</p>
<p>Where the heroic work of firefighters ends, the years-long follow-ups by forestry authorities and the private planting industry begins, but now their efforts are being held back by an unexpected obstacle: a tree shortage.</p>

<p>Seed banks and nurseries, both publicly and privately held, have been unable to keep up with demand for years now. Due to market prices (and perhaps manipulation and neglect) beyond the scope of this article, we simply don&#8217;t have the millions of seedlings necessary to replant the innumerable acres being scoured on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>Having studied the public-private relationships and markets, DroneSeed determined that it&#8217;s true after all: if you want a job done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. So they bought Silvaseed, a seed and tree supplier that&#8217;s been in business in the pacific northwest for around 150 years.</p>
<p>Silvaseed has been successful all that time, supplying customers all over the world going back a century, but has remained a modest operation due to the limited capital in the sector. After all, until quite recently there hasn&#8217;t been a run on seedlings that suggested the companies growing them could profitably double or triple their operations.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s seed sorting facility is filled with state of the art machinery&#8230; from the middle of the 20th century. But DroneSeed&#8217;s team was amazed by it nonetheless: an industrial-scale seed sorting and storage facility just waiting to be disassembled, cleaned and oiled, then put back together with some 21st century improvements. They&#8217;ve committed to keeping on and in fact expanding the Silvaseed team as well, so it&#8217;s not a black Friday for them over there. Anyway, who but the original crew would know the ins and outs of the machinery, and the ancient and comprehensive card catalog tracking decades of purchases?</p>

<p>More importantly, however, this is a step for DroneSeed towards becoming not just a planting provider, but the only one-stop shop for wildfire reforestation efforts in the country — perhaps the world, at the scale they are working towards. Today, if you&#8217;re an owner or administrator of a large forest and a wildfire rages through destroying five thousand acres of it, you&#8217;re looking at months, perhaps a year or two of calls and paperwork with state agencies, insurance companies, seed providers, planters, and half a dozen others. DroneSeed aims to make it a single call, and if all goes well there will be seeds (ensconced in nutrient-filled, squirrel-resistant pucks) on the ground within a handful of months.</p>
<p>&#8220;A recent study came out stating that nationally we need to 6x seed collection and 2x nursery space to truly leverage reforestation to mitigate the worst effects of climate change,&#8221; said Canary. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing that work. We&#8217;ve expanded Silvaseed to be the largest private seed bank on the west coast. We also grow millions of seedlings each year and are doubling capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there are no trees if there&#8217;s no money. And the existing pipeline for paying for reforestation is as slow and cumbersome as any decades-old public-private partnership you&#8217;d care to name, except with the added difficulty that the work itself takes place in remote and wild areas only recently ablaze. Think getting your street resurfaced is a pain? Try replanting 10,000 acres of wilderness with methods pioneered a century ago.</p>
<h2>Ex ante carbon</h2>

<p>Landowners whose forests have burned down have, in the past, relied on state funds and insurance money to replant, in the hopes that those forests, once they regrew in 15 or 20 years, would realize their assessed value. Many have opted not to restore the forests at all, instead completing the job the fire started by clearcutting the remainder and converting it to pasture.</p>
<p>In recent years carbon credits have appeared as a new funding source for these projects: seeking to offset emissions but unwilling or unable to change their own processes, companies will pay to have trees planted. The problem is these credits are very, very limited in volume and also take years or decades to mature. Companies compete over buying them, driving the price up per ton of carbon sequestered.</p>
<p>The biggest, richest companies in the world are dying to show how eco-conscious they are, and would spend ten times or more what they do today on carbon reduction projects, if they only had something to spend it on.</p>
<p>The financial innovation that DroneSeed feels confident will support its work — and empty the bursting coffers of industries straining to appear ethical — is carbon futures, or &#8220;ex ante&#8221; credits. Think &#8220;I&#8217;ll gladly grow you a forest tomorrow for funding today,&#8221; but with a lot of independent oversight.</p>
<p>Organizations such as <a href="https://www.climateactionreserve.org/">Climate Action Reserve</a> have pioneered and promulgated a standard approach. An ex ante credit pays for efforts to begin reforestation <em>now</em>, with no need to wait for growth or confirmation. The trees are planted, and the land then put under a long-term easement to legally ensure it isn&#8217;t just going to be logged. An independent forestry team inspects the land after a year or two, confirming the number and health of the planted trees. And DroneSeed improves this process by a number of means, primarily collecting and tracking an enormous amount of data literally from the moment they pick up a seed — its location, type, elevation and other attributes are noted — to when and where it&#8217;s planted, down to the minute and meter, and later, that data can be used to more easily gauge growth and planting success.</p>
<p>I had trouble at first understanding the money movement here — financial instruments aren&#8217;t my strong point, least of all one so abstract. But there really are billions of dollars waiting to be spent on reforestation that are being held back because there&#8217;s no structured way to do so. Sure, Apple could give $50M to a nursery or forestry concern, but it would just be plain old philanthropy, and there&#8217;s little oversight to make sure that $50M goes to good use. When someone comes to them and says, what exactly did that money accomplish, they can only pass the buck.</p>
<p>While for compliance and regulatory purposes official carbon credits are still the only option, ex ante credits aim to be sort of like a LEED or UL standard: though privately defined and verified, still crucial and even necessary part of the industries they enable. Projects certified with, for instance, CAR&#8217;s Climate Forward plan, meet guarantees of growth and oversight, so that when that $50M gets spent, it&#8217;s as sure gone towards that amount of carbon reduction as that a LEED-certified building has certain levels of energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In this way companies can get something a little more tangible out of their greenwashing budget. Being able to say, and prove, that your company covered the reforestation of however many thousands of acres, and in the process removed the equivalent of however many millions of tons of carbon, is a valuable proposition. And the people doing the actual seed collection, sorting, growing, planting, checking, and everything else desperately need the means to do so at greater scale or the rate of destruction will overtake the rate of restoration — a tipping point no one would like to encounter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile landowners can take land destroyed by fires and turn it from liability to asset by, essentially, letting an ex ante credit buyer help finance the restoration and agreeing to leave the resulting trees in place for 20, 50, or 100 years. Between that, the insurance, and grants, they should come out ahead instead of having to give up the land for lost.</p>
<p>The $36M A round making all this possible for DroneSeed was led by Social Capital and Seven Seven Six, with participation from Gaingels with Flight.vc, HBS Lady Angels, Julia Lipton’s Awesome People Ventures, and the Coalition angels including Ashley Mayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trees aren&#8217;t a silver bullet for climate change, but we can buy time,&#8221; said Aghai, a veteran of the forestry services. But like efforts in solar, vehicle electrification, and other climate-focused actions, reforestation requires an immense up front investment to make up for lost time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.totango.com/">Totango</a>, a company that helps SaaS companies track customer engagement to find and fix user flow errors and friction, announced Wednesday that it has raised $100 million in Series D funding, led by Great Hill Partners.</p>
<p>Existing investors BGV, Pitango and Canvas also participated in the round, which gives the company $132 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2010. The company’s last funding round was an <a href="https://www.totango.com/press-releases/customer-success-platform-totango-raises-8m">$8 million Series C round</a> back in 2016. It has previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/05/totango-picks-up-15-5m-more-to-grow-its-product-focused-on-preserving-saas-customer-value/">raised $15.5 million in Series B</a> funding in 2014 and in 2011, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/28/totango-launches-public-beta-raises-3-8-million-to-help-saas-companies-drive-sales/">$3.8 million in Series A</a> funding.</p>
<p>The San Mateo, California-based company’s no-code technology enables customers to quickly and continuously design, optimize and run their entire customer journey, including proactively detecting and resolving churn risks. It has proven out a return on investment for customers of over 23 points in churn reduction and 136% year-over-year expansion growth in revenue.</p>

<p>The past year has been a “super busy” one for Totango, Guy Nirpaz, co-founder and CEO of Totango, told TechCrunch. He says the company’s mission is to democratize customer success and simplify the process so that customers are getting value no matter what the product.</p>
<p>During that time, the company launched a free version of its customer success software, which resulted in thousands of companies being onboarded and seeing an increased growth of over 3x in annual recurring revenue, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of platform signups in the last six quarters grew month over month, something that Nirpaz said demonstrates a “huge market demand.” As such, the new funding will be invested largely into product, design and engineering to keep up with the rapid adoption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even prior to the pandemic, which drove many brands to focus more on customers, Nirpaz was seeing what he called “the revenue experience gap,” which is driving revenue targets on one side and a constant increase in customer expectations on the other.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen momentum like that before, felt that was what was missing and set out to make it simple to embark on that,” he said.</p>
<p>Chris Gaffney, co-founder and managing director of Great Hill Partners said his company started out as customers of Totango. It was clear in the pandemic that organizing customer success was an essential to moving forward, he added. As Great Hill looked for solutions for its own business, Totango’s ease of implementation stood out.</p>
<p>The firm’s investment strategy is built on an initiative of choosing a subsegment, like customer success, and evaluating businesses in that market.</p>
<p>“Totango jumped to the top of the list, based on ease of use,” Gaffney added. “When we evaluated the trends, we saw there would be great growth and adoption. It is clear to us that Totango had an unusual combination of platform technology and product. From the time of productivity to making money, they were the best at that, and that combination made them stand out.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Millennial consumers <a href="https://www.verisk.com/verisk-review/spring-2017/millennials-at-large-potential-disruption-in-the-current-homeowners-insurance-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are emerging as a key demographic in the insurance market</a>, and today a Swedish startup that&#8217;s building a business catering specifically to their needs and priorities is announcing a round of funding to fuel its growth. <a href="https://www.hedvig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedvig</a>, a neo-insurer that provides property, travel, contents, and accident insurance geared to the lifestyles of younger adults &#8212; it also has a &#8220;clumsiness&#8221; policy, and a portion of profits is donated to charity &#8212; has raised $45 million in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Anthemis &#8212; a firm that specializes in fintech and insurance investments &#8212; led the round, with previous backers Cherry Ventures, Obvious Ventures and CommerzVentures participating, along with new backers Swedish Novax, Nineyards Equity, Jonas Kamprad and Mathias Kamprad. Valuation is not being disclosed, and this brings the total amount of funding in Hegvig to $68 million.</p>
<p>The company, based out of Stockholm, is also live in Norway and Denmark and it will use part of the funding to launch in its fourth (yet to be announced) country, outside of Scandinavia. Funds will also be used to continue expanding Hedvig&#8217;s team and product.</p>
<p>The startup today has some 70,000 customers, with the majority of them under the age of 30, so the plan will be to continue building more products for them. In <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/hedvig-ab/pressreleases/hedvig-becomes-first-european-neoinsurer-to-transition-from-mga-to-a-full-stack-carrier-3081740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March of this year</a>, Hedvig picked up an EU-wide insurance carrier license to gear up for that geographical and product growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One of the reasons we transitioned into a full-stack carrier was to enable us to serve our members as they progress through life,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Lucas Carlsen. &#8220;This means we will definitely expand our offering in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To give some context on its growth so far, when we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/swedens-hedvig-raises-10-4m-led-by-obvious-ventures-to-build-nice-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedvig&#8217;s August 2019 raise led by Obvious Ventures</a>, it had 15,000 customers, meaning the startup&#8217;s customer base has grown nearly 370% over the last two years. And Hedvig, like its target demographic, seems to thrive on virality: some 40% of its month-on-month growth comes from word of mouth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carlsen and his two co-founders Fredrik Fors and John Ardelius are all younger consumers themselves and built the platform initially around the concept of &#8220;nice&#8221; insurance, products that are easier and cheaper to buy, faster to use, and generally more attuned to what millennials want. Its first products were around insurance for rented or owned properties; these days, to speak to the wider remint, the homepage features a young man on a European city street doing an extended wheelie on his bike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Insurance has undergone a big shift in recent years thanks to technology, the evolution of smartphone use, and changing consumer expectations. Taking a page from the world of fintech and using networks of APIs to provide a compelling mix of services to be able to focus more squarely on customer relationship and better user experience, there are now a number of insurance service providers in other markets like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshmallow</a> in the U.K. or <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/fr/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemonade</a> out of the U.S. building mobile-first, easier to use experiences for their customers, or those like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a> using technology to upend how insurance is presented to would-be buyers. But Carlsen contends that there is no one in Europe addressing the needs of, well, that free-wheeling cyclist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">&#8220;Hedvig</span> is a premium proposition for a very demanding group of consumers, who expect stellar service and ultra-fast claims handling,&#8221; Carlsen said. &#8220;We cover not only your home, but also your lifestyle through our &#8216;clumsiness insurance&#8217; that covers all of your stuff with one policy, and reimburses you even for damages caused by your own sheer clumsiness &#8212; a type of lifestyle insurance that does not exist in large parts of Europe today.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many might assume that younger adults would be the last people to think of, let alone buy, insurance. They often have less money for discretionary purchases, they may not own properties, and the assumption is that younger people simply feel more invincible. In fact, it seems that the opposite may be the case if you pitch the product more specifically to those younger users&#8217; lifestyles and their values as consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;[Our] insurance experience made us a cult brand in just a few years,&#8221; Carlsen said, adding that about 40% of our growth is organic or through word-of-mouth. &#8220;We now look forward to taking our proposition to markets where insurance is an even more painful experience than in the Nordics.&#8221; In addition to its customer service and insurance offerings, Hedvig also has worked in a social good angle. Its business model is based on taking a 25% cut of the premium a customer pays. Hedvig said that the rest goes into &#8220;a common claims pool for whenever a <span class="il">Hedvig</span> member needs help.&#8221; Whatever is left over from that and the end of the year &#8212; <em>if</em> there’s anything left in the common claims pool) at the end of the year &#8212; is then donated to charity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, it sounds like it&#8217;s likely that Hedvig will look to expand to other demographics. &#8220;<span id="m_-2950506719947182324gmail-docs-internal-guid-cdb3a853-7fff-5205-d622-4aafb9e670db">It’s not surprising that it’s the on-demand younger generation that appreciates our dedication to service and ultra-fast claims handling,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;With that said, we can clearly see how others want to join in with house insurance being our fastest growing segment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ruth Foxe Blader, a partner at Anthemis, and Matthew Jones, an MD at the firm, co-led this investment. It&#8217;s notable that Blader, when at AllianzX, also led an investment in Lemonade. Jones, meanwhile, is taking a board seat with this round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The <span class="il">Hedvig</span> team has a truly unique mix of talent and skills in technology, design and insurance. The combination of their creativity and customer empathy gives them an advantage that will be difficult for others to follow. Insurance is exciting again!” he said in a statement.</p>

<p><a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/">Night School Studio</a>, the independent game developer known for narrative-driven titles like “Oxenfree,” announced today it has been acquired by Netflix. This makes it the first games studio the streaming giant has purchased.</p>
<p>In Netflix’s announcement, Mike Verdu, vice president of game development, wrote Night School’s “commitment to artistic excellence and proven track record make them invaluable partners as we build out the creative capabilities and library of Netflix games together.” He added that Netflix plans to add “exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play” that will be included with its membership, and have no ads or in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Night School Studio was founded in 2014 by Sean Krankel, a former senior game designer at Disney Interactive, and Adam Hines, who was a lead writer at Telltale Games. (Telltale Games was a Netflix partner,<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/telltale-games-shut-down-official-netflix"> working on interactive shows</a> like “Minecraft: Storymode” adventure before shutting down).</p>
<p>In a statement on Night School’s site, Krankel wrote “Netflix gives film, TV and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing.”</p>
<p>For fans of Oxenfree and other Night School titles, Krankel reassured them that it will keep working on Oxenfree II and “cooking up new game worlds.”</p>
<p>“The Netflix team has shown the utmost care for protecting our studio culture and creative vision,” he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>News of the acquisition comes less than a day after Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">launched three new casual mobile games in Poland, Italy and Spain</a>, a month after it released two games that were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">tie-ins to the “Stranger Things” series</a>.</p>
<p>In Netflix’s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">second-quarter shareholder letter</a>, the company said it is in the early stages of exploring its gaming model, and views gaming as another content category, like its original films, animation and reality TV shows.</p>
<p>Before working on mobile games, Netflix first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/netflix-debuts-choose-your-own-adventure-stories-for-kids/">ventured into interactive storytelling</a> four years ago, when it launched “choose-your-own-adventure”-style children’s shows. The next year, it took the format to content for adult viewers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/black-mirror-bandersnatch-trailer/">Black Mirror’s “Bandersnatch” episode</a>. Since then, it’s added other interactive children’s shows like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/netflix-is-adding-an-interactive-minecraft-story-to-its-lineup-denies-entry-into-gaming/">“Minecraft: Story Mode,”</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/netflixs-emilys-wonder-lab-is-smart-interactive-science-tv-for-kids/">“Emily’s Wonder Lab.”</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Relan is not exactly a household name, but he has seen a lot over the course of his career and enjoyed a fair amount of success. A Stanford grad who logged time at Hewlett-Packard and Oracle before becoming the CTO of the ill-fated, bubble-era company Webvan, Relan has, in more recent years, become known in founder circles for creating three &#8220;low-volume, high-touch incubators&#8221; that have punched above their weight.</p>
<p>The very first class back in 2007 included founder Jason Citron who, at the time, was developing a social mobile gaming company, OpenFeint, that he subsequently sold in 2011 to the social gaming platform Gree of Japan for $104 million.</p>
<p>Relan, who played operating partner, owned half the company, and when Citron <a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/openfeint-ceo-jason-citron-resigns/">almost immediately</a> decided to start a second company that he would later call Discord, he headed straight back to Relan to help build it. (Relan&#8217;s other &#8220;graduates&#8221; include the social gaming company Crowdstar, which <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/64788/is-glu-mobiles-45-million-crowdstar-acquisition-already-paying-off/">sold</a> to Glu Mobile in 2016, and Agawi, an early game streaming company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/report-last-year-google-secretly-acquired-agawi-a-specialist-in-streaming-native-mobile-apps/">sold to Google</a> in 2015.)</p>
<p>Relan long ago moved on from gaming and is now focused on climate change, equality and the &#8220;ethics of technology,&#8221; but he talked with us recently about his relationship with Citron. (Relan sat on Discord&#8217;s board until last year.) He also said he has &#8220;two big things brewing &#8212; one in AI and one in climate change,&#8221; so watch this space for more information. In the meantime, you can hear our conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vc-peter-relan-on-writing-discords-first-check/id1498270180?i=1000535831815">here</a> or read lightly edited excerpts from it below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You launched your accelerator, YouWeb, around the same time as Y Combinator got underway, but it was structured very differently.</strong></p>
<p>PR: Every year, we were like, let&#8217;s just [partner with a] few entrepreneurs here, and we&#8217;ll give them a year instead of the traditional three months, and we&#8217;ll co-create. So we don&#8217;t have hundreds of companies. Over 15 years, we&#8217;ve incubated about 30 companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did founders find you?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PR: It&#8217;s all referenced by other people. So, for example, I met Jason when he was 22. He was a roommate of my nephew, who had graduated from Berkeley. I was a Stanford alumnus; I asked a couple of people at Stanford, and we found the founders from there. It was very much low key. We weren&#8217;t trying to build this massive application process. We were just looking for founders who have particular types of inclinations; because I&#8217;m an engineer, I really wanted very techie, developer founders.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When you say &#8216;we,&#8217; who else was involved, and were you funding this incubator out of your own pocket or did you have outside investors?</strong></p>
<p>PR: I started with my own funds, but then we rounded up a network for the founders, including seven or eight investors who were executives and other founders who succeeded [including at] Yahoo, Google, Oracle and Microsoft. It was like $2.5 million for that first class, and we sponsored eight founders.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One was Jason, whose first company &#8212; co-founded with an EIR at YouWeb, Danielle Cassley &#8212; was OpenFeint. How fully baked was that company at the outset?</strong></p>
<p>PR: Jason is a core gamer at heart, and he arrived saying, &#8216;I just want something in gaming.&#8217; There was no idea, there was no particular game, there was no particular product, and actually OpenFeint, which is a social chat platform, began as a game called &#8220;Aurora Feint&#8221; that was a really beautiful game and was really well-received, but in terms of financial success, it was doing okay. And the most interesting thing about it, inside, was actually a social platform that had leaderboards and achievements and chat. So we pulled out the social platform and said, &#8216;Let&#8217;s [put] the game aside and let&#8217;s scale this platform.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was your role?</strong></p>
<p>PR: I was executive chairman. He was co-founder and CEO. So we worked like business partners. He was the product guy. I was the mentor. And Danielle was involved, but she moved on. So it was Jason and me pretty much. I would help with the financings and with the strategy and business development. We did a big deal with AT&amp;T to pre-install OpenFeint on AT&amp;T mobile phones. So there was a lot of that kind of stuff. My goal was to be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Y Combinator famously takes a 7% stake for its early checks. What percentage of OpenFeint did you own?</strong></p>
<p>PR: We used to do co-creation, so we would be 50/50. Obviously, it was a big hit for YouWeb [when it sold], because we were equal partners with Jason and Danielle. In our second [batch] where we worked with Discord, we [operated] much more like YC because I wanted to actually do a little less work and work across a broader number of fields, not just gaming.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It says something about your relationship that Jason turned around and came back to you with Discord. It&#8217;s also interesting that a 26-year-old who&#8217;d just made a fortune would jump right back into work.</strong></p>
<p>PR: I remember when he left Gree. It was late October or November of 2011, and he just sent a simple email saying &#8216;I&#8217;m back.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Great.&#8217;</p>
<p>Again, it started with a game and &#8212; we&#8217;re skipping ahead here &#8212; three years later, the game is doing okay but not great, and the chat platform features are very, very popular and, like déjà vu, he suddenly pulls out the chat platform and launches it as Discord. So [it&#8217;s] repeat [and] play but done much better this time, obviously, right? [Discord] has now got more than 300 million, 400 million users now &#8212; well over 300 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And now its valuation is reportedly valued at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding?sref=gni836kR">$15 billion</a>. How did its Series A round come together? I&#8217;d heard at some point that some firms &#8212; maybe General Catalyst, maybe Accel &#8212; lost out on that opportunity. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p>PR: Actually, the first round of Discord was really interesting. It wasn&#8217;t even a priced round. It was really people investing in Jason, and perhaps a little bit in the fact that we were working together &#8212; sort of like, &#8216;Hey, here&#8217;s a couple of people who&#8217;ve been successful with something, and here&#8217;s a guy who wants to keep going and do something bigger now maybe.&#8217; So the first round was really a bunch of VCs who had essentially decided to write these $250,000 checks. Accel was in there and General Catalyst and IDG and Time Warner.</p>
<p>And then the question you&#8217;re asking is how Benchmark, a completely different firm that was not [part of] those first 10 checks and was not a seed investor, ended up getting the deal. What happened was TechCrunch Disrupt. He got to the finalist thing and people really loved his presentation style and his company and [longtime Benchmark investor] Mitch Lasky noticed it and said, &#8216;Hey, we should talk.&#8217; I think it was almost so fast that if I recall, it was really just, &#8216;Hey, is anybody else really ready to do something? If not, I have a term sheet.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote work may have changed the way we spend our days, but there’s quite a sneaky disruptor among us: burnout. As the pandemic drags on, employees are either soul-searching for a bigger purpose or simply exhausted by the uncertainty and stale culture of their current jobs.</p>
<p>It’s not a small subset of the working population, either: Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work">estimates</a> that 41% of people are likely to consider leaving their employer within the next year, and 46% are planning to make a major pivot or career transition.</p>

<p>Employers are under fresh pressure to retain talent, which has made some turn to more comprehensive and creative benefits, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">pre-conception and postpartum support</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/headspace-ginger-lyra-health-calm/">text-based mental health care and on-demand meditation</a>. As the movement to support employees better gathers momentum, traditionally consumer-focused edtech startups are taking notice.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, direct-to-consumer companies, including Outschool and MasterClass, have quietly spun up products targeting employers. The platforms, which mix entertainment and education, have an unconventional value proposition. Outschool, an after-school enrichment platform for kids, is betting that working parents could use some extra help keeping their children engaged. And MasterClass, which offers expert-led classes on-demand, hopes that a chat with their favorite celebrity could inspire a star employee to stay at the company longer.</p>
<p>The belief that employers will invest in edutainment benefit platforms is a departure from the traditional pitch that edtech has used to break into this market. Companies like Udemy and Guild Education, for example, focus much more on reskilling and upskilling workforces to fill the latest in-demand roles.</p>
<p>As nascent efforts begin to get real investment, consumer edtech’s success will hinge on whether it can effectively, and consistently, translate its impact to employers in the long term. Put simply, entrepreneurs need to convince employers to turn to edtech for a solution even more elusive than education: motivation.</p>
<h2>When the struggle is more obvious</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyyamnerjenkins/">Amy Yamner Jenkins</a> joined Outschool last fall as a contractor to grow the after-school marketplace’s business. When schools didn’t reopen in August 2021, she said schools and employers began turning to Outschool to relieve the stress of another year of remote learning.</p>
<p>These early customer signals fundamentally changed Outschool’s priorities. A year later, Jenkins is the head of schools and distribution, in charge of a 10-person team that solely works on helping get Outschool into more schools and employer benefits packages. Today, over 100 companies, including Alto Pharmacy, Mursion and Twitter, use Outschool.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was easy to be a working parent prior to the pandemic,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;But it just feels like the pandemic made it even more obvious [to companies] what the struggle was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before a startup lands its first customer or investor, its founders must invest time and energy to develop intellectual property.</p>
<p>In some cases, IP can be as tangible as a patent, but strategic assets can also take the form of product visualizations, target audience data or early product/engineering prototypes.</p>
<p>Brett Lovelady, founder of design firm Astro Studios, defines these design and development assets as &#8220;creative capital,&#8221; which &#8220;can ultimately last longer and potentially become more valuable&#8221; than venture capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/creative-capital-is-the-secret-sauce-not-venture-capital/">In a guest post</a> for TechCrunch+, he describes different types of creative capital and includes multiple examples of how startups can leverage it for success.</p>

<p>It’s a two public-offering week, with both U.S. software company Amplitude and direct-to-consumer eyeglass purveyor Warby Parker set to go public via direct listings.</p>
<p>“Even if you are tired of IPOs, these two warrant your attention,” writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two direct listings will help us figure out which side of the public-private divide is truly undervaluing startups,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s either pesky bankers extracting unearned value from hardworking Silicon Valley types at graduation day, or it’s private-market investors irked that anyone else accretes upside from startups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madison Schill, director of marketing and communications at Livescale, breaks down essential strategies for companies that hope to build their brands via online shopping, livestreaming and social media.</p>
<p>The first step? Start developing relationships now with influencers so your live-shopping experience has an authentic feel.</p>
<p>“Ahead of a volatile retail season, one theme is clear: It’s a now-or-never moment for brands to adopt live shopping, expand their audience ownership and build a new community of influencers,” Schill writes in a guest post that includes case studies from brands like Knix, Urban Decay and Lancôme.</p>

<p>To repair the damage humankind has inflicted on Earth&#8217;s climate patterns, solutions that touch nearly every aspect of our behavior are required.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have 100 areas, 1,000 different areas that need to be reinvented and industries that need to be reconstructed,&#8221; SOSV managing general partner Sean O’Sullivan said last week at TechCrunch Disrupt in conversation with reporter Kirsten Korosec and Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there’s going to be some percentage of folks who are going to stiff-arm the whole thing,&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;But by and large, I think the majority of people are starting to cooperate a lot more.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/heres-everything-amazon-announced-this-morning-recap/"><strong>Amazon releases a metric fuckload of hardware:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">Including a robot, it turned out</a>. The company also dropped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-introduces-amazon-glow-an-interactive-video-calling-device-for-kids-and-families/">video calling device</a> along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-takes-on-fitbit-with-the-80-halo-view/">with a fitness wearable</a>. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">company’s $999 Astro robot</a> is driving the most attention today, but the company’s list of new hardware was extensive. On the heels of the Microsoft Surface event, it’s important to remember that every major software company also has a hardware effort.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/"><strong>The Rivian EV truck is good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch’s inimitable transportation guru <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten Korosec</a> has notes on the 2022 Rivian R1T electric truck on the blog today, and she’s largely impressed. What did she like? Terrain flexibility, acceleration speed and internal details. Not to mention that the R1T is “no delicate flower” despite its premium finishes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/"><strong>The huge opportunity in climate tech:</strong></a> Korosec dropped another major piece recently, this one focused on the “enormous challenges and abundant opportunities” for startups amid the rising climate crisis. Startups have shown a strong ability to drive software revenues. Perhaps upstart tech companies will also play a role in keeping our planet &#8212; our home! &#8212; cool in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get too deep into the day’s venture capital roundup, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/five-questions-for-venture-capital-in-q3/">took a look ahead to the third quarter’s venture capital results</a>, detailing the five questions we are most curious about. Those include what’s up with venture investment in China, what Latin American tallies will tell us about the spread of startup activity in the region and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya/">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> dug <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/do-you-need-another-app-to-discover-beautiful-places-when-you-travel/">into Backdrop</a></strong>, a startup that has built a “photo-sharing app that merges tech, social media and travel,” asking if we really need another mobile application to help us find gorgeous places while we travel. Perhaps Instagram has real competition on the horizon?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/highnote-emerges-from-stealth-with-54m-and-a-plan-to-take-on-marqeta-in-the-world-of-card-issuing-as-a-service/"><strong>Highnote wants to take on Marqeta:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The world of card issuance is a busy one &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">more here from TechCrunch+</a> &#8212; and is about to get busier. Flush with $54 million in capital, Highnote just dropped its stealth tag and showed the world what it is building, namely what we described as a way to make it “easy for any company of any size to provide virtual payment cards to their customers.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/stark-a-hub-for-accessible-software-design-launches-a-mac-app-in-beta/"><strong>Stark wants to make software more accessible:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/microsoft-offers-new-accessibility-testing-service-for-pc-and-xbox-games/">not just Microsoft</a> that is busy making technology products more accessible. Stark is building tech to help lots of companies get in on the work. The company’s product is now in private beta, allowing users to upload designs, which Stark will then parse to identify possible accessibility issues along with suggesting possible changes. Cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/hospitals-clinics-patient-platform-heydoc-raises-8-3m-series-a-led-by-smedvig-capital/"><strong>Heydoc raises $8.3M for medical data management:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Heydoc’s work to build a “system for managing the medical data and admin tasks” that healthcare workers run into all the time is now flush and has designs to break out of its current market in the U.K. to other locales.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/federated-genomic-data-startup-lifebit-raises-60m-round-led-by-tiger-global/"><strong>Today’s Tiger round is Lifebit:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Another day, another huge check from Tiger. This time it’s Lifebit, which works to provide access to biomedical data that could help in drug discovery. This reminds me a bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">what Cellino is up</a> to, albeit from a different angle. See, not <em>all</em> startups have to build enterprise-focused software. How nice to be reminded of that!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rize-raises-11-4m-to-scale-its-embedded-fintech-service/">Rize raises $11.4M for embedded fintech, with a twist:</a> </strong>Embedded banking solutions are pretty common these days. What sets Rize apart, in its view, is a method of uniting different account types under a single user profile. Synthetic accounts, in its own verbiage.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong> </strong>Which form of venture debt should your startup go for?</h2>
<p>Startup founders have more options than in years past when it comes to fundraising, thanks in large part to a surplus of liquidity. Besides traditional VC, crowdfunding, venture banks and venture debt funds are all viable options.</p>
<p>In a detailed overview of venture debt options, Andy Weyer, managing director of technology at Runway Growth Capital, shares three use cases depicting how debt capital can benefit borrowers hoping to retain leverage for future rounds or access working capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle,&#8221; advises Weyer.</p>

Vista is buying Blue Prism for just under 1.1 billion pounds, with an intention to unite the company with another of its own portfolio entities. Blue Prism is a public company, mind, so you should have heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/cloudflare-enters-infrastructure-services-market-with-new-r2-storage-product/"><strong>And, finally, Cloudflare takes on AWS:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Cloudflare is best known for its content <em>delivery</em> work, not for providing the sort of cloud infra that Amazon’s AWS is famous for selling. And yet Cloudflare intends to poke the dragon with R2, a forthcoming service from the public company that will take on Amazon’s S3 storage product. Notably, R2 will delete data egress fees, perhaps putting Amazon into something akin to a pricing tight spot.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[We caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum, and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roham Gharegozlou has been betting on the potential success of NFTs for years. This year, it happened.</p>
<p>Gharegozlou and the team at his startup, <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, shipped the blockchain world&#8217;s first popular game, CryptoKitties, back in 2017. The startup then launched NBA Top Shot late last year, and it promptly caught fire and brought worldwide attention to the crypto collectibles space.</p>
<p>We caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it would be fast, but NBA Top Shot went from 4,000 to 400,000 users in a matter of weeks,&#8221; Gharegozlou said.</p>
<p>Top Shot&#8217;s success has made <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a> a venture darling — the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">announced a $250 million funding round last week</a>, reaching a reported $7.6 billion valuation. The massive valuation is not just a bet on the continued success of Top Shot, it&#8217;s also a nod to the potential of the platform that Dapper Labs is building for other consumer-minded blockchain developers. The startup has built its own blockchain, called Flow, sidestepping the popular Ethereum blockchain, which the vast majority of successful NFT platforms live on today. Dapper Labs is betting that won&#8217;t be the case for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first year or year and a half of Dapper Labs, we spent about $30 million trying to build on Ethereum. We built Dapper Wallet — the user experience you see on Top Shot, we tried building it on top of Ethereum,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We realized there are multiple issues. There&#8217;s cost, there&#8217;s scale, there&#8217;s throughput, there&#8217;s all these things, but fundamentally, it&#8217;s all about user experience. The user experience that you build for when you&#8217;re designing a protocol and blockchain for financially sophisticated traders or very hardcore DeFi things, those aren&#8217;t the same trade-offs that you want when you&#8217;re building for consumer applications.&#8221;</p>
