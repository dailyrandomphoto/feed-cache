										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the spring comes color from Apple. The new iMacs are offered in 7 different shades including a nice deep purple. As a refresh to the lineup, Apple has also released an iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in a purple hue as well. I have a preview unit in hand to look at and so look at it I did. The color is great, closer to a violet on the sides and a lilac on the back.</p>
<p>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>great</em></span> color. In my opinion probably the best color of iPhone 12 released so far. Apple releasing this new purple shade also, to me, says to the people that love the mini: don’t worry this will still be available for a while. But, conversely, it could be a sign that this version of the mini might be the only one we get for a while. Maybe I&#8217;m reading into it too much and this is a &#8216;because we could&#8217; thematic tie-in that offers a new option for spring buyers. Either way, it&#8217;s a really nice looking phone that ties into the &#8216;<a href="https://blog.sampleboard.com/color-trends-2021-millennial-purple-interior-obsession/">millenial purple</a>&#8216; (read: lilac) trend that is booming in design and fashion right now. Apple&#8217;s color theory team is always pretty well on trend, so no change here.</p>
<p>Apple has also released a nice purple silicon case which complements it well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want a deep dive on the seriously capable offering that the iPhone 12 mini is, feel free to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/iphone-12-mini-review-tiny-package-big-bang/">reference our review</a> from late last year.</p>
<p>Here are some nice pictures of the purple iPhone 12 mini for you to look at:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli startup <a href="https://whizzco.com/">WhizzCo</a> says it&#8217;s time for publishers to adopt the programmatic, auction-based approach when it comes to the ads in content recommendation widgets like Outbrain and Taboola.</p>
<p>After all, publishers regular employ this approach for most of their other digital ad units. But co-founder and CEO Alon Rosenthal said that when trying to monetize his own websites, he discovered for himself that it was &#8220;impossible&#8221; to maximize the revenue from those widgets in the same way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our real pain,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So with WhizzCo, Rosenthal and his team have built what they call a Content Recommendation Yield Platform, pulling native advertising from more than 40 different content recommendation providers, predicting which one will deliver the highest revenue for a given impression (whether that&#8217;s measured in CPM, CPC or CPA) and then delivering the ad from that provider.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/embed/#?secret=GyN3uxO11H" data-secret="GyN3uxO11H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rosenthal added that WhizzCo works with publishers to ensure that the recommendation widgets and ads look like they&#8217;re a native part of a page, and that their appearance doesn&#8217;t change regardless of where the ad comes from. He also said the publishers implement WhizzCo&#8217;s JavaScript on &#8220;not in the header, but on the actual code of the site — by doing that, we eliminate any loading problems whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although WhizzCo is coming out of stealth now, it was actually founded in 2017 and has already worked with a number of publishers, including Penske Media Corporation&#8217;s She Media. In a statement, She Media Senior Vice President of Operations Ryan Nathanson said, &#8220;WhizzCo&#8217;s platform allowed us to create a competitive ecosystem, which has enabled tighter customization, competition and editorial guideline control, yielding a 75% increase in content recommendation CPM.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Rosenthal said that on average, WhizzCo customers see a 37.7% lift in content recommendation revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our motto is that no one delivers 100 percent performance, 100 percent of the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No matter who you are, even if you’re Google [or any of the other big ad companies,] you cannot perform best at all times. That’s where we come in with our technology.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital market had a cracking start to the year. Coming off a 2020 high, VC totals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">in the United States</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">in Europe,</a> and among competitive verticals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">like insurtech</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">and AI</a> are on pace to set new records in 2021.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire dealmaking and trend of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">larger venture checks at higher valuations</a> that The Exchange has tracked for some time require private-market investors to make decisions faster than ever. For venture capitalists, the timeline for reaching conviction around a startup’s thesis and executing due diligence has become compressed.</p>
<p>Some venture capitalists are turning to data to move more quickly. Some are spending more time preparing to be vetted themselves. And some investors are simply doing the work beforehand.</p>

<hr />
<p>We were tipped off to the concept of pre-diligence during the reporting process for a look into recent fundraising trends in the AI/ML space. <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire</a> investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das">Jai Das</a>, when asked about how he was handling a competitive and swiftly moving market for AI startup investments, said that &#8220;most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>How does that work in practice? Per Das, startups that raise quick Series A and B rounds are &#8220;tracked by [early-stage] investors as soon as they raise their seed financings. So there is no need to do any due diligence during the financing and hence most of these financings are pre-emptive.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Venture capital: Now more about sales than ever before!</em></p>
<p>This morning, The Exchange is digging into the question of how VCs are handling diligence in a world where the most attractive deals can open and close faster than ever, and old models of deep diligence and paced dealmaking are outmoded.</p>
<h2>Getting to yes</h2>
<p>One way that investors are betting on themselves in a bid to speed their diligence and decision-making is by investing in their own tech. That may sound obvious, given that venture capital dollars often land in the accounts of tech-focused companies, but in a business that was previously known for its relationship focus &#8212; more on that shortly &#8212; the trend is worth considering.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://congruentvc.com/">Congruent Ventures</a>, the early stage investment firm focused on technologies and services designed to avert the current climate emergency, has raised $175 million in financing for its latest fund.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm, which now has $300 million in assets under management, is focused on investing in pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds and was founded by Abe Yokell and Joshua Posamentier, two longtime investors in the climate space with over twenty years of experience investing in the sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the dawn of a new administration dedicated to infrastructure [and] climate and a long-overdue influx of capital towards pressing global issues surrounding climate change, we cover the gamut with a portfolio of over three dozen companies working in transportation, energy transition, food and agriculture to sustainable production and consumption,&#8221; Yokell wrote in an email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the portfolio include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">the mycelium meat producer Meati</a>; Milk Run, a farm to table food marketplace; PicoMES, which develops software for efficient manufacturing; Parallel Systems, a developer of electrified, autonomous rail cars; Alloy Enterprises, which is an additive manufacturer for aluminum; Hippo Harvest, which provides autonomous greenhouse growing systems; and Amp Robotics, a provider of recycling robots to improve efficiencies among hard-pressed waste recycling organizations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm counts some high profile limited partners like Microsoft&#8217;s Climate Innovation Fund, affiliates of Prelude Ventures; the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Turst and Surdna Foundation, along with UC Investments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Until very recently, there was a total dearth of early-stage capital focused on climate and sustainability,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner and co-founder, Congruent Ventures. “We invest at the earliest stages where we can help entrepreneurs avoid a myriad of pitfalls, help them build strong companies, raise additional capital, and as a result, tackle the world’s most pressing environmental problems in some of the world’s largest sectors.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One third of Congruent&#8217;s companies are working directly with energy or civil infrastructure and could<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/"> stand to gain tremendously from any infrastructure spending bill that could come from Washington</a>. Beyond that, the firm&#8217;s limited partners include infrastructure investors with over $700 billion of assets under management that are all potential customers for the technologies developed by the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies, the firm said in a statement.</p>

<p>TechCrunch has had its eye on Albedo since its Y Combinator run, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pregame-y-combinator-with-equity/">discussing</a> the firm&#8217;s approach to providing what it describes as &#8220;aerial-quality&#8221; images &#8212; though they are taken from space instead of a drone or aircraft. In more technical parlance, Albedo wants to provide 10-centimeter visual imagery and 2-meter thermal imagery.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/silicon_chris">Topher Haddad</a>, Albedo&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, the company aims to launch its first satellite in 2024 and bring its full constellation in orbit by 2027. With eight satellites, the company can provide daily image revisits; with 24, it can do that three times each day, though the eight-satellite fleet will be an early milestone for the startup, according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#8217;t someone already tried to build what Albedo is working on? The company, Haddad explained, has been made possible in part due to advances in the larger space economy, and the fact that major cloud providers AWS and Azure have both built out services to handle satellite data &#8212; &#8220;AWS Ground Station&#8221; in the case of the former and &#8220;Azure Orbital&#8221; in the latter. Mix in cheaper launches and <a href="https://aerospace.org/article/building-modular-future-space">more modular satellite construction</a>, and what Albedo wants to do is becoming possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142296" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142296" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2142296 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg 837w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142296" class="wp-caption-text">Albedo CEO and co-founder Topher Haddad, via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some tech risk to what Albedo aims to do, however. Haddad explained to TechCrunch how his company hopes to employ in-orbit refueling for its satellites&#8217; electric propulsion so that they can stay afloat longer; if that effort fails, or drag winds up being worse than anticipated, Albedo&#8217;s satellites might have to opt for slightly higher orbits and lower-res photos in the 12- to 15-centimeter range.</p>
<p>For fun, what does that resolution mean in more practical terms? A 10-centimeter-resolution image from a satellite is one in which each pixel is 10 centimeters on each side. So, a 15-centimeter-resolution image would have pixels that were more than twice the surface area of a 10-centimeter shot.</p>
<p>Resolution matters, as does the regularity of new pictures being taken. On the latter front, the company&#8217;s eventual fleet of satellites should keep its photos fresh.</p>
<p>Albedo intends to target companies of all sizes as customers. The imaging world is a big market, with Haddad expecting to find customers among property insurance companies, mapping concerns, utility firms and other large companies. And now it has more capital than ever to pursue its goals.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>It takes more money to get a space startup off the ground than it takes to iterate on an early software product. So, what does the $10 million it just raised get Albedo? The first thing is staff. When TechCrunch last spoke with Haddad, the company was still a team of three. That&#8217;s about to change, however; a number of new hires recently accepted offers, and the company expects to add another four or five people to its staff in addition to those already planning to join.</p>
<p>Albedo said it anticipates a staff of 10 to 12 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The $10 million will also allow the company to fund a down payment on rocket space and payments to suppliers that should allow Albedo to wrap up its satellite design. Per its CEO, the startup expects to raise a larger Series A in around a year to help finance getting its first satellite into orbit. That moment will allow the startup to better prove its technology, and, if all goes well, help it to raise even more capital to keep its launch schedule packed.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far the company can get with its new capital, and if it finds sufficient, ahem, lift to reach the next funding milestone. If it does, we could wind up covering the launch of its first satellite. That would be fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bosch executives on Thursday criticized proposed EU regulations that would ban the internal combustion engine by 2025, saying that lawmakers “shy away” from discussing the consequences of such a ban on employment.</p>
<p>Although the company reported it is creating jobs through its new businesses, particularly its fuel cell business, and said it was filling more than 90% of these positions internally, it also said an all- or mostly-electric transportation revolution would likely affect jobs. As a case in point, the company told reporters that ten Bosch employees are needed to build a diesel powertrain system, three for a gasoline system — but only one for an electrical powertrain.</p>
<p>Instead, Bosch sees a place for renewable synthetic fuels and hydrogen fuel cells alongside electrification. Renewable synthetic fuels made from hydrogen are a different technology from hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells use hydrogen to generate electricity, while hydrogen-derived fuels can be combusted in a modified internal combustion engine (ICE).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“An opportunity is being missed if renewable synthetic fuel derived from hydrogen and CO2 remains off-limits in road transport,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner said.</p>
<p>“Climate action is not about the end of the internal-combustion engine,” he continued. “It’s about the end of fossil fuels. And while electromobility and green charging power make road transport carbon neutral, so do renewable fuels.”</p>
<p>Electric solutions have limits, Denner said, particularly in powering heavy-duty vehicles. The company earlier this month established a joint venture with Chinese automaker Qingling Motors to build fuel cell powertrains in a test fleet of 70 trucks.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 sustainable industries where founders and VCs can see green by going green&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/4-sustainable-industries-where-founders-and-vcs-can-see-green-by-going-green/embed/#?secret=3KFumc04vr" data-secret="3KFumc04vr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bosch’s confidence in hydrogen fuel cells and synthetic fuels isn’t to the exclusion of battery-electric mobility. The company, which is one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive and industrial components, said its electromobility business is growing by almost 40 percent, and the company projects annual sales of electrical powertrain components to increase to around €5 billion ($6 billion) by 2025, a fivefold increase.</p>
<p>However, the German company said it was “keeping its options open” by also investing €600 million ($721.7 million) in fuel cell powertrains in the next three years.</p>
<p>“Ultimately Europe won’t be able to achieve climate neutrality without a hydrogen economy,” Denner said.</p>
<p>Bosch has not been immune from the effects of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">global semiconductor shortage</a>, which continues to drag into 2021. Board member Stefan Asenkerschbaumer warned that there is a risk the shortage “will stifle the recovery that was forecast” for this year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company executives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/the-station-a-chat-with-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-the-nyc-scooter-winners-and-tusimple-goes-public/">told investors</a> earlier this month that the situation may persist into 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook may be reconfiguring its News Feed algorithms. After being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/technology/facebook-twitter-google-capitol-riots-hearing.html">grilled by lawmakers</a> about the role that Facebook played in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/incorporating-more-feedback-into-news-feed-ranking/">announced</a> this morning it will be rolling out a series of News Feed ranking tests that will ask users to provide feedback about the posts they&#8217;re seeing, which will later be incorporated into Facebook&#8217;s News Feed ranking process. Specifically, Facebook will be looking to learn which content people find inspirational, what content they want to see less of (like politics), and what other topics they&#8217;re generally interested in, among other things.</p>
<p>This will be done through a series of global tests, one of which will involve a survey directly beneath the post itself which asks, &#8220;how much were you inspired by this post?,&#8221; with the goal of helping to show more people posts of an inspirational nature closer at the top of the News Feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142299" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142299" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2142299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another test will work to the Facebook News Feed experience to reflect what people want to see. Today, Facebook prioritizes showing you content from friends, Groups and Pages you&#8217;ve chosen to follow, but it has algorithmically crafted an experience of whose posts to show you and when based on a variety of signals. This includes both implicit and explicit signals &#8212; like how much you engage with that person&#8217;s content (or Page or Group) on a regular basis, as well as whether you&#8217;ve added them as a &#8220;Close Friend&#8221; or &#8220;Favorite&#8221; indicating you want to see more of their content than others, for example.</p>
<p>However, just because you&#8217;re close to someone in real life, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you like what they post to Facebook. This has driven families and friends apart in recent years, as people discovered by way of social media how people they thought they knew really viewed the world. It&#8217;s been a painful reckoning for some. Facebook hasn&#8217;t managed to fix the problem, either. Today, users still scroll News Feeds that reinforce their views, no matter how problematic. And with the growing tide of misinformation, the News Feed has gone from just <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-vortex-political-polarization/">placing users into a filter bubble</a> to presenting a full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/11/how-2020-transformed-big-tech-the-story-of-facebook-qanon-and-the-worlds-slackening-grip-on-reality">alternate reality</a> for some, often populated by conspiracies theories.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s third test doesn&#8217;t necessarily tackle this problem head-on, but instead looks to gain feedback about what users want to see, as a whole. Facebook says that it will begin asking people whether they want to see more or fewer posts on certain topics, like Cooking, Sports, or Politics, and more. Based on users&#8217; collective feedback, Facebook will adjust its algorithms to show more content people say they&#8217;re interested in, and fewer posts about topics they don&#8217;t want to see.</p>
<p>The area of politics, specifically, has been an issue for Facebook. The social network for years has been charged with helping to fan the flames of political discourse, polarizing and radicalizing users through its algorithms, distributing misinformation at scale, and encouraging an ecosystem of divisive clickbait, as publishers sought engagement instead of fairness and balance when reporting the news. There are now entirely biased and subjective outlets posing as news sources who benefit from algorithms like Facebook&#8217;s, in fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Capitol attack, Facebook announced it would <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">try clamping down on political content</a> in the News Feed for a small percentage of people in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Indonesia, for period of time during tests.</p>
<p>Now, the company says it will work to better understand what content is being linked negative News Feed experiences, including political content. In this case, Facebook may ask users on posts with a lot of negative reactions what sort of content they want to see less of.</p>
<p>It will also more prominently feature the option to hide posts you find &#8220;irrelevant, problematic or irritating.&#8221; Although this feature existed before, you&#8217;ll now be able to tap an X in the upper-right corner of a post to hide it from the News Feed, if in the test group, and see fewer like in the future, for a more personalized experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2142300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear that allowing users to pick and choose their topics is the best way to solve the larger problems with negative posts, divisive content or misinformation, though this test is less about the latter and more about making the News Feed &#8220;feel&#8221; more positive.</p>
<p>As the data is collected from the tests, Facebook will incorporate the learnings into its News Feed ranking algorithms. But it&#8217;s not clear to what extent it will be adjusting the algorithm on a global basis versus simply customizing the experience for end users on a more individual basis over time.</p>
<p>The company says the tests will run over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">That thing I said the other week about robotics SPACs being relatively few and far between is becoming less and less true. It’s like someone walked down to the local robotics club, explained the admittedly somewhat convoluted methods around robotics mergers and the rest of the industry decided that they, too, wanted to get in on this action.</p>
<p>Joining the list that already includes warehouse automation firm Berkshire-Gray and exoskeleton company Sarcos <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005399/en/Vicarious-Surgical-Inc.-and-D8-Holdings-Corp.-Announce-Definitive-Business-Combination-Agreement">is Vicarious Surgical</a>. The surgical category is definitely one to keep an eye on going forward for these deals. Not only is it a massive industry with intricate and expensive procedures, it’s one that’s been proven out for several decades now, thanks in no small part to players like Intuitive, which received FDA approval more than 20 years ago for its da Vinci system.</p>
<p>Vicarious has been kicking around since 2015 and has raised $43.2 million to date. The company’s got some big names in its corner, including Bill Gates via the Gates Frontier Fund, as well as backing from the likes of Marc Benioff. The company utilizes virtual reality so surgical operations can be performed remotely. The SPAC deal values the firm at $1.1 billion and will net Vicarious up to $425 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sizable round <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canvas-announces-24-million-series-b-to-revolutionize-drywall-in-the-construction-industry-with-the-first-collaborative-robotics-solution-301269451.html">from Canvas last week</a>, as well. No, not the autonomous cart company acquired by Amazon Robotics a couple of years back. The San Francisco-based robotic drywall startup raised a $24 million Series B. One of the most interesting things we’re seeing out of the robotics construction space isn’t just the potential size of the industry, but the breadth of applications. There are just so many different places where robotics and automation could play a key role in the future.</p>

<p>One of the bigger surprises of the week is the commercial arrival of ANYbotics&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/the-anymal-inspection-robot-gives-spot-some-four-legged-competition/">ANYmal</a> robot. We’ve seen the quadrupedal robot in a number of different iterations over the years. The comparisons to Boston Dynamics’ Spot system is, of course, unavoidable, though the Swiss company has been working on their proprietary tech for several years now.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s probably not surprising that the first commercial application for the robot is similar to that of Spot. Specifically, it’s designed to patrol potentially unsafe working spaces, including electrical and industrial plants. ANYmal has a customizable array of sensors up top for visual and audio inspections, among others.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2274827-robotic-elephant-trunk-can-learn-new-tasks-on-its-own/">a neat project</a> out of Germany’s University of Tubingen. Researchers designed a robot to mimic the movements of an elephant trunk. This early version is comprised of low-cost (and colorful) 3D-printed components that are capable of grasping a range of different objects. The group hopes to one day adapt the technology for industrial grasping applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has changed the way we work, on so many levels &#8212; a fact from which podcasters certainly weren’t immune. I can say, anecdotally, that as a long-time podcaster, I had thrown in the towel on my long-standing insistence that I do all of my interviews in-person &#8212; for what should probably be obvious reasons.</p>
<p>2020 saw many shows shifting to a remote format and experimenting with different remote recording tools, from broad teleconferencing software like Zoom to more bespoke solutions like Zencastr. Tel Aviv-based Riverside.fm (originally from Amsterdam) launched right on time to ride the remote podcasting wave, and today the service is announcing a $9.5 million Series A.</p>
<p>The round is led by Seven Seven Six and features Zeev-ventures.com, Casey Neistat, Marques Brownlee, Guy Raz,  Elad Gil and Alexander Klöpping. The company says it plans to use the money to increase headcount and build out more features for the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=1536,986 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=2048,1314 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>“As many were forced to adapt to remote work and production teams struggled to deliver the same in person quality, from a distance—Gideon and Nadav saw an opportunity to not only solve a great need for creators, but to build an extraordinary product,” Seven Seven Six founder Alexis Ohanian said in a release. “As a creator myself, I can say from experience that Riverside&#8217;s quality is unmatched and the new editing capabilities are peerless.”</p>
<p>Riverside.fm is a remote video and audio platform that records lossless audio and 4K video tracks remotely to each user’s system, saving the end result from the kind of technical hiccups that come with spotty internet connections.</p>
<p>Along with the funding round, the company is also rolling out a number of software updates to its platform. At the top of the list is brand new version of its iPhone app, which instantly records and uploads video, a nice extension as more users are looking to record their end on mobile devices.</p>
<p>On the desktop front, “Magic Editor” streamlines the multi-step process of recording, editing and uploading. There’s also a new “Smart Speakerview” feature that automatically switches between speakers for video editing, while not switching for accidental noises like sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hot space that&#8217;s only heating up. Given how quickly the company was able to piece their original offering together, it will be interesting to see what they&#8217;re able to do with an additional $9.5 million in their coffers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have a natural fit with sports memorabilia, another category of speculative asset whose value is primarily dependent on the prices its adherents are willing to pay. A new startup called <a href="https://www.sportsicon.co/">SportsIcon</a> aims to deliver even more value via sports-focused NFTs, with direct collaboration with athletes and lessons from the pros to accompany the one-off digital collectibles.</p>
<p>SportsIcon has backing from Roham Gharegozlou, the CEO of Dapper Labs, which was at the very forefront of the NFT craze and which powers NBA Top Shot. It&#8217;s also funded by rapper Nas, whose portfolio includes a number of prescient early bets, former NBA player Andrew Bogut, Eniac Ventures&#8217; Partner Nihal Mehta and more. The company announced its initial round of funding along with its public launch, but declined to disclose the total amount, noting only that it was &#8220;in the seven figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, SportsIcon will be debuting between 15 and 20 NFTs, created in collaboration with athletes, that commemorate specific, historic moments from their sporting careers. Accompanying these NFTs will be &#8220;two-hour masterclasses,&#8221; which the company said in a press release will give &#8220;fans access to their mental and physical training methods, techniques and best practices.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That masterclass approach is due in part to the background of co-founder Chris Worsey, who previously built a number of edtech startups including Coursematch. Worsey told TechCrunch that the key to its approach lies in the exclusive content that will be packaged along with the NFTs it&#8217;s bringing to market. SportsIcon is differentiated because it’s creating unique content, shooting for two days with the athlete — the first day will be “interviews about their journey and their past,” the second day will be shooting them on the training field, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YhZ2ZsPMeU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/will-topps-spac-led-debut-expand-the-bustling-nft-market/">Will Topps&#8217; SPAC-led debut expand the bustling NFT market?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Topps&#8217; SPAC-led debut expand the bustling NFT market?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/will-topps-spac-led-debut-expand-the-bustling-nft-market/embed/#?secret=YhZ2ZsPMeU" data-secret="YhZ2ZsPMeU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“This is the key: The beauty is the built-in scarcity of this content,&#8221; Worsey added. &#8220;We won’t be releasing it elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope is to build a “long-term relationship with the icons,” he explained, while the exact financial details/split will differ from deal to deal. In some cases, the athlete is donating their proceeds to the charity of their choice. Each unique art piece will be auctioned off, and the packs will sell for anywhere from $10 to $999. The more expensive packs will be “the really rare, scarce moments where the icon’s talking about their greatest moments,” according to Worsey. Packs can also include real-world prizes like signed memorabilia or box seats at a game.</p>
<p>The real differentiator for SportsIcon, he says, is down to the focus on content, and creating something that&#8217;s not only unique, but also high-quality.</p>
<p>“SportsIcon is different because we invest in the content,&#8221; Worsey told TechCrunch. &#8220;We hire world-class directors and we make world-class content.”</p>
<p>While the startup isn&#8217;t yet revealing any of the athletes its working with on its debut NFTs, it says the first sports stars that will appear on the platform will come from soccer, tennis, MMA, basketball and baseball, with agreements with stars in each of those areas currently in progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, the company that’s building an immersive XR in-vehicle media platform, today announced it raised €10 million (approximately $12 million) in its Series A investing round, earning the company a €30 million ($36 million) valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swedish ADAS software development company Terranet led the round with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€3.2 million (~$3.9 million), followed by a group of Chinese financial and automotive technology investors, organized by investment professional Jingjing Xu, and educational and entertainment game development company Schell Games, which has partnered with holoride in the past to create content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride will use the fresh funds to search for new developers and other talent both as it prepares to expand into global markets like Europe, the United States and Asia, and in advance of its summer 2022 launch for private passenger cars. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This goes hand-in-hand with putting more emphasis on the content creator community, and as of summer this year, releasing a lot of tools to help them build content for cars on our platform,” Nils Wollny, holoride’s CEO and founder, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Munich-based company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched at CES in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/i-used-vr-in-a-car-going-90mph-and-didnt-get-sick/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TechCrunch got to test out its in-car virtual reality system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our team was surprised, and delighted, to find that holoride had figured out how to quell the motion sickness caused both by being a passenger in a vehicle, and by using a VR headset. The key? Matching the experience users have within the headset to the movement of the vehicle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once holoride launches, users will be able to download the holoride app to their phones or other personal devices like VR headsets, which will connect wirelessly to the car itself, and extend their reality.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology has two sides,” said Wollny. “One is the localization, or positioning software, that takes data points from the car and performs real time synchronization. The other part is what we call our Elastic Software Development Kit. Content creators can build elastic content, which adapts to your travel time and routes. The collaboration with Terranet means their sensors and software stack that allow for a more precise capture and interpretation of the environment at an even faster speed with higher accuracy will enable us in the future for even more possibilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> software, which was originally designed for ADAS applications, will help holoride advance its real time, in-vehicle XR entertainment. Terranet’s CEO Par-olof Johannesson, describes VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> as a new paradigm within computer vision and object identification, wherein a combination of sensors, event cameras and a laser scanner are integrated into a car’s windshield and headlamps in order to calculate the distance, direction and speed of an object.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138924" style="width: 3810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138924" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2138924 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg" alt="" width="3800" height="2649" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg 3800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=768,535 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=1536,1071 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=2048,1428 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Terranet-VoxelFlow-Landscape.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3800px) 100vw, 3800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138924" class="wp-caption-text">Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> uses computer vision and object identification via a combination of sensors, event cameras and a laser scanner, which are integrated into a car’s windshield and headlamps, in order to calculate the distance, direction and speed of an object.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, which is manufacturer-agnostic, will be able to use the data points calculated by VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> in real time if holoride were being used in a vehicle that was built integrated with Terranet&#8217;s software. But more important is the ability for holoride to reuse 3D event data for XR applications, giving it to creators so they can create the most interactive experience. Terranet is also looking forward to opening up a new vertical for VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are of course very eager to access holoride’s wide pipeline, as well,” said Johannesson. “This deal is very much about expanding the addressable market and tapping into the heart of the automotive industry, where lead times and turnaround times are usually pretty long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride is on a mission to revolutionize the passenger experience by turning dead car time into interactive experiences that can run the gamut of gaming, education, productivity, mindfulness and more. For example, around Halloween 2019, <a href="https://www.holoride.com/news/bride/">holoride teamed up with Ford and Universal Pictures</a> to immerse riders into the frightening world of the Bride of Frankenstein, replete with monsters jumping out and tasks for riders to perform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wollny said holoride always has an eye towards the next step, even though its first product hasn’t gone to market yet. He understands that the future is in autonomous vehicles, and wants to build an essential element of the future tech stack of future cars, cars in which everyone is a passenger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Car manufacturers always focus on the buyer of the car or the driver, but not so much on the passenger,” said Wollny. “The passenger is who holoride really focuses on. We want to turn every vehicle into a moving theme park.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.appliedxl.com">AppliedXL</a>, a startup creating machine learning tools with what it describes as a journalistic lens, is announcing that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/newlab-boston-globe-applied-xlabs/">Emerging from the Newlab Venture Studio last year</a>, the company is led by CEO Francesco Marconi (previously R&amp;D chief at The Wall Street Journal) and CTO Erin Riglin (former WSJ automation editor). Marconi told me that AppliedXL started out by working on a number of different data and machine learning projects as it looked for product-market fit — but it&#8217;s now ready to focus on its first major industry, life sciences, with a product launching broadly this summer.</p>
<p>He said that AppliedXL&#8217;s technology consists of &#8220;essentially a swarm of editorial algorithms developed by computational journalists.&#8221; These algorithms benefit from &#8220;the point of view and expertise of journalists, as well as taking into account things like transparency and bias and other issues that derive from straightforward machine learning development.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Marconi compared the startup to Bloomberg and Dow Jones, suggesting that just as those companies were able to collect and standardize financial data, AppliedXL will do the same in a variety of other industries.</p>
<p>He suggested that it makes sense to start with life sciences because there&#8217;s both a clear need and high demand. Customers might include competitive intelligence teams as pharmaceutical companies and life sciences funds, which might normally try to track this data by searching large databases and receiving &#8220;data vomit&#8221; in response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our solution for scaling [the ability to spot] newsworthy events is to design the algorithms with the same principles that a journalist would approach a story or an investigation,&#8221; Marconi said. &#8220;It might be related to the size of the study and the number of patients, it might be related to a drug that is receiving a lot of attention in terms of R&amp;D investment. All of these criteria that science journalist would bring to clinical trials, we&#8217;re encoding that into algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Marconi said the startup could expand into other categories, building industry-&#8220;micro models.&#8221; Broadly speaking, he suggested that the company&#8217;s mission is &#8220;measuring the health of people, places and the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seed funding was led by Tuesday Capital, with participation from Frog Ventures, Correlation Ventures, Team Europe (the investment arm of Delivery Hero co-founder Lukasz Gadowski) and Ringier executive Robin Lingg.</p>
<p>&#8220;With industry leading real-time data pipelining, Applied XL is building the tools and platform for the next generation of data-based decision making that business leaders will rely on for decades,&#8221; said Tuesday Capital Partner Prashant Fonseka in a statement. &#8220;Data is the new oil and the team at Applied XL have figured out how to identify, extract and leverage one of the most valuable commodities in the world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, having an automated solution for onboarding and updating Apple devices remotely has been essential, and today <a href="https://kandji.io/">Kandji</a>, a startup that helps IT do just that, announced a hefty $60 million Series B investment.</p>
<p>Felicis Ventures led the round with participation from SVB Capital, Greycroft, Okta Ventures and The Spruce House Partnership. Today&#8217;s round comes just 7 months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/kandji-hauls-in-21m-series-a-as-apple-device-management-flourishes-during-pandemic/">a $21 million Series A</a>, bringing the total raised across three rounds to $88.5 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>CEO Adam Pettit says that the company has been growing in leaps and bounds since the funding round last October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot more traction than even originally anticipated. I think every time we&#8217;ve put targets up onto the board of how quickly we would grow, we&#8217;ve accelerated past them,&#8221; he said. He said that one of the primary reasons for this growth has been the rapid move to work from home during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working with customers across 40+ industries now, and we&#8217;re even seeing international customers come in and purchase so everyone now is just looking to support remote workforces and we provide a really elegant way for them to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UKLUuI3sIL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/companies-secure-work-from-home-coronavirus/">Maintain data security when staff is working from home</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maintain data security when staff is working from home&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/companies-secure-work-from-home-coronavirus/embed/#?secret=UKLUuI3sIL" data-secret="UKLUuI3sIL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Pettit didn&#8217;t want to discuss exact revenue numbers, he did say that it has tripled since the Series A announcement. That is being fueled in part he says by attracting larger companies, and he says they have been seeing more and more of them become customers this year.</p>
<p>As they&#8217;ve grown revenue and added customers, they&#8217;ve also brought on new employees, growing from 40 to 100 since October. Pettit says that the startup is committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture at the company and a big part of that is making sure you have a diverse pool of candidates to choose from.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes down to at the onset just making the decision that it&#8217;s important to you and it&#8217;s important to the company, which we&#8217;ve done. Then you take it step by step all the way through, and we start at the back into the funnel where our candidates are coming from.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means clearly telling their recruiting partners that they want a diverse candidate pool. One way to do that is being remote and having a broader talent pool to work with. &#8220;We realized that in order to hold true to [our commitment], it was going to be really hard to do that just sticking to the core market of San Diego or San Francisco, and so now we&#8217;ve expand expanded nationally and this has opened up a lot of [new] pools of top tech talent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pettit is thinking hard right now about how the startup will run its offices whenever they are allowed back, especially with some employees living outside major tech hubs. Clearly it will have some remote component, but he says that the tricky part of that will be making sure that the folks who aren&#8217;t coming into the office still feel fully engaged and part of the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I’ve been playing around with Apple’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">AirTag location devices</a> for a few hours now and they seem to work pretty much as advertised. The setup flow is simple and clean, taking clear inspiration from the one Apple developed for AirPods. The precision finding feature enabled by the U1 chip works as a solid example of utility-driven augmented reality, popping up a virtual arrow and other visual identifiers on the screen to make finding a tag quicker.</p>
<p class="p1">The basic way that AirTags work, if you’re not familiar, is that they use Bluetooth beaconing technology to announce their presence to any nearby devices running iOS 14.5 and above. These quiet pings are encrypted and invisible (usually) to any passer by, especially if they are with their owners. This means that no one ever knows what device actually ‘located’ your AirTag, not even Apple.</p>

<p class="p1">With you, by the way, means in relative proximity to a device signed in to the iCloud account that the AirTags are registered to. Bluetooth range is typically in the ~40 foot range depending on local conditions and signal bounce.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In my very limited testing so far, AirTag location range fits in with that basic Bluetooth expectation. Which means that it can be foiled by a lot of obstructions or walls or an unflattering signal bounce. It often took 30 seconds or more to get an initial location from an AirTag in another room, for instance. Once the location was received, however, the instructions to locate the device seemed to update quickly and were <i>extremely </i>accurate down to a few inches.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The AirTags run for a year on a standard CR2032 battery that&#8217;s user replaceable. They offer some water resistance including submersion for some time. There are a host of accessories that seem nicely designed like leather straps for bags, luggage tags and key rings. Also, to answer a question I got a lot yesterday: no, this functionality is inexplicably not built into the new Apple TV remote.</p>
<p>In this shot of the disassembled AirTag you can see Apple&#8217;s extensive hardware obsession on display. The battery contacts inside the casing are not simple bend prongs as is normal for small devices, instead, the contact is made via the internal casing clasps and a set of three pressure contacts. This should improve longevity as they are less likely to get tweaked or bent during a battery replacement or lose contact over time.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Some protections</b></p>
<p>As with anything to do with location, security and privacy are a top of mind situation for AirTags, and Apple has some protections in place.</p>
<p class="p1">You cannot share AirTags — they are meant to be owned by one person. The only special privileges offered by people in your iCloud Family Sharing Group is that they can silence the ‘unknown AirTag nearby’ alerts indefinitely. This makes AirTags useful for things like shared sets of keys or maybe even a family pet. This means that AirTags will not show up on your family Find My section like other iOS devices might. There is now a discrete section within the app just for &#8216;Items&#8217; including those with Find My functionality built in.</p>

<p class="p1">The other privacy features include a ‘warning’ that will trigger after some time that a tag is in your proximity and NOT in the proximity of its owner (aka, traveling with you perhaps in a bag or car). Your choices are then to make the tag play a sound to locate it — look at its information including serial number and to disable it by removing its battery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Any AirTag that has been away from its owner for a while — this time is currently 3 days but is variable and Apple could tweak it over time as it observes how AirTags work — will start playing a sound whenever it is moved. This will alert people to its presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">You can, of course, also place an AirTag into Lost Mode, offering a choice to share personal information with anyone who locates it as it plays an alert sound. Anyone with any smart device with NFC, Android included, can tap the device to see a webpage with information that you choose to share. Or just a serial number if you do not choose to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This scenario addresses what happens if you <i>don’t</i> have an iOS device to alert you to a foreign AirTag in your presence, as it will eventually play a sound even if it is not in lost mode and the owner has no control over that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png"><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignright size-medium wp-image-2142237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?w=139" alt="" width="139" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0843.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It’s clear that Apple has thought through many of the edge cases, but some could still crop up as it rolls out, we’ll have to see.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple has some distinct market advantages here:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Nearly a billion devices out in the world that can help to locate an AirTag.</li>
<li class="li1">A built-in U1 wideband chip that communicates with a similar U1 chip in iPhones to enable super precise (down to inches) location.</li>
<li class="li1">A bunch of privacy features that don’t appear on competing tags.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Important to note that Apple has announced the development of a specification for chipset makers that lets third-party devices with Ultra Wideband radios access the U1 chip onboard iPhones ‘later this Spring’. This should approximate the Precision Finding feature’s utility in accessories that don’t have the advantage of having a U1 built in like the AirTags do. And, of course, Apple has opened up the entire Find My mesh network to third party devices from Belkin, Chipolo and VanMoof that want to offer a similar basic finding function as offered by AirTags. Tile has announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">offer a UWB version</a> of its tracker as well, even as it testified in Congress yesterday that Apple’s advantages <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">made its entry into this market unfair.</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It will be interesting to see these play out once AirTags are out getting lost in the wild. I have had them for under 12 hours so I’ve not been able to test edge cases, general utility in public spaces or anything like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The devices go on sale on April 23rd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A clutch of the world&#8217;s largest consumer products and food companies are joining Budweiser&#8217;s parent company <a href="https://www.ab-inbev.com/">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a> in backing an investment program to support early stage companies focused on making supply chains more sustainable.</p>
<p>The Earth Day-timed announcement comes as companies and consumers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled">confront the failure of recycling programs</a> to adequately address the problems associated with plastic waste &#8212; and broader issues around the contributions of consumer behavior and industrial production and distribution <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033310-800-climate-emergency-the-new-science-showing-its-make-or-break-time/">to the current climate emergency</a>.</p>
<p>The AB InBev program, called the <a href="https://www.100accelerator.com/">100+ Accelerator</a>, launched in 2018 with the goal to solve supply chain challenges in water stewardship, the circular economy, sustainable agriculture and climate action, the company said. These are problems that the alcohol manufacturer&#8217;s new partners &#8212; Colgate-Palmolive; Coca-Cola; and Unilever are also intimately familiar with.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the launch of the accelerator and investment program, AB InBev has backed 36 companies in 16 countries, according to a statement. Those startups have gone on to raise more than $200 million in follow on financing.</p>
<p>The accelerator program creates funding for pilot programs and offers opportunities for early stage companies to consult with executive management at the world&#8217;s top consumer brands.</p>
<p>Since the program&#8217;s launch, AB InBev has worked with startups to pilot returnable packaging programs; implement new cleaning technologies to reduce water and energy use in Colombian brewing operations; provide insurance to small farms in Africa and South America; collect more waste in Brazil; recycle electric vehicle batteries in China; and upcycle grains waste from the brewing process to create new, nutrient rich food sources.</p>
<p>As pressures from outside investors and regulators mount, companies are beginning to shift their attention to focus on ways to make their industrial processes more sustainable.</p>
<p>These kinds of collaborative initiatives among major corporations, which are long overdue, have the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing the environmental footprint of business, but it depends on the depth of the commitment and the speed at which these businesses are willing to deploy solutions beyond a few small pilot programs.</p>
<p>Applications for the latest cohort will be due by May 31, 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Internet of Things has a security problem. The past decade has seen wave after wave of new internet-connected devices, from sensors through to webcams and smart home tech, often manufactured in bulk but with little — if any — consideration to security. Worse, many device manufacturers make no effort to fix security flaws, while others simply leave out the software update mechanisms needed to deliver patches altogether.</p>
<p>That sets up an entire swath of insecure and unpatchable devices to fail, and destined to be thrown out when they break down or are invariably hacked.</p>
<p>Security veteran Window Snyder thinks there is a better way. Her new startup, <a href="https://www.thistle.tech/">Thistle Technologies</a>, is backed with $2.5 million in seed funding from True Ventures with the goal of helping IoT manufacturers reliably and securely deliver software updates to their devices.</p>
<p>Snyder founded Thistle last year, and named it after the flowering plant with sharp prickles designed to deter animals from eating them. &#8220;It&#8217;s a defense mechanism,&#8221; Snyder told TechCrunch, a name that&#8217;s fitting for a defensive technology company. The startup aims to help device manufacturers without the personnel or resources to integrate update mechanisms into their device&#8217;s software in order to receive security updates and better defend against security threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building the means so that they don&#8217;t have to do it themselves. They want to spend the time building customer-facing features anyway,&#8221; said Snyder. Prior to founding Thistle, Snyder worked in senior cybersecurity positions at Apple, Intel, and Microsoft, and also served as chief security officer at Mozilla, Square, and Fastly.</p>
<p>Thistle lands on the security scene at a time when IoT needs it most. Botnet operators are known to scan the internet for devices with weak default passwords and hijack their internet connections to pummel victims <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/">with floods of internet traffic</a>, knocking entire websites and networks offline. In 2016, a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service attack launched by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/">the Mirai botnet</a> on internet infrastructure giant Dyn knocked some of the biggest websites — Shopify, SoundCloud, Spotify, Twitter — offline for hours. Mirai had ensnared thousands of IoT devices into its network at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>Other malicious hackers target IoT devices as a way to get a foot into a victim&#8217;s network, allowing them to launch attacks or plant malware from the inside.</p>
<p>Since device manufacturers have done little to solve their security problems among themselves, lawmakers are looking at legislating to curb some of the more egregious security mistakes made by default manufacturers, like using default — and often unchangeable — passwords and selling devices with no way to deliver security updates.</p>
<p>California <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">paved the way</a> after passing an IoT security law in 2018, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/uks-iot-security-by-design-law-will-cover-smartphones-too/">the U.K. following</a> shortly after in 2019. The U.S. has no federal law governing basic IoT security standards.</p>
<p>Snyder said the push to introduce IoT cybersecurity laws could be &#8220;an easy way for folks to get into compliance&#8221; without having to hire fleets of security engineers. Having an update mechanism in place also helps to keeps the IoT devices around for longer — potentially for years longer — simply by being able to push fixes and new features.</p>
<p>&#8220;To build the infrastructure that&#8217;s going to allow you to continue to make those devices resilient and deliver new functionality through software, that&#8217;s an incredible opportunity for these device manufacturers. And so I&#8217;m building a security infrastructure company to support that security needs,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>With the seed round in the bank, Snyder said the company is focused on hiring device and back-end engineers, product managers, and building new partnerships with device manufacturers.</p>
<p>Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures — Thistle&#8217;s seed round investor — described the company as &#8220;an astute and natural next step in security technologies.&#8221; He added: “Window has so many of the qualities we look for in founders. She has deep domain expertise, is highly respected within the security community, and she’s driven by a deep passion to evolve her industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.outlier.org">Outlier.org</a> — a startup offering intro-level college courses online and at a relatively affordable price — is announcing that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by CEO Aaron Rasmussen, previously co-founder at MasterClass (which <a href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html">Axios reports</a> is raising new funding at a $2.5 billion valuation). Like Rasmussen&#8217;s old company, Outlier offers beautifully shot online courses; unlike MasterClass, students can actually earn college credit.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/outlier-launch/">Outlier launched in the fall of 2019</a>, Rasmussen said his goal was to make a college education more affordable and accessible — though he also told me that Outlier is only focused on bringing intro-level classes online, not the entire curriculum.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This idea seems even more appealing during a pandemic, when a completely &#8220;normal&#8221; college experience isn&#8217;t really available to anyone. In fact, Rasmussen said there&#8217;s been a surge in interest from universities that want to partner with Outlier, especially since some colleges are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/colleges-covid-applicants.html">struggling to attract students</a> — so with difficult financial choices ahead, they can use Outlier to supplement their offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve learned that many universities love the idea of high-quality intro classes for students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was a question mark for us, [but] many say, &#8216;We want to focus on upper level courses, so this is a great way to keep people on track.'&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yyOcxi4hLq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/outlier-launch/">MasterClass founder launches Outlier, offering online courses for college credit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MasterClass founder launches Outlier, offering online courses for college credit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/outlier-launch/embed/#?secret=yyOcxi4hLq" data-secret="yyOcxi4hLq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, Outlier has hired Anjuli Gupta as its head of partnerships. Gupta previously led university partnerships at Coursera, and Rasmussen suggested the company could work with high schools and employers, not just universities.</p>
<p>Of course, the pandemic has created some challenges for Outlier as well. Initially, in order to continue producing its classes, Rasmussen said the company was shipping its instructors &#8220;literally 500 pounds of cinematography equipment.&#8221; Now it has developed a production method where a small crew sets everything up, then the instructor teaches on the set alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just you, a motion-controlled dolly and little pieces of tape telling you where to push all the buttons,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then [the crew] remotely runs the cameras, you’re hitting record and they can see everything coming in through the feeds, so you&#8217;re remotely directed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outlier currently offers six classes, including Calculus I, Microeconomics, Astronomy and Philosophy, with a goal of expanding to 14 by the end of 2022. Rasmussen said the company is now allowing students to join courses in new cohorts every two weeks — so even though the lectures are pre-recorded, you&#8217;re still moving through the class with a group of fellow students. And Outlier has built a variety of custom student support tools — for example, the company can identify when a student is &#8220;falling behind&#8221; and reach out to offer more support.</p>
<p>The startup has also expanded its partnership with the University of Pittsburgh into a five-year agreement, with students receiving credit from the school and faculty at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown providing academic oversight. (Though it seems that <a href="https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/outlier-arrangement-pitt">some faculty members are unhappy about the arrangement</a>.) They&#8217;ve also partnered to offer <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-university-of-pittsburgh-and-outlierorg-announce-1-000-scholarships-for-frontline-workers-301176983.html">$3.8 million worth of scholarships</a> to 1,000 frontline workers.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNMiAPTZvDM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Each Outlier course costs $400, which the company says is approximately one-sixth the cost of a traditional college class. Still, Rasmussen said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have afforded it when I was growing up,&#8221; so he&#8217;s trying to find ways to make the program even more affordable — hence the scholarships, as well as monthly payment plans with Klarna (Outlier covers the interest on student payments).</p>
<p>The new funding was led by GV (formerly known Google Ventures), with participation from Unusual Ventures, GSV, Harrison Metal and Gaingels, bringing Outlier&#8217;s total funding to $46 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re inspired by Outlier.org’s mission to increase educational access and equity, and to reduce student debt,” said GV&#8217;s John Lyman in a statement. “We strongly believe in Aaron Rasmussen and the founding team’s vision to provide better access to more affordable education for hundreds of millions of students around the globe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is announcing some new capabilities for video advertisers on Facebook and Instagram, as well as new numbers about the potential audience that those ads might reach.</p>
<p>Numbers first: The company says that there are now 2 billion people each month who watch videos that eligible for in-stream ads. It also says that 70 percent of in-stream ads are watched to completion, with its studies showing that by adding a Facebook In-Stream campaign to ad purchases that already include News Feed and Stories, advertisers saw a median 1.5x increase in ad recall.</p>
<p>When discussing the news with Carolyn Everson, the vice president of Facebook&#8217;s global business group, I wondered whether traditional advertisers are comfortable with the company&#8217;s metrics. (Back in 2016, the company had to admit that due to an error, it had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/">inflating video view times</a>, and is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-for-years-ad-reach-estimates-were-based-on-wrong-data-but-blocked-fixes-over-revenue-impact-per-court-filing/">facing criticism</a> about how it handled the situation.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everson said Facebook is aiming to be &#8220;very specific&#8221; with its numbers. She also noted that the company only places in-stream ads in videos that are three minutes or longer, with the ad only playing after a viewer has watched at least 45 seconds (or more, depending on the video).</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe that we are going to be very competitive and consistent with the marketplace,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Everyone measures these things a little bit differently, but these are numbers that people are going to be very excited about.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142057" style="width: 426px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142057" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2142057" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?w=416" alt="Facebook Video Topics" width="416" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=768,1254 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=416,680 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=941,1536 941w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Guidance-1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142057" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>On the product side, the company is starting a global test of In-Stream Video Topics, which will allow advertisers to target their ads not just by audience, but also based on the topic of a given video. In a blog post, Facebook says the initial targeting will include &#8220;over 20 Video Topics, like Sports, and over 700 hundred sub-topics such as Baseball, Basketball, Golf, or Swimming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everson said the company will use machine learning technology to classify eligible videos, as well as to ensure that they meet Facebook&#8217;s brand safety guidelines.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook is announcing that it will start testing ads in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/"> its short-form Instagram Reels format</a>, initially in India, Brazil, Germany and Australia. These ads can be up to 30 seconds long, and users can interact with them in the same ways they interact with organic Reels content (liking, sharing, skipping).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142060" style="width: 377px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142060" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2142060 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StickerAd_GIF.gif?w=367" alt="" width="367" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142060" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook sticker ads</p></div></p>
<p>And Facebook is testing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/facebook-is-bringing-ads-to-shorter-videos-and-stories/">the sticker ads that it announced last month</a>, which will allow brands to create custom stickers, which creators can then include in their Facebook Stories.</p>
<p>Looking at all the announcements together, Everson (who joined Facebook in 2011) said, &#8220;Frankly, for the last 10 years, I’ve been so excited for the moment where we are absolutely ready for prime time in our discussions of online video solutions for marketers. With our news that we are announcing today, we have more than arrived.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Debt is the new equity. As founders run around trying to fend off prying VCs from their cap tables, they are increasingly turning to debt products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/saas-securitization/">revenue-based securities</a> in order to get the capital they need today while protecting them from dilution they don’t want tomorrow. It’s a huge business, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/pipe-which-aims-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue-raises-more-money-at-a-2b-valuation/">leading company Pipe just valued at $2 billion</a> and others <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/capchase-nabs-60m-in-credit-to-help-founders-avoid-dilution/">like CapChase cashing in on founders’ newly-found love of debt</a>.</p>
<p>All those new securities creates a dilemma for potential investors: how do they evaluate every single new debt product from every single company? It’s a problem they face not just in the startup world, but also private debt in general as companies borrow hundreds of billions of dollars per year. The solution is securitization and syndication, aggregating the small debts from multiple companies and fusing them together into one consistent new security. It’s a major component of capital markets, but one that remains mired in legacy business practices.</p>
<p><a href="https://mypercent.com">Percent</a> is building an end-to-end technology securitization platform for debt originators to connect with a much wider network of investors than traditional institutions to get the best rates at the fastest speeds. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/securitization-platform-cadence-surpasses-125m-deal-volume-and-raises-4m/">When we last checked in a year ago with the company</a>, previously known as Cadence, it had just raised $4 million and had processed $125 million through its platform in its short lifetime.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Well, it has now structured more than $400 million across its platform, an eye-popping performance that has attracted new VC interest, this time from Sep Alavi at White Star Capital and Karen Page at B Capital. The two firms are investing $12.5 million in a Series A into Percent, with previous backers Revel Partners and Recharge Capital participating.</p>
<p>For CFOs, Percent’s pitch is that it can offer a wider spectrum of private debt buyers to originators, therefore lowering the cost of capital. The traditional corporate debt world remains quite clubby, with major institutional holders being connected to originators through investment banks. High fees and a limited investor base can raise expenses significantly. Through its platform, Percent can break that clubbiness and open the debt world to a wider range of buyers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Percent also acts as the deal origination and transaction platform, allowing companies to easily put together debt offerings, process requests for information, and avoid the sort of “attach Excel financials to email or upload to cloud” workflow that remains a mainstay in these processes.</p>
<p>Percent’s business model is to take a percentage fee on the dollars originated on its platform as well as an additional percentage fee if it is the underwriter itself. In this way, it has essentially a recurring-revenue model — the more debt that is transacted on its platform, the more continuous revenue the company generates over time.</p>
<p>Percent scored one of its biggest wins to date with <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/20/2213775/0/en/FAT-Brands-Inc-Announces-Completion-of-144-Million-Whole-Business-Securitization-Transaction.html">the securitization of $144 million in debt originated by FAT Brands</a>, the owners of popular restaurant franchises like Fatburger and Johnny Rockets. Percent acted as co-lead bookrunner with lead Jefferies for the debt announced yesterday, and FAT noted that its cost of capital was significantly lower than its previous two securitizations from last year. Given the changing macro environment and the radically shifting fortunes in the foods service business in the wake of COVID-19 though, it is hard to precisely identify what changed the cost of capital and what extent a modern technology stack helped the company’s debt performance. Outside of FAT Brands, Percent <a href="https://mypercent.com/originators/">has a list of many of its other originators available</a>.</p>
<p>Nelson Chu, the founder and CEO of Percent, noted that he was particularly interested in finding investors with knowledge of capital markets and the enterprise sales cycle. He observed in an interview that as more and more VCs in recent years have tended to come from product and growth roles at startups rather than the traditional path through an investment bank, there are fewer VCs with knowledge or interest in the capital markets space.</p>
<p>Alavi at White Star has invested in a range of financial services and blockchain companies, while Page at B Capital has long been in the enterprise space at Apple and as an early employee at cloud provider Box.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of our favorite companies from the most recently Y Combinator batch has closed a seed round. This morning <a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a> announced that it has closed a $2.262 million round, following its $800,000 pre-seed raise. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">covered the company in February</a>, noting that the company was building something akin to the StockX for women&#8217;s formal wear.</p>
<p>Queenly runs a marketplace that allows individuals and small stores to resell dresses after they&#8217;ve been worn, allowing for more women to access the items they want to wear to a prom, quinceanera, or pageant at a lower price point. And as the service could help reduce net clothing waste, it could have a positive environmental impact as well.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The model has continued to find backers. According to co-founder </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/trisherrr?lang=en">Trisha Bantigue</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the biggest check in Queenly&#8217;s seed round came from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://dragoncapital.vc/">Dragon Capital</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, an investing group that she said quickly saw her startup&#8217;s potential, investing the day after they met. Notably, the seed round, which Bantigue had roughly half-filled even before its Y Combinator cohort&#8217;s launch event, did not have a lead investor. Instead, she described her most recent backers as more of a collection of investors that can bring different strategic value-adds to Queenly.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://brightlane.co/">Brightlane Ventures</a> put capital in, for example. Bantigue said that they provide candidate sourcing help. She also cited <a href="https://www.aminocapital.com/">Amino Capital&#8217;s</a> analytics knowledge, which will help her company&#8217;s technical co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhoukathy/">Kathy Zhou</a>. <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a> also invested, an investor that Bantigue said had deep experience in resale marketplaces and commerce. <a href="https://interlaceventures.com/">Interlace Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.shakticapital.com/">Shakti Capital</a> also took part.</p>
<p>Queenly, long a team of <em>two</em>, intends to expand its staff to six full-time workers with its new funds. That means that Zhou will be supplemented by two more engineers, and Bantigue will be backed up by a head of growth, and a head of opps. Six full-time staff isn&#8217;t many, unless you&#8217;re starting from a base of two. Then it&#8217;s a trebling.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JDQA4W6z2e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">YC-backed Queenly launches a marketplace for formalwear</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Queenly launches a marketplace for formalwear&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/embed/#?secret=JDQA4W6z2e" data-secret="JDQA4W6z2e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Queenly had set out to raise $1.5 million, but wound up raising $2.1 million, a number that grew to $2.262 million by the time that TechCrunch caught up with the company earlier this week.</p>
<p>Notably, Bantigue turned down a larger, $1.5 million check after closing around $1.1 million of the round. Why not on as much capital as possible? She said that Y Combinator and its managing director Michael Seibel had warned her startup cohort against raising too much money too early. And, she explained, her team is more focused on building long-term more &#8220;sustainable&#8221; growth than short-term &#8220;hypergrowth.&#8221; She cited startups that raised lots of capital quickly only to later burn out as a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>The new capital was raised using a simple agreement for future equity, or SAFE at a single cap.</p>
<p>Queenly&#8217;s model of allowing individuals and partner stores resale dresses provides it with two distinct supply sources. TechCrunch asked which is its key driver of growth. Per Bantigue, the partner selling model is still new, but thus far has yielded a simpler, and lower-friction supply source for her company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was also curious about how the company handles quality, fraud and returns, especially in light of our recent, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">illustrative dive into StockX</a> which has a related set of hurdles to clear.</p>
<p>Bantigue explained that her firm has two main ways that dresses are vetted. For those priced at $300 or less, they ship directly from sellers to buyers, after submitting proof photos of the condition of the dress&#8217;s components. Those that cost more than $300 are routed through the company&#8217;s own operation, where it can provide stricter quality control.</p>
<p>With more capital than it has ever had, a growing team, and a large market that is largely offline today, the startup should have plenty of room to grow. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with this new investment.</p>
