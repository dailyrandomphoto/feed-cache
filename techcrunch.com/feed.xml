										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember that story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/virgin-galactic-looks-to-late-september-early-october-for-first-commercial-crewed-flight/">we posted earlier today</a> about Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight scheduled to launch in September?</p>
<p>We may have spoken too soon. This afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was grounding all Virgin Galactic flights until further notice, pending the results of the investigation into the company’s July 11 crewed flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the July 11 mission was completed with no injuries to staff or crew, including the company’s billionaire founder Richard Branson, it was recently uncovered that the spaceplane deviated its trajectory outside of cleared airspace. During flight, a red warning light came on the spaceplane’s dashboard, indicating that it went off its planned trajectory. The spaceplane flew off-course for a total of 1 minute and 41 seconds, the FAA said. The deviation was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator went on to add: “The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations. The FAA is overseeing the Virgin Galactic investigation of its July 11 SpaceShipTwo mishap that occurred over Spaceport America, New Mexico. SpaceShipTwo deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.”</p>
<p>Depending on whether the investigation is complete – and what it finds – that first commercial flight in September may stay stuck on the ground. That flight is supposed to send members of the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council to the edges of space, in order to study the effects on transitioning to microgravity on the human body. But until then, Richard Branson’s supersonic company has to stay grounded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was fascinated by Roli the first time I saw founder/CEO Roland Lamb bending the keys of the Seaboard back at SXSW in 2013. Over the years, the London-based company has continued to offer creative musical solutions, including 2016’s modular Blocks system.</p>
<p>Of course, creativity and runaway startup success don’t go hand in hand as often as we’d like to think. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">A BI profile</a> on the company notes some of Roli’s recent struggles, referencing a “niche” product set, which is probably fair. In spite of earning some high-profile fans in the music industry and tech press, the company’s devices were seemingly not destined for mainstream success.</p>
<p>That, coupled, with ongoing pandemic struggles, have forced Roli to take somewhat evasive action, filing for administration in the U.K. Lamb and his 70 or so employees will keep the Roli dream alive by way of a spinout called Luminary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1548243" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1548243" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1548243 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1548243" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roli</p></div></p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Lamb and company to discuss precisely what that means, though we do know that Luminary will be the new home for both Roli’s intellectual property and its debts. All told, Roli raised north of $75 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products we initially developed, although successful within their marketplace, the marketplace wasn&#8217;t big enough given our venture trajectory,” Lamb said in an interview. &#8220;We had our eyes set on hypergrowth and that proved to be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most recently, Roli announced Lumi, a more mainstream offering than its predecessors, which aimed to teach users the piano with light-up keys. The product will be a focus for the similarly named Luminary, along with plans to continue to offer its original Seaboard product under the new banner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beleaguered electric truck developer Nikola Corp. has inked a new agreement with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola’s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper.</p>
<p>“This announcement is the result of a multi-year working relationship with Bosch,” Nikola CEO Mark Russell said in a statement. “After extensive analysis of the best options out there, we are proud to enter into this strategic relationship with Bosch.”</p>
<p>The news is a positive sign for the relationship between the two companies, which has not always been smooth. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola’s European operations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s9l2WHdw2c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/whats-fueling-hydrogen-tech/">What&#8217;s fueling hydrogen tech?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://nikolamotor.com/">Nikola</a> declined to share the financial terms of the deal or details regarding fuel cell system volume. Nikola will assemble the hydrogen fuel cell power modules at its facility in Coolidge, Arizona. Bosch will also supply fully assembled power modules, the company said in a statement Thursday. To support power module assembly, Nikola said it will expand the Arizona facility by 50,000 square feet and up to 50 new employees by 2023. The truck maker is also planning to expand its engineering and testing facilities at its headquarters in nearby Phoenix.</p>
<p>A Nikola spokesperson said the new agreement does not affect the company’s relationships with other companies for fuel cell systems and components, including a non-binding MOU with General Motors for the automaker’s Hydrotec fuel cell system that was announced in November last year.</p>
<p>Nikola went public via a merger with blank-check firm VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. At the beginning of this month, the company told investors that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/nikola-cuts-delivery-outlook-for-its-electric-semi-trucks/">cutting its delivery outlook</a> for electric semis from 50 to 100 units to just 25 to 50. However, company executives did say that it had built 14 pre-production vehicles, including five alpha and nine beta prototypes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nikola’s former CEO and founder, Trevor Milton, promised a criminal court that he would reside at his Utah ranch until he can be tried for securities fraud and misleading investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cohort analysis is a way of evaluating your business that involves grouping customers into &#8220;cohorts&#8221; and observing how they behave over time. A commonly used approach is monthly cohort analysis, where customers are grouped by the month they signed up, allowing you to observe how someone who joined in November compares to someone who signed up the month before.</p>
<p>Cohort analysis gives you a multivariable, forward-looking view of your business compared to more simple and static values like averages or totals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			Cohort analysis is flexible and can be used to analyze a variety of performance metrics including revenue, acquisition costs and churn.					</blockquote>

<p>Let’s imagine you’re the CMO of the &#8220;Bluetooth Coffee Company.&#8221; You sell a tech-enabled &#8220;coffee composer&#8221; that brews coffee, tracks consumption and orders replacement coffee when users are running low. The longer your customers are subscribers, the more money you make. You recently ran a Black Friday feature on a popular deals site and you’re interested to know if you should run it again.</p>
<p>The chart below is a simple analysis you might do to gauge your marketing performance. It shows the total customers added each month, and a clear spike in November following the Black Friday promotion. At first glance, things look good — you brought in more than double the monthly customers in November compared to October.</p>

<p>But before you rebook the promotion, you should ask if these new Black Friday consumers are as valuable as they seem. Comparing monthly customer percentage is a good way to find out.</p>
<p>Below is a monthly cohort analysis of new customers between September 2020 and February 2021. Like our previous chart, we’ve listed the monthly cohort size, but we’ve also included the customer engagement rate (calculated by dividing daily active users by monthly active users or DAU/MAU for each month (M1 is month 1, M2 is month 2, and so on).</p>

<p>From the figures above, we see that most cohorts have a customer engagement rate in their first month (M1, 42%-46%), meaning 42%-46% of new customers use the coffee composer everyday. The November cohort however has materially lower engagement (M1, 30%), and remains lower in subsequent months (M2, 26%) and (M3, 27%). Interestingly, the customer engagement rate only drops with the November cohort, returning to normal with the December cohort (M1, 45%).<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers -- and wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://withshepherd.com/">Shepherd</a>, an insurtech startup focused on the construction market, has closed a $6.15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>. The funding event comes after the startup raised a pre-seed round in February led by <a href="https://www.susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a>, which also participated in Shepherd&#8217;s latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>Thinking broadly, Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers. Insurtech startups serving consumers enjoyed years of venture capital backing only to find their public debuts met with early optimism followed quickly by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">eroding share prices</a>.</p>
<p>But companies like Shepherd &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/">Blueprint Title earlier this week</a> &#8212; are wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. For Shepherd, the construction market is its target, an industry that it intends to carve into starting with excess liability coverage.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Justin Levine, told TechCrunch that contractors in the construction space have a number of insurance requirements, including general liability, commercial auto and so forth. But construction projects often also require more liability coverage, which is sold as excess or umbrella policies.</p>
<p>Targeting the middle-market of the construction space &#8212; companies doing $25 million to $250 million in projects per year, in its view &#8212; Shepherd wants to lean on technology as a way to help underwrite customers.</p>
<p>Levine said that his company&#8217;s offering will have two core parts. The first is what you expected, namely a complete digital experience for customers. The CEO likened its digital offering to table stakes for the insurtech world. We agree. But the company gets more interesting when we consider its second half, namely its work to partner with construction tech providers to help it make underwriting decisions.</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with Procore, for example, a company that invested in its business.</p>
<p>The concept of leaning on third-party software companies to help make underwriting decisions makes some sense &#8212; companies that are more technology-forward in terms of adopting new techniques and methods won&#8217;t have the same underwriting profile as companies that don&#8217;t. Generally, more data makes for better underwriting decisions; linking to the software that helps construction companies function makes good sense from that perspective.</p>
<p>The CEO of Procore agrees, telling TechCrunch that an early customer of his business said that its product is &#8220;a risk management solution disguised as construction management software.&#8221; The more risk that is managed, the lower Shepherd&#8217;s loss ratios may prove over time, allowing it to better compete on price.</p>
<p>On the subject of price, Levine thinks that the construction insurance market is suffering at the moment. Rising settlement costs have led to some legacy insurance books in the space with larger-than-anticipated losses, pushing some providers to raise prices. Levine&#8217;s view is that that Shepherd&#8217;s ability to enter its market without a legacy book of business will help it offer competitive rates.</p>
<p>Excess liability coverage is the &#8220;wedge&#8221; that Shepherd intends to use to get into the construction insurance market, it said, with intention of launching other products in time. The startup is attacking excess liability coverage first, its CEO said, because it&#8217;s the place of maximum pain in the larger construction insurance market.</p>
<p>Frankly, TechCrunch finds the B2B neoinsurance startup market fascinating. Selling policies to consumers has a particular set of cost of goods sold (COGS) &#8212; varying based on the type of coverage, of course &#8212; and often stark go-to-market costs. Furthermore, customer acquisition costs (CACs) can prove irksome when going up against national brands with huge budgets. Perhaps the business insurance market will prove more lucrative for upstart tech companies. Venture investors are certainly willing to place that particular wager.</p>
<p>Natalie Sandman led the deal for Spark, telling TechCrunch that when she first encountered Shepherd it was working on a different project, but that when it shifted its focus, it struck a chord with her firm. The investor said that the idea of bringing new data to the construction insurance underwriting process may help the company make smarter decisions. In the insurance world, better underwriting choices mean more profitable coverage. Which means greater future cash flows. And we all know that that means for value creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> has warned that the Chinese government is using both in-person and digital techniques to intimidate, silence and harass U.S.-based Uyghur Muslims.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Chinese government has long been accused of human rights abuses over its treatment of the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in China&#8217;s Xinjiang region. More than a million Uyghurs have been detained in internment camps, according to a United Nations human rights committee, and many other Uyghurs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">have been targeted and hacked</a> by state-backed cyberattacks. China has repeatedly denied the claims.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese government has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to shut down foreign critics, including those based in the United States and other Western democracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These efforts have now caught the attention of the FBI.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21053780-unclassified-fbi-bulletin-on-prcuyghurs">an unclassified bulletin</a>, the FBI warned that officials are using transnational repression — a term that refers to foreign government transgression of national borders through physical and digital means to intimidate or silence members of diaspora and exile communities — in an attempt to compel compliance from U.S.-based Uyghurs and other Chinese refugees and dissidents, including Tibetans, Falun Gong members, and Taiwan and Hong Kong activists.</p>
<p>“Threatened consequences for non-compliance routinely include detainment of a U.S.-based person’s family or friends in China, seizure of China-based assets, sustained digital and in-person harassment, Chinese government attempts to force repatriation, computer hacking and digital attacks, and false representation online,” the FBI bulletin warns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The bulletin was reported by <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/fbi-uyghurs">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI highlighted four instances of U.S.-based individuals facing harassment. In one case from June, the Chinese government imprisoned dozens of family members of six U.S.-based Uyghur journalists in retaliation for their continued reporting on China and its repression of Uyghurs for the U.S. government-funded news service Radio Free Asia. The bulletin said that between 2019 and March 2021, Chinese officials used WeChat to call and text a U.S.-based Uyghur to discourage her from publicly discussing Uyghur mistreatment. Members of this person’s family were later detained in Xinjiang detention camps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Chinese government continues to conduct this activity, even as the U.S. government has sanctioned Chinese officials and increased public and diplomatic messaging to counter China’s human rights and democratic abuses in Xinjiang over the past year,” the FBI states. “This transnational repression activity violates US laws and individual rights.</p>
<p>The FBI has urged U.S. law enforcement personnel, as well as members of the public, to report any suspected incidents of Chinese government harassment.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Locast argued that it was acting as a booster for local signals, which third parties are allowed to do under US copyright law, to help people who can&#8217;t pick up a signal with an antenna to watch local TV. However, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox (which were reportedly backed by AT&amp;T and Dish Network) felt that Locast was </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-cbs-abc-nbc-fox-sue-locast-copyright-infringement.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">dodging carriage fees</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.botify.com">Botify</a> has raised a $55 million Series C funding round led by InfraVia Growth with Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund also participating. The company has created a search engine optimization (SEO) platform so that your content is better indexed and appears more often in search results.</p>
<p>Existing investors Eurazeo and Ventech are also investing in the startup once again. Nicolas Herschtel from InfraVia and Antoine Izsak from Bpifrance will join the board of directors. Valuation has tripled since the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/botify-series-b/">previous funding round</a>.</p>
<p>While there are a ton of good and bad practices in the SEO industry, Botify defines itself as “white-hat company”. They respect the terms of services of search engines, they don’t scrape search results for insights, they don’t create shady backlinks on other websites.</p>
<p>“We’re going to optimize every step of the search funnel from first the quality of the website, how it is designed, how is the content going to be enriched with, etc.” co-founder and CEO Adrien Menard told me.</p>
<p>There are now three different components in the Botify product suite. The startup first released an analytics tool that gives you insights about your website. Basically, it lets you see how a crawler analyzes your site.</p>
<p>The company then released Botify Intelligence, which hands you a prioritized todo list of things you can do to improve your SEO strategy. And now, the company is also working on automation with Botify Activation. When Google’s search engine bot queries your site, Botify can take over and answer requests directly.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to trick Google’s algorithm. We’re defining Botify as the interface between search engines and our clients’ websites. Search engines are going to access higher quality content. And it’s probably cheaper than with a normal process,” Menard said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies aren’t necessarily using all three tools. They may start with analytics and take it from there. “You can use different products depending on the size of the company,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google has increased the number of ad slots on search results. It also promotes its own services, such as YouTube and Google Maps, before you can see the organic search results. I asked Adrien Menard whether that could be a concern for the future of Botify.</p>
<p>“I agree with you that we’re seeing more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” he said. “But the traffic generated by organic results is growing. It represents 30% of the traffic of the websites of our customers and this average is not decreasing.”</p>
<p>According to him, search keeps getting bigger and bigger. When you invest in search, you can see a clear return on investment when it comes to online sales, traffic, etc.</p>
<p>Right now, Botify has 500 customers, such as Expedia, L’Oréal, The New York Times, Groupon, Marriott, Condé Nast, Crate &amp; Barrel, Fnac Darty, Vestiaire Collective and Farfetch.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to improve its automation capabilities, sign partnerships with more tech companies and increase its footprint with new offices in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, Jeeves was participating in Y Combinator’s summer batch as a fledgling fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, the startup emerged from stealth with $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company, which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global startups, is announcing that it has raised a $57 million Series B at a $500 million valuation. That’s up from a valuation of just north of $100 million at the time of Jeeves’ Series A, which closed in May and was announced in early June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of funding these days is unlike most of us have ever seen before, it’s pretty remarkable that Jeeves essentially signed the term sheet for its Series B just two months after closing on its Series A. It’s also notable that just one year ago, it was wrapping up a YC cohort.</span></p>
<p>Jeeves was not necessarily looking to raise so soon, but fueled by its growth in revenue and spend after its Series A, which was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the company was approached by dozens of potential investors and offered multiple term sheets, according to CEO and co-founder Dileep Thazhmon. Jeeves moved forward with CRV, which had been interested since the A and built a relationship with Thazhmon, so it could further accelerate growth and launch in more countries, he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV led the Series B round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent, Silicon Valley Bank, Alkeon Capital Management, Soros Fund Management and a high-profile group of angel investors including NBA stars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, Odell Beckham Jr. and The Chainsmokers&#8217; Mantis Venture Capital. Notably, the founders of a dozen unicorn companies also put money in the Series B including (but not limited to) Clip CEO Adolfo Babatz; QuintoAndar CEO Gabriel Braga; Uala CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince; Mercury CEO Immad Akhund; Bitso founder Pablo Gonzalez; Monzo Bank’s Tom Blomfield; Intercom founder Des Traynor; Lithic CEO Bo Jiang as well as founders from UiPath, Auth0, GoCardless, Nubank, Rappi, Kavak and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeeves emerges from stealth with $131M in debt and equity and a16z as a lead investor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/embed/#?secret=wiS3qDmIIK" data-secret="wiS3qDmIIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering was live in Mexico and Canada and today launched in Colombia, the United Kingdom and Europe as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country — a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proprietary Banking-as-a-Service infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card (with 4% cash back), non card payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a growing business can use a Jeeves card in Barcelona and pay it back in euros and use the same card in Mexico and pay it back in pesos, reducing any FX fees and providing instant spend reconciliation across currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon believes that the “biggest thing” the company is building out is its own global BaaS layer, that sits across different banking entities in each country, and onto which the end user customer-facing Jeeves app plugs into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, he said, “think of it as a BaaS platform, but with only one app &#8212; the Jeeves app &#8212; plugged into it.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197614" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197614" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2197614 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jeeves</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by more than 5,000% since January, and both revenue and spend volume has increased more than 1,100% (11x) since its Series A earlier this year, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves now covers more than 12 currencies and 10 countries across three continents. Mexico is its largest market. Jeeves is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile and Thazhmon expects that by year’s end, it will be live in all of North America and Europe. Next year, it’s eyeing the Asian market, and Tencent should be able to help with that strategically, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets — cash, corporate cards, cross-border — all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our model is very similar to that of Uber’s launch model where we can launch very quickly because we don&#8217;t have to rebuild an entire infrastructure. When we launch in countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we actually don&#8217;t have to rebuild a stack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves’ user base has been doubling every 60 days and now powers more than 1,000 companies across LatAm, Canada and Europe, including Bitso, Kavak, RappiPay, Belvo, Runa, Moons, Convictional, Muncher, Juniper, Trienta, Platzi, Worky and others, according to Thazhmon. The company says it has a current waitlist of over 15,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves plans to use its new capital toward its launch in Colombia, the U.K. and Europe. And, of course, toward more hiring. It’s already doubled its number of employees to 55 over the past month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former a16z partner Matt Hafemeister was so impressed with what Jeeves is building that in August he left the venture capital firm to join the startup as its head of growth. In working with the founders as an investor, he concluded that they ranked “among the best founders in fintech” he’d ever interacted with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to leave a16z also related to Jeeves’ inflection point, Hafemeister said. The startup is nearly doubling every month, and had already eclipsed year-end goals on revenue by mid-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident Jeeves has found early product market fit and, given the speed of execution, I see Jeeves establishing itself as one of the most important fintech companies in the next few years,” H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">afemeister</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The company is transitioning from a seed company to a Series B company very quickly, and being able to help operationalize processes and play a role in their growth and maturity is an incredible opportunity for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV General Partner Saar Gur (who is also an early investor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in DoorDash, Patreon and Mercury) said he was blown away by Jeeves’ growth and how it has been “consistently hitting and exceeding targets month over month.” Plus, early feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, Gur said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jeeves is building products and infrastructure that are very difficult to execute but by doing the ‘hard things’ they offer incredible value to their customers,” he told TechCrunch. “We haven&#8217;t seen anyone build from the ground up with global operations in mind on day one.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As one of the frontrunners in the race to build the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/">metaverse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/roblox/">Roblox</a> is thinking ahead to what virtual worlds really need. And while the platform has had no shortage of growth on its current path — as of July, it boasted 47 million daily active users — it’s looking to chart a course toward deeper, richer virtual experiences that will keep people coming back for years to come.</p>
<p>To that end, Roblox is taking <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/">careful but decisive steps</a> toward weaving voice chat into the platform’s core experience. The first move: inviting a group of trusted developers to explore how they can integrate proximity-based audio into the wildly popular experiences that beat at the heart of the platform — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tloFO_brF5Y">chill, vaporwavey vibe games</a> to pulling off kickflips in a <a href="https://www.roblox.com/vans">Vans-sponsored skate park</a>.</p>
<p>With spatial audio, users will be able to speak with other people nearby through live voice chat. Roblox sees its new voice product as a natural extension of the way that text chat works now, but instead of text bubbles that pop up over an avatar’s head, visible to anybody around them, players will be able to talk naturally to the other people they bump into.</p>
<p>Say you’re hanging out in a virtual skatepark in Roblox with spatial audio enabled: skaters in the half pipe with you would sound loud and clear, just like they would in real life. But you wouldn’t be able to hear someone walking around on the sidewalk across the street, since they’re too far away. To have a private conversation with a nearby friend, you might peel off and walk toward a store down the block.</p>
<p>“As we think about the future of communication in the metaverse, we think that it needs to be very natural and feel very similar to the way we communicate in the real world,” Roblox Chief Product Officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch in an interview. “But it also can transcend, some of the limitations that physics and space create in the real world.”</p>
<p>Bronstein joined the company in March, leaving Google to help realize Roblox’s particular vision for the metaverse. Prior to hopping over to Roblox, Bronstein worked on product teams at Zynga, Xbox and YouTube — three very different companies that are probably equal parts relevant to his current work.</p>
<p>“If you think about the the metaverse as the next incarnation of where you know I could go shopping or I could go to a concert, I could go to school, I think that you need to be relevant to everybody in society and you need to both build the content, the rules, the features that support all of those behaviors,&#8221; Bronstein said. &#8220;And part of bringing voice to the platform is to ensure that our older audiences has a natural way to communicate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voice chat is very much on the way to Roblox, but that doesn’t mean it will appear overnight — and that’s by design. The company is inviting an initial group of 5,000 developers, all 13 and older, to try out the new spatial voice chat capabilities in a custom-built Roblox community space.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve put a bunch of neat features in there and places for them to chat and hang out and they’re going to be able to learn from the code that we wrote for that community space… So a few weeks later or a month later they can put that into their experiences and turn it on,” Bronstein said.</p>
<p>Bronstein emphasizes that Roblox will take this process slowly, building new moderation and safety tools in parallel as it goes. The voice rollout will go slowly, starting with the chosen circle of developers and gradually expanding out from there as the company feels confident that it can create a safe enough environment with its moderation tools.</p>
<p>“I think we want to take it slowly and we want to learn as we go through it,” Bronstein said. “We may start, as I mentioned, with the developers. It is likely that right after that, we may go to an audience that is 13+ and park there for a while until we understand exactly if all the pieces are falling into place before deciding if we ever open it to a younger audience.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7DTnDje3Fy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/">The Roblox final fantasy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Roblox final fantasy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/embed/#?secret=7DTnDje3Fy" data-secret="7DTnDje3Fy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To moderate its sprawl of virtual worlds, Roblox uses a blend of automated scanning and a 3,000-person safety team of human reviewers. Like in any social network, players can report, block and mute other players to make their own experiences feel more comfortable. And because half of its player base is under 13, Roblox gives parents options on what kinds of age-appropriate experiences to allow and toggles for things like text chat. If voice chat ever makes its way to younger age groups, parents would be able to disable it altogether.</p>
<p>Roblox’s under-13 crowd comprises a massive chunk of its user base, but a surprising number of older kids and young adults hang out there too. According to the company, 50 percent of its users are over the age of 13 and it’s seeing the most explosive user growth among 17 to 24-year-olds. Roblox is attracting new users, but its core users are also growing up and the company knows it needs to grow alongside them.</p>
<p>Whether voice chat ever rolls out for younger users or not, Roblox seems well aware that keeping a virtual environment with voice chat feeling safe and friendly is a steep challenge. The company plans to rely on user-initiated reporting as voice rolls out and it’s exploring other tools that could bolster those efforts. The company is looking at a few different tools, including automatically recording a snippet of conversation just prior to a user being reported as a way to capture bad behavior for reviewers. It&#8217;s also interested in expanding reputation systems that automatically restrict users who have a certain number of strikes against them.</p>
<p>Much like any social platform, Roblox will likely lean heavily on user reporting, which disproportionately shifts the burden to users on the receiving end of hate and harassment — an unfortunate outcome that no social company has properly dedicated the human resources to solving.</p>

<h3>Next on the voice roadmap</h3>
<p>Bronstein describes spatial audio as “one component” of Roblox’s vision for natural communication. The next step is integrating a voice chat experience that’s persistent across experiences, letting users who know each other hang out even when they aren’t doing the same thing. For anyone who paid attention to the company’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"> quiet acquisition of a company called Guilded</a> last month, that won’t come as a surprise. Though Roblox’s work on voice pre-dates the acquisition, Guilded will lay the groundwork for Roblox’s future voice plans</p>
<p>A Discord competitor, Guilded similarly built out a chat platform for gamers, doubling down on the competitive gaming scene where Discord expanded its horizons beyond gaming. Beyond group voice chat, Guilded gives gamers built-in scheduling and community management tools that ease the hassle of organizing complex online social events, like wrangling twenty some odd gamers to run raids in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>“In the near term, Guilded has an amazing road map, we want to just continue with that road map and grow it without any hardcore integration at this point,” Bronstein said.</p>

<h3>Into the metaverse</h3>
<p>Moderation challenges aside, there&#8217;s basically nothing in Roblox&#8217;s way. The company went public in March and today it&#8217;s worth 49 billion, making it easily one of the most valuable companies in gaming. Investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">content creators</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/"> tech giants</a> alike are going all-in on the metaverse, and really, it looks like a pretty safe bet.</p>
<p>Metaverse is a buzzy term right now, but it&#8217;s more shorthand than empty hype. When people talk about the metaverse, they generally want to evoke a futuristic vision of interconnected virtual worlds — online spaces that we can move through, socialize and shop within (for better or worse, that last part is key). Whether this will all be in virtual reality or not and when is a point of some debate, but really the <em>interconnected</em> part is the bigger challenge. In the app age, software was siloed by design. But to realize the promise of the metaverse, our virtual selves and our virtual stuff will need to be able to move through online worlds fluidly.</p>
<p>A few companies are ahead of the curve on this, and it&#8217;s no coincidence that two of the big ones, Roblox and Fortnite-maker Epic — best known for their virtual worlds stocked with custom avatars, in-game economies and a seamless social layer — are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">elevating user-created content</a>. Those experiences, and the ability to easily hang out with friends while doing stuff in them and elsewhere in virtual space, may wind up being what the metaverse is all about.</p>
<p>Most adults can hardly grasp the appeal of the blocky, suburban worlds that their kids love hanging out in, but Roblox understands something fundamental about where online life is <em>going</em>. Or rather where we&#8217;ll all going — into online worlds like Roblox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after celebrating its first manned launch to orbit – which is now under investigation with the Federal Aviation Administration – Virgin Galactic wants to return to space.</p>
<p>The company will be conducting its first commercial mission, the 23<sup>rd</sup> for the VSS Unity rocket-powered spaceplane, in late September or early October from the company’s sprawling Spaceport America facility. The flight will carry three crew members from the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council, each of whom paid an undisclosed amount for the seat. A Virgin Galactic staff member will also be on board.</p>
<p>The role of mission lead will be held by Walter Villadei, a Colonel with the Italian Air Force; Angelo Landolfi, a physician and Lieutenant Colonel; Pantaleone Carlucci, an aerospace engineer on behalf of the National Research Council; and Virgin Galactic’s chief astronaut instructor Beth Moses. Michael Masucci and CJ Sturckow will pilot the spaceplane.</p>
<p>The goal of the mission will be to evaluate the effects of the “transitional phase” from gravity to zero G on the human body; to that end, the crew members will be wearing sensors to measure physiological activity, and Villadei will even be wearing a smart suit that Virgin says will “[incorporate] Italian fashion style and technology.”</p>
<p>The announcement comes just one day after the FAA said that it was investigating the first crewed flight of VSS Unity in July. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a> and confirmed by the aerospace regulatory, who said that the spaceplane “deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.” According to journalist Nicholas Schmidle’s reporting, a red warning light appeared on the dash of the Unity during flight, indicating that it had diverged from its planned trajectory.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FAA opens probe into anomaly on Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Galactic spaceflight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-opens-probe-into-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-virgin-galactic-spaceflight/embed/#?secret=DJs5ZqcDQD" data-secret="DJs5ZqcDQD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Virgin Galactic later issued a statement disputing the piece, saying that “athough the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory,” the company added.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Schmidle has uncovered news regarding the safety of Virgin Galactic’s supersonic operations. His book, Test Gods, also includes a previously unknown account of a 2019 test flight (confirmed in the book by former employees) which saw potentially serious issues with the plane’s wing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe&#8217;s top court has dealt another blow to &#8216;zero rating&#8217; &#8212; ruling for a second time that the controversial carrier practice goes against the European Union&#8217;s rules on open Internet access.</p>
<p>&#8216;Zero rating&#8217; refers to commercial offers that can be made by mobile network operators to entice customers by excluding the data consumption of certain (often popular) apps from a user&#8217;s tariff.</p>
<p>The practice is controversial because it goes against the &#8216;level playing field&#8217; principle of the open Internet (aka &#8216;net neutrality&#8217;).</p>
<p>EU legislators passed the bloc&#8217;s first set of open Internet/net neutrality rules <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/ep-telecoms-vote/">back in 2015</a> &#8212; with the law coming into application in 2016 &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/here-are-the-meps-you-should-tweet-about-net-neutrality-this-morning/">critics warned</a> at the time over vague provisions in the regulation which they suggested could be used by carriers to undermine the core fairness principle of treating all Internet traffic the same.</p>
<p>Some regional telcos have continued to put out zero rating offers &#8212; which has led to a number of challenges to test the robustness of the law. But the viability of zero rating within the EU must now be in doubt given the double slap-down by the CJEU.</p>
<p>In its first major decision <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/europes-top-court-says-net-neutrality-rules-bar-zero-rating/">last year</a> &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">relating to a challenge against Telenor in Hungary &#8212; the court found that commercial use of zero rating was liable to limit the exercise of end users’ rights within the meaning of the regulation.</span></p>
<p>Its ruling today &#8212; which relates to a challenge against zero rating by Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland in Germany (this time with a roaming component) &#8212; comes to what looks like an even clearer conclusion, with the court giving the practice very short shrift indeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By today’s judgments, the Court of Justice notes that a ‘zero tariff’ option, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, draws a distinction within internet traffic, on the basis of commercial considerations, by not counting towards the basic package traffic to partner applications. Such a commercial practice is contrary to the general obligation of equal treatment of traffic, without discrimination or interference, as required by the regulation on open internet access,&#8221; it writes in a (notably brief) press release summarizing the judgement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since those limitations on bandwidth, tethering or on use when roaming apply only on account of the activation of the ‘zero tariff’ option, which is contrary to the regulation on open internet access, they are also incompatible with EU law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland for comment on the ruling.</p>
<p>In a statement welcoming the CJEU&#8217;s decision, the European consumer protection association BEUC&#8217;s senior digital policy officer, Maryant Fernández Pérez, subbed the ruling &#8220;very positive news for consumers and those who want the internet to stay open to all&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies like Vodafone use these ‘zero tariff’ rates, they essentially lock-in consumers and limit what the Internet can offer to them. Zero-rating is detrimental to consumer choice, competition, innovation, media diversity and freedom of information,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Kathryn Zealand shared some insight on the eve of Women’s Equality Day. The post highlighted an issue that&#8217;s been apparent to everyone in and around the robotics industry: there’s a massive gender gap. It’s something we try to be mindful of, particularly when programming events like TC Sessions: Robotics. Zealand cites some pretty staggering figures in the piece.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zippia.com/robotics-engineer-jobs/demographics/">According to the stats</a>, around 9% of robotics engineers are female. That’s bad. That’s, like, bad even by the standards of STEM fields in general &#8212; which is to say, it’s really, really bad. (The ethnic disparities in the same source are worth drawing attention to, as well.)</p>
<p>Zealand’s piece was published on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/robotics-future-lets-make-sure-its-built-everyone-kathryn-zealand/">LinkedIn</a> &#8212; fitting, given that the overarching focus here is on hiring. Well worth your time, if you&#8217;re involved in the hiring process at a robotics firm and are concerned about broader diversity issues (which hopefully go hand in hand for most orgs). Zealand offers some outside of the box thinking in terms of what, precisely, it means to be a roboticist, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a huge opportunity here! Women and other under-represented groups are untapped pools of talented people who, despite not thinking of themselves as “roboticists,” could be vital members of a world-changing robotics team.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to be real with you for a minute, and note what really caught my eye was that above image. See, Zealand is a Project Lead at Alphabet X. And what you have there is a robotic brace &#8212; or, rather, what appears to be a component of a soft exosuit.</p>

<p>Exosuits/exoskeletons are a booming category for robotics right now that really run the gamut from Sarcos’ giant James Cameron-esque suit to far subtler, fabric-based systems. Some key names in the space include Ekso Bionics, ReWalk and SuitX. Heck, even Samsung has shown off a solution as part of a robotics department that appears to be largely ornamental at the moment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197565" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197565" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197565 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="312" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Harvard Biodesign Lab</p></div></p>
<p>Most of these systems aim to tackle one of two issues: 1) Augmenting workers to assist with difficult or repetitive tasks for work and 2) Provide assistance to those with impaired mobility. Many companies have offers for both. Here’s what Harvard’s <a href="https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/soft-exosuits">Biodesign Lab</a> has to say on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer&#8217;s joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light. These properties minimize the suit&#8217;s unintentional interference with the body&#8217;s natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alphabet loves to give the occasional behind-the-scenes peak at some of its X projects, and it turns out we’ve had a couple of glimpses of the Smarty Pants project. Zealand and Smarty Pants make a cameo in a Wired UK piece that ran early last year about the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Google/Alphabet X. The piece notes that that the project was inspired by her experience with her 92-year-old grandmother’s mobility issues.</p>

<p>The piece highlights a very early Raspberry Pi-controlled setup created by a team that includes costume designers and deep learning specialists (getting back to that earlier discussion about outside the box thinking when it comes to what constitutes a roboticist). The system is using sensors in an attempt to effectively predict movement in order to anticipate where force needs to be applied for tasks like walking up stairs. The piece ends on a fittingly somber note, “Fewer than half of X’s investigations become Projects. By the time this story is published it will probably have been killed.”</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the team is looking to differentiate itself from other exosuit projects by leveraging Google&#8217;s knowledge base of deep learning and AI to build out those predictive algorithms.</p>
<p>Alphabet declined to offer additional information on the project, noting that it likes to give its moonshot teams, &#8220;time to learn and iterate out of the spotlight.” But last October, we got what is probably our best look at Smarty Pants, in the form of a video highlighting Design Kitchen, Alphabet X’s lab/design studio.</p>

<p>The Wired piece mentions a “pearlescent bumbag,” holding the aforementioned Raspberry Pi and additional components. For you yanks, that’s a fanny pack, which are not referred to as such in the U.K., owing to certain regional slang. Said fanny pack also makes an appearance in the video, providing, honestly, a very clever solution to the issue of hanging wires for an early-stage wearable prototype.</p>
<p>“One of the things that’s really helped the team is being really focused on a problem. Even if you spent months on something, if it’s not actually going to achieve that goal, then sometimes you honor the work that’s been done and say, ‘we’ve learned a ton of things during the process, but this is not the one that’s actually going to solve that problem.’ ”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbDQtxPxg08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The most notable takeaway from the video is some additional footage of prototypes. One imagines that, by the time Alphabet feels confident sharing that sort of stuff with the world, the team has moved well beyond it. “It doesn’t matter how janky and cardboard-and-duct-tape it is, as long as it helps you learn — and everyone can prototype, even while working from home,” the X team writes in an associated blog post.</p>
<p>The one other bit of information we have at the moment is<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d6/7d/48/38c3bcd8a1a8d7/US20210084997A1.pdf"> a granted patent application from last year</a>, which comes with all of the standard patent warnings. Seeing a patent come to fruition is often even more of a longshot (read: moonshot) than betting on an Alphabet X project to graduate. But they can offer some insight into where a team is headed &#8212; or at least some of the avenues it has considered.</p>

<p>The patent highlights similar attempts to anticipate movement as those highlighted above. It effectively uses sensors and machine learning to adjust the tension on regions of the garments designed to assist the wearer.</p>

<p>The proposed methods and systems provide adaptive support and assistance to users by performing intelligent dynamic adjustment of tension and stiffness in specific areas of fabric or by applying forces to non-stretch elements within a garment that is comfortable enough to be suitable for frequent, everyday usage. The methods include detecting movement of a particular part of a user&#8217;s body enclosed within the garment, determining an activity classification for that movement, identifying a support configuration for the garment tailored to the activity classification, and dynamically adjusting a tension and/or a stiffness of one or more controllable regions of the garment or applying force to non-stretch fabric elements in the garment to provide customized support and assistance for the user and the activity the user is performing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice seeing Alphabet take a more organic approach to developing robotics startups in-house, rather than the acquisitions and consolidations that occurred several years back that ultimately found Boston Dynamics briefly living under the Google umbrella. Of course, we saw the recent graduation of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/">Wendy Tan White-led Intrinsic</a>, which builds software for industrial robotics.</p>
<p>All right, so there’s a whole bunch of words about a project we know next to nothing about! Gotta love the startup space, where we’re definitely not spinning wild speculation based on a thin trail of breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>I will say for sure that I definitely know more about Agility Robotics than I did this time last week, after speaking with the Oregon-based company’s CEO and CTO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/agility-robotics-digit-gets-a-warehouse-gig/">The conversation</a> was ostensibly about a new video the team released showcasing Digit doing some menial tasks in a warehouse/fulfillment setting.</p>
<p>Some key things I learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agility sold a dozen Cassie robots, largely to researchers.</li>
<li>It’s already sold “substantially more” Digits.</li>
<li>The team includes 56 people, primarily in Oregon (makes sense, as an OSU spinout), with plans to expand operations into Pittsburgh, everyone’s favorite rustbelt robotics hub.</li>
<li>Agility is consulting with “major logistics companies.”</li>
<li>In addition to the Ford delivery deal, the company has its sights set on warehouse tasks in hopes of offering a more adaptable solution than ground-up warehouse automation companies like Berkshire Gray.</li>
</ol>
<p><div id="attachment_2197116" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197116" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_51_18-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Oh, and a good quote about job loss from CEO Damion Shelton:</p>
<blockquote><p>The conversation around automation has shifted a bit. It’s viewed as an enabling technology to allow you to keep the workforce that you have. There are a lot of conversations around the risks of automation and job loss, but the job loss is actually occurring now, in advance of the automated solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agility hopes to start rolling out its robots to locations in the next year. More immediate than that, however, is this deal between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/simbes-robots-will-be-deployed-across-midwestern-grocery-chain-schnucks/">Simbe Robotics and midwestern grocery chain, Schnuks</a>. The food giant will be bringing Simbe’s inventor robots to all of its 111 stores, four years after it began piloting the tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/carbon-robotics-secures-27m/">Carbon Robotics</a> (not to be confused with the prosthetic company of the same name that made it onto our Hardware Battlefield a few years back) just raised $27 million. The Series B brings its total funding to around $36 million. The Seattle-based firm builds autonomous robots that zap weeds with lasers.

<p>Segway&#8217;s first robotic lawnmower is designed for a lawn area of up to 3,000 square meters, has several features of a smart helper in the garden and is the quietest mower on the market with only 54 dB. The Frequent Soft Cut System (FSCS) ensures that the lawn is cut from above and the desired height is reached gradually. Offset blades allow cutting as close as possible to edges and corners.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to hand over detailed Autopilot data by October 22nd or else face fines of up to $115 million, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Back in August, NHTSA announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">investigating</a> incidents wherein Tesla vehicles with Autopilot activated crashed into parked first responder vehicles with flashing lights. The agency originally cited 11 such crashes, which resulted in 17 injuries and one death since 2018, but a 12th incident occurred just this Saturday.</p>
<p>In a letter it sent the automaker, the NHTSA told Tesla to produce detailed information on how the driver assistance system works. It wants to know how it ensures that human drivers will keep their eyes on the road while Autopilot is engaged and whether there are limits on where it can be used. Feds have long criticized Tesla for not having the safeguards to make sure human drivers are keeping their hands on the wheel. A few months ago, the company finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-in-car-camera-autopilot-081511875.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">activated</a> the camera mounted above the rear view mirror in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to &#8220;detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged.&#8221; In addition, Autopilot is only meant for use on highways, but there&#8217;s nothing keeping drivers from using it on local roads.</p>
<p>In addition to detailed Autopilot data, the NHTSA is also asking for information on how many cars Tesla has sold in the US. It wants to know every Autopilot-related arbitration proceeding or lawsuit the company has been involved in, along with all the complaints Tesla has received about the driver assistance technology from customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.panoramaed.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built out a K-12 education software platform, has raised $60 million in a Series C round of funding led by General Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Owl Ventures, Emerson Collective, Uncork Capital, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Tao Capital Partners also participated in the financing, which brings the Boston-based company’s total raised since its 2012 inception to $105 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama declined to reveal at what valuation the Series C was raised, nor did it provide any specific financial growth metrics. CEO and co-founder Aaron Feuer did say the company now serves 13 million students in 23,000 schools across the United States, which means that 25% of American students are enrolled in a district served by Panorama today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 of the largest 100 school districts and state agencies in the country use its platform. In total, more than 1,500 school districts are among its customers. Clients include the New York City Department of Education, Clark County School District in Nevada, Dallas ISD in Texas and the Hawaii Department of Education, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since March 2020, Panorama has added 700 school districts to its customer base, nearly doubling the 800 it served just 18 months prior, according to Feuer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what does Panorama do exactly? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the SaaS business surveys students, parents and teachers to collect actionable data. Former Yale graduate students Feuer and Xan Tanner started the company in an effort to figure out the best way for schools to collect and understand feedback from their students.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Panorama Raises $12 Million To Help Schools Understand Their Students&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/panorama-raises-12-million-to-help-schools-understand-their-students/embed/#?secret=zk1a4GvtEq" data-secret="zk1a4GvtEq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to many students attending school virtually, the need to address students’ social and emotional needs has probably never been more paramount. Many children and teenagers have suffered depression and anxiety due to being isolated from their peers, and some believe the impact on their mental health has been even greater than any negative academic repercussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, for example, are asked questions to determine how safe they feel at school, how much they trust their teachers and how much potential they think they have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help schools survey students, teachers and parents to understand the environment and experiences of the school,” Feuer told TechCrunch. “And then we help schools measure social and emotional development so that in the same way you might have rigorous data on math, you can now get information about social emotional learning and well-being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, for example, 25 million people across the country have taken a Panorama survey, which has resulted in quite a bit of information. The company is able to integrate with all of a district’s existing data systems so that it can pull together a “panorama” of its data, plus the information about a student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really powerful because a teacher can then log in and see everything about a student in one place,” Feuer said. “But most importantly, we give teachers the tools to plan actions for a student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, districts can see benefits such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved graduation rates, fewer behavior referrals, more time engaged in learning and students building “stronger supportive relationships with adults and peers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama plans to use its new capital toward continued product development, further deepening its district partnerships and naturally, toward hiring. Panorama currently has about 250 employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Panorama had not raised capital in a couple of years simply because, according to Feuer, it did not need the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We met General Atlantic and realized the opportunity to reach the next level of impact for our schools,” he told TechCrunch. “But it was important to me that we didn’t need to raise the money. We chose to because we want to be able to invest in the business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanzeen Syed, managing director at General Atlantic, said edtech has been an important area of focus for this firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looked at the U.S. education system, we thought that there was a massive opportunity and that we&#8217;re in the very early innings of using software and technology to really enhance the student experience,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to Panorama, he believes “it’s not just a business” for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They truly and deeply care about providing students and administrators with the tools to make the student experience better,” Syed told TechCrunch. “And they&#8217;re maniacally focused on developing the sort of product to allow them to do that. In addition to that, we spoke with a lot of schools and districts and the feedback came back consistently positive.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the past 18 months is any indication, the nature of the workplace is changing. And while Box and Zoom already have integrations together, it makes sense for them to continue to work more closely.</p>
<p>Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.</p>
<p>While in Zoom, users can securely and directly access Box to browse, preview and share files from Zoom — even if they are not taking part in an active meeting. This new feature follows a Zoom integration Box launched last year with its “Recommended Apps” section that enables access to Zoom from Box so that workflows aren’t disrupted.</p>
<p>The companies’ chief product officers, Diego Dugatkin with Box and Oded Gal with Zoom, discussed with TechCrunch why seamless partnerships like these are a solution for the changing workplace.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/">The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/embed/#?secret=sKjtHwnfzQ" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With digitization happening everywhere, an integration of “best-in-breed” products for collaboration is essential, Dugatkin said. Not only that, people don’t want to be moving from app to app, instead wanting to stay in one environment.</p>
<p>“It’s access to content while never having to leave the Zoom platform,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also access to content and contacts in different situations. When everyone was in an office, meeting at a moment’s notice internally was not a challenge. Now, more people are understanding the value of flexibility, and both Gal and Dugatkin expect that spending some time at home and some time in the office will not change anytime soon.</p>
<p>As a result, across the spectrum of a company, there is an increasing need for allowing and even empowering people to work from anywhere, Dugatkin said. That then leads to a conversation about sharing documents in a secure way for companies, which this collaboration enables.</p>
<p>The new Box and Zoom integration enables meeting in a hybrid workplace: chat, video, audio, computers or mobile devices, and also being able to access content from all of those methods, Gal said.</p>
<p>“Companies need to be dynamic as people make the decision of how they want to work,” he added. “The digital world is providing that flexibility.”</p>
<p>This long-term partnership is just scratching the surface of the continuous improvement the companies have planned, Dugatkin said.</p>
<p>Dugatkin and Gal expect to continue offering seamless integration before, during and after meetings: utilizing Box’s cloud storage, while also offering the ability for offline communication between people so that they can keep the workflow going.</p>
<p>“As Diego said about digitization, we are seeing continuous collaboration enhanced with the communication aspect of meetings day in and day out,” Gal added. “Being able to connect between asynchronous and synchronous with Zoom is addressing the future of work and how it is shaping where we go in the future.”</p>

(The newsletter will go out Saturday as always.) Also, Alex is off next week. Anna is taking on next week’s newsletter and may have a column or two on deck as well.</p>
<p>But before we slow down for a few days, let’s chat about the most recent Y Combinator Demo Day in thematic detail.</p>
<p>If you caught the last few <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity episodes</a>, some of this will be familiar, but we wanted to put a flag in the ground for later reference as we cover startups for the rest of the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>

<p>What follows is a roundup of trends among Y Combinator startups and how they squared with our expectations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A big thanks to the TechCrunch crew who covered the startup deluge live, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristineMHall">Christine</a> for helping build out our notes during our last few Twitter Spaces.

<p>To start, we were surprised by the sheer number of startups in the cohort that were pursuing software models that incorporated no-code and low-code techniques. We expected some, surely, but not the nearly 20 that we compiled this morning.</p>
<p>Startups in the YC batch are building no-code and low-code tools to help developers build faster internal workflows (<a href="https://www.tantl.com/">Tantl</a>), build branded real estate portals (<a href="https://noloco.io">Noloco</a>), sync data between other no-code tools (<a href="https://www.whalesync.com">Whalesync</a>), automate HR (<a href="https://zazos.com/en">Zazos</a>), and more. Also in the mix were <a href="https://hello.brightreps.com/">BrightReps</a>, <a href="https://beau.to">Beau</a>, <a href="https://getalchemy.app/">Alchemy</a>, <a href="https://hyperseed.com">Hyperseed</a>, <a href="https://enso.org">Enso</a>, <a href="https://www.hitpayapp.com/">HitPay</a>, <a href="https://whaly.io/">Whaly</a>, <a href="https://www.muse.place/">Muse</a>, Abstra, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/">Lago</a>, <a href="https://www.inai.io/">Inai</a> and <a href="http://www.breadcrumbs.io/">Breadcrumbs.io</a>.</p>
<p>At least 18 companies in the group name-dropped no- and low-code in their pitches. They are taking on a host of industries, from finance and real estate to sales and HR. In short, no- and low-code tools are cropping up in what feels like every sector. It appears that the startup world has decided that helping non-developers build their own tools, workflows and apps is a trend here to stay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://explosion.ai/">Explosion</a>, a company that has combined an open source machine learning library with a set of commercial developer tools, announced a $6 million Series A today on a $120 million valuation. The round was led by SignalFire, and the company reported that today&#8217;s investment represents 5% of its value.</p>
<p>Oana Olteanu from SignalFire will be joining the board under the terms of the deal, which includes warrants of $12 million in additional investment at the same price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, Explosion is a software company and we build developer tools for AI and machine learning and natural language processing. So our goal is to make developers more productive and more focused on their natural language processing, so basically understanding large volumes of text, and training machine learning models to help with that and automate some processes,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Ines Montani told me.</p>
<p>The company started in 2016 when Montani met her co-founder, Matthew Honnibal in Berlin where he was working on the <a href="http://spaCy.io">spaCy</a> open source machine learning library. Since then, that open source project has been downloaded over 40 million times.</p>
<p>In 2017, they added <a href="https://prodi.gy/">Prodigy</a>, a commercial product for generating data for the machine learning model. &#8220;Machine learning is code plus data, so to really get the most out of the technologies you almost always want to train your models and build custom systems because what&#8217;s really most valuable are problems that are super specific to you and your business and what you&#8217;re trying to find out, and so we saw that the area of creating training data, training these machine learning models, was something that people didn&#8217;t pay very much attention to at all,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The next step is a product called Prodigy Teams, which is a big reason the company is taking on this investment. &#8220;Prodigy Teams is [a hosted service that] adds user management and collaboration features to Prodigy, and you can run it in the cloud without compromising on what people love most about Prodigy, which is the data privacy, so no data ever needs to get seen by our servers,&#8221; she said. They do this by letting the data sit on the customer&#8217;s private cluster in a private cloud, and then use Prodigy Team&#8217;s management features in the public cloud service.</p>
<p>Today, they have 500 companies using Prodigy including Microsoft and Bayer in addition to the huge community of millions of open source users. They&#8217;ve built all this with just six early employees, a number that has grown to 17 recently (they hope to reach 20 by year&#8217;s end).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes if you&#8217;re thinking too much about diversity in your hiring process, you probably have a problem already. &#8220;If you go into hiring and you&#8217;re thinking like, oh, how can I make sure that the way I&#8217;m hiring is diverse, I think that already shows that there&#8217;s maybe a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a company, and it&#8217;s 50 dudes in their 20s, it&#8217;s not surprising that you might have problems attracting people who are not white dudes in their 20s. But in our case, our strategy is to hire good people and good people are often very diverse people, and again if you play by the [startup] playbook, you could be limited in a lot of other ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that they have never seen themselves as a traditional startup following some conventional playbook. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t raise any investment money [until now]. We grew the team organically, and we focused on being profitable and independent [before we got outside investment],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But more than the money, Montani says that they needed to find an investor that would understand and support the open source side of the business, even while they got capital to expand all parts of the company. &#8220;Open source is a community of users, customers and employees. They are real people, and [they are not] pawns in [some] startup game, and it&#8217;s not a game. It&#8217;s real, and these are real people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve more than just my eyeballs and grand promises. [&#8230;] And so it&#8217;s very important that even if we&#8217;re selling a small stake in our company for some capital [to build our next] product [that open source remains at] the core of our company and that&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t want to compromise on,&#8221; Montani said.</p>
