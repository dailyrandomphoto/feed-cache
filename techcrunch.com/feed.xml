					<description><![CDATA[If you run marketing for an early-stage startup, these growth experts have some advice for how you can get the most value out of your meager budget.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What could an early-stage founder do with a $25,000 investment?</p>
<p>Hypothetically, they could use that money to buy 50 Herman Miller Aeron chairs or five top-of-the-line MacBook Pros for the engineering team. Or, they could use the funds to kick-start their 2022 marketing efforts.</p>
<p>A new year is quickly approaching, which brings new resolutions — and new budgets. To get some expert advice about how to optimize next year&#8217;s marketing spending, we reached out to several professionals we identified through our TechCrunch<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"> Experts</a> project and asked: <strong>&#8220;If you only had a $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, how would you spend it?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;People really do come back from the holidays looking for new tools, new experiences, new ways to do things,&#8221; said Tracey Wallace, director of marketing at MarketerHire. She said companies can &#8220;make the most of that&#8221; by doing some industry-related research now that can be adapted after the new year for long-form site content and social media campaigns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Martinez of JM Strategy advised running parallel campaigns on TikTok, Facebook and Google. &#8220;Instead of going full force on only one channel, I’d try to make the decision at about the halfway mark ($12,500) on which channel of the three to double down on,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who we talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camsinclair1/">Cam Sinclair</a>, director/marketeer, <a href="https://www.ammo.marketing/">Ammo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camsinclair1/">Jonathan Metrick,</a> chief growth officer, <a href="https://portagevc.com/">Portage Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/traceyrwallace/">Tracey Wallace</a>, director of marketing, <a href="https://marketerhire.com/">MarketerHire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmartinez-in/">Jonathan Martinez</a>, founder, <a href="http://www.jmstrategy.com/">JMStrategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmoufarek/">Maya Moufarek</a>, founder, <a href="https://marketingcube.co/">Marketing Cube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peeplaja/">Peep Laja</a>, CEO, <a href="https://wynter.com/">Wynter</a> and founder of <a href="https://cxl.com/">CXL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-goldman/">Lindsay Goldman</a>, strategic advisor, <a href="https://themopros.com/">MO Pros</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cam Sinclair, director/marketeer, Ammo</h2>
<p>If we were advising one of our early-stage startups how best to deploy their $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, here’s what we’d suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Budget breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Growth marketing course with Demand Curve: $2,500.</li>
<li>Minimum viable brand design: $5,000.</li>
<li>Events, PR: $5,000.</li>
<li>LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram campaign: $5,000.</li>
<li>Video content: $5,000.</li>
<li>Copywriting: $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand growth</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some great resources and communities out there that help founders understand and apply growth. One we have been loving lately at Ammo is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/demand-curve-how-zapier-acquires-customers-via-its-homepage/">Demand Curve</a>. They have a course, Slack community and templates for startups and can even review your campaigns when you get started. The other course/community I&#8217;d recommend for an introduction to growth is Growth Tribe based in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Build a &#8220;minimum viable brand&#8221; that can scale</strong></p>
<p>Invest in brand and design upfront, but don’t go over the top. (We talked about the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/australian-growth-marketing-agency-ammo-helps-startups-calibrate-their-efforts/"> minimum viable brand concept in a recent TechCrunch story</a>) Your brand touches everything you do in marketing so having a great foundation will put you in good stead and make sure you are looking professional in front of customers.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in a copywriter</strong></p>
<p>Distilling complex ideas into short, succinct copy is a superpower. Investing in a pro copywriter to explain your value proposition is always worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Grow your network with events and PR</strong></p>
<p>You may have been involved in your customer&#8217;s industry for a while before you started the company. Utilize these connections and ask for help. It&#8217;s amazing how many founders don&#8217;t first check with their immediate network when they start. After you take that first step, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/steve-blank-teaches-entrepreneurs-how-to-fail-less/">Steve Blank</a> says you need to &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-J_SwmMJyo">get out of the building</a>&#8221; and start having conversations with customers but also be present in their community. Most of the time there will be events in your industry that you can sponsor or speak at as an expert in the field. If your technology is solving a big problem for the people in the room they should want to know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Run a short LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram campaign on your topic or service</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram still remain amongst the cheapest marketing channels available. Not only does it give you a chance to test your brand message and content in front of live customers, but it can also help you build an audience or email list in the platform of your choice.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is continuing its acquisition strategy, this time with a cash and stock deal with Planetary Systems Corporation (PSC).</p>
<p>The news was announced ahead of the company’s third-quarter earnings. Rocket Lab said it would purchase the company for $42 million in cash, plus 1,720,841 in shares of common stock, with the potential for additional shares based on future performance.</p>
<p>PSC is a spacecraft separation systems company based in Maryland. More than 100 missions have used its mechanical separation systems and satellite dispensers. The company makes a “Canisterized Satellite Dispenser,” a separation system to separate spacecraft from rockets while also protecting them during launch. PSC’s hardware has been integrated with launch vehicles developed domestically by SpaceX, United Launch Alliance and the now-retired NASA Space Shuttle; and internationally by Arianespace, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234384" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The deal comes as Rocket Lab continues to pursue its goal of becoming not simply a launch provider, but a fully vertically integrated space services company, offering everything from transportation to orbit to the spacecraft themselves. Rocket Lab said in a statement that it will use the product hardware across its Space Systems division, which includes its Photon satellite buses and spacecraft component products.</p>
<p>This marks Rocket Lab’s third acquisition in around 18 months. Last month, the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/rocket-lab-acquires-spaceflight-software-and-mission-simulation-company-asi-for-40m/">it had acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc.,</a> a Colorado-based company that develops flight software for spacecraft. Rocket Lab also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/rocket-lab-to-acquire-satellite-hardware-maker-sinclair-interplanetary/">acquired Sinclair Interplanetary last year</a>, a manufacturer of space hardware.</p>
<p>PSC will continue to be headed by the current CEO, Mike Whalen. The deal is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mark Cuban’s Fireside, an interactive platform that is helping creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/mark-cuban-backed-live-entertainment-app-fireside-launches-to-creators/">share their stories with audiences through live and virtual shows</a>, is in advanced stages to close a “seed+” round, two sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The financing round has already received commitment from investors such as The Chainsmokers, HBSE, Goodwater, Animal Capital and NFL stars Larry Fitzgerald and Kelvin Beachum and former NBA star Baron Davis, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the details are private. The size of the round is close to $10 million, said another source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The seed+ round is being raised at an uncapped valuation, one of the sources said. Investing in an uncapped valuation round typically allows the participating investors to buy equity in the startup at a discounted valuation in the next round. Typically, it’s a 20% discount on the next round’s valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The deal has yet to finalize so the terms could change, sources cautioned.</p>
<p>Among those investing in the round are entrepreneur and investor Cuban, who also backed the startup’s seed round, Cuban confirmed in an email response to TechCrunch. “I love what we are doing. So yes I continue to invest. FSC [Fireside Chat] is the first Tactile Entertainment Platform and I think its upside is unlimited. Like their tagline says, ‘Feel the Audience,’&#8221; he told TechCrunch, without commenting on who else is investing in Fireside.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212217" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212217" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212217" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=1536,1069 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fireside.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212217" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside</p></div></p>
<p>Others who invested in the seed round are Precursor Ventures, Chris Voss and Sujay Jaswa, the sources said. Details about the early backers have not been previously reported.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A number of startups including Andreessen Horowitz-backed Clubhouse and David Sacks’ Callin are betting that the next wave of social networks would be built atop audio.</p>
<p>Fireside has been able to attract a number of high-profile creators to its platform, including Jay Leno and Michael Dell. The platform offers creators the ability to distribute their shows everywhere with the click of a button, and supplies them with what it calls &#8220;sophisticated analytics&#8221; to help them understand the kind of content that is resonating well with the audiences in real time.</p>
<p>The app &#8212; co-founded by Falon Fatemi, who previously co-founded customer intelligence platform Node &#8212; allows creators to sell tickets and subscriptions. The sources said that Fireside plans to explore use cases around NFTs and crypto as well as merchandizing to make the platform more enticing to creators.</p>
<p>“There is nothing else like it for content creators online. And what we will be able to do for metaverse-based venues is game changing as well,” Cuban told TechCrunch. “For the first time, whether it’s Web2, Web3 or VR, we have a tactile platform that allows content creators to hear and see how their audience is responding to live content. It&#8217;s as close to being in real life as you can get.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the crypto market continues to push toward new heights, investors are finding heightened LP appetite for exposure to the space, leading to new venture funds that are huge &#8212; even by 2021 standards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradigm</a>, a crypto VC firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, has closed its latest fund, and it&#8217;s a doozy. The firm announced a $2.5 billion venture fund, the largest crypto fund ever, shooting past the $2.2 billion crypto-centric fund Andreessen Horowitz announced this summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new fund and its size are reflective of crypto being the most exciting frontier in technology,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s co-founders wrote in a <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/11/paradigms-new-venture-fund/">blog post</a> announcing the fund&#8217;s debut.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Paradigm has been at the forefront of a class of so-called &#8220;crypto-native&#8221; VC firms that are aiming to out-maneuver investment orgs that place bets across the broader technology industry. Some of Paradigm&#8217;s most high-profile investments include FTX, Coinbase, BlockFi, Maker, Uniswap and Sky Mavis.</p>
<p>Paradigm now has an unrivaled war-chest to bankroll an industry that&#8217;s hotter and more varied than ever. The young firm has a major opportunity to establish itself deeper into the fibers of the crypto web, debuting its new fund during a time where traditional VC firms are being forced to reckon with the efficacy of their existing investment procedures and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/sequoia-dramatically-revamps-its-fund-structure-as-it-looks-to-rethink-venture-capital-model/">even their underlying structures</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Paradigm has around 30 employees according to their website. Earlier this month, they brought in Nathan Apsel as CFO (he previously held the same title at Joe Lonsdale&#8217;s 8VC).</span></p>
<p>Several of the major venture firms have been slow to embrace crypto, but Paradigm&#8217;s chief VC competitor will likely be Andreessen Horowitz, which is on its third crypto-centric fund and has made dozens of deals this year, minting new crypto unicorns and then doubling down on many of those same investments months later. The crypto arm has more than 50 team members, after having dramatically scaled hiring in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.lifen.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifen</a> has raised a $58 million (€50 million) funding round. The startup has been working on digital infrastructure for the healthcare industry, starting with medical reports. Indeed, 600 healthcare facilities are using the product to send and receive medical documents.</p>
<p>And each customer is using Lifen intensively as it represents 2 million medical documents sent to 240,000 doctors each month. Patients can also retrieve documents from Lifen directly, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.creadev.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creadev</a> and <a href="https://lauxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauxera Capital Partners</a> led today’s Series C round. Existing investors <a href="https://www.serena.vc">Serena</a> and <a href="https://partechpartners.com">Partech</a> participated in the funding round once again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234136" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lifen started with messaging in the healthcare industry as the company saw an opportunity for an upgrade. Many stakeholders in the industry used to rely on good old physical letters to send medical documents. And hospitals were stuck as they couldn’t just switch to email due to data privacy.</p>
<p>The startup built a document platform that works with several electronic messaging protocols designed for medical records. It makes it much easier to go paperless and send reports automatically.</p>
<p>Lifen has also added some machine learning on top of its document product. The company tries to detect key information automatically to turn documents into structured data. For instance, the startup tries to automatically identify the name of the patient as well as sender information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And now, the company wants to go beyond messaging with a full-fledged digital platform for the healthcare industry. Healthcare facilities can use Lifen to start using other e-health apps.</p>
<p>Lifen has its own <a href="https://www.lifen.health/en/marketplace/connected-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app store</a> that references all apps that work with Lifen’s user management system and connect with Lifen. This strategy has worked particularly well for Salesforce.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to hire more than 200 employees over the next 18 months. By 2025, the startup wants to work with 1,500 hospitals and 200 e-health solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based Tier Mobility, one of the largest e-scooter operators in Europe, has just acquired German bike-sharing platform Nextbike. The move signals Tier&#8217;s commitment to the same multi-modal approach that competitors like Lime and Voi have followed to take advantage of existing market share. It&#8217;s also the latest big acquisition in the micromobility industry that might herald further consolidation in the future.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Lime acquired Uber&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary Jump</a> and all of its e-bikes and e-scooters as part of Uber&#8217;s $170 million investment in the company. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">Lime raised $523 million</a>, which it says might be its last raise as it prepares to go public.</p>
<p>Tier and Nextbike did not disclose the terms of the deal, but Tier would have funded the acquisition with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tier-scoots-off-with-first-close-of-its-200m-series-d/">$200 million all-equity Series D</a> led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 it raised last month to scale its multi-modal market presence globally and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. The Series D followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/">$60 million debt raised this summer</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">$250 million Series C last November, also led by Softbank.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tier, which also has a fleet of e-mopeds, has been committing heavily to e-bikes in recent months with launches in London and Stockholm as part of a planned e-bike expansion across six countries. As part of the deal, Tier will acquire Nextbike&#8217;s fleet of around 115,000 analogue and electric bikes, as well as access to new territories per the 28 countries in which Nextbike currently operates. It will also acquire Nextbike&#8217;s headaches in certain cities.</p>
<p>Nextbike has just had to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59210989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspend operations in Cardiff and the Vale of Glanmorgan</a> in Wales after more than half its bikes were stolen and destroyed. The company, which has been operating its public bikeshare scheme since 2004, now has to repair and replace vandalized bikes, and the scheme might be permanently shut down in the area if the situation does not improve, but that problem will ostensibly now fall to Tier to handle.</p>
<p>Tier, which operates in more than 160 cities across 16 countries in Europe and the Middle East, does not already have a presence in Wales. Combined with Nextbike, Tier will have more than 250,000 vehicles in over 400 cities. Its fleet will include bicycles, e-bikes, cargo bikes, e-scooters and e-mopeds in free-floating, station-based and hybrid sharing systems, according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition of Nextbike – with its unrivalled experience and relationships across hundreds of cities – is a unique opportunity to take bikeshare to the next level, getting more people out of cars and offering the most sustainable mobility solution,&#8221; Lawrence Leuschner, CEO and co-founder of <span class="il">Tier, said in a statement.</span> &#8220;Our shared values of sustainability and respect for cities across two strong leadership teams, underpinned by Tier&#8217;s financial backing and capital efficiency, present an unstoppable, joint mission to change mobility for good.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/peloton" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>Peloton</ins></a> has filed fresh lawsuits against two of its rivals, iFit and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/echelon/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>Echelon</ins></a>. It alleges that the companies are violating up to four patents it holds related to on-demand classes, one of which it only obtained last week, as <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/peloton-sues-ifit-echelon-over-new-patent-for-on-demand-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Bloomberg Law</ins></em></a>notes. Peloton is seeking a court order to block sales of the devices until the patents expire, in addition to compensation. In both suits, Peloton accuses competitors of attempting to &#8220;free ride&#8221; off its technology.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://insight.rpxcorp.com/litigation_documents/14499580" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>iFit complaint</ins></a> concerns <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nordictrack/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>NordicTrack</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ProForm/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>ProForm</ins></a> and FreeMotion products that use the company&#8217;s leaderboard and/or its ActivePulse or SmartAdjust features. &#8220;Prior to the actions giving rise to this suit, iFit Functionality never delivered live classes — i.e., classes taught by instructors and streamed to users’ devices in substantially real time — or offered its members the ability to participate in competitive classes via a leaderboard. Instead, iFit Functionality only allowed subscribers to follow along with pre-recorded exercise classes on their machines, without any sort of community engagement,&#8221; Peloton wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>It accuses iFit of &#8220;profiting immensely from this infringement.&#8221; In October, iFit paused its plan to go public due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/nordictrack-maker-ifit-postpones-ipo-citing-market-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>adverse market conditions</ins></a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As for Echelon, Peloton is targeting the Smart Connect EX1, EX3, EX4s, EX5, EX5s, EX-7s, EX-Pro and GT+ bikes; Stride and Stride-5s treadmills; Row, Row-s and Row-7s rowers; and the Echelon Fit app. Peloton <a href="https://insight.rpxcorp.com/litigation_documents/14499574" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>claims that</ins></a>, before it released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-sale-120039581.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1"><ins>Tread</ins></a>, &#8220;it was not well-known for treadmills to offer a leaderboard&#8221; and that Echelon now has a &#8220;copycat leaderboard&#8221; with an &#8220;&#8216;Online Filter&#8217; that allows users to &#8216;see who is taking an On Demand class at the same time.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Peloton has had a thorny relationship with both companies over the last few years. It has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/peloton-claims-boring-nordictrack-maker-copies-fitness-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="1"><ins>sued iFit</ins></a> (previously known as Icon Health and Fitness) over patent infringement in the past <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/business/peloton-nordictrack-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="33" data-v9y="1"><ins>and vice versa</ins></a>. Peloton also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-19-flywheel-sports-bike-peloton.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="34" data-v9y="1"><ins>filed suit</ins></a> against Echelon in 2019 for, among other things, &#8220;imitating the Peloton Bike experience.&#8221; Engadget has contacted iFit and Echelon for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1460304788621508618?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating its web platform</a> to change the way users see new tweets. The social media giant will no longer automatically refresh timelines on the web with new tweets, and users can now decide when they want to load new tweets. Twitter acknowledged that in the past, tweets would often disappear from view mid-read when a user’s timeline would automatically refresh. Now, users can load new tweets when they want to by clicking on the tweet counter bar at the top of their timelines.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update to the disappearing Tweet experience is rolling out for web! Now you can choose when you want new Tweets to load into your timeline –– click the Tweet counter bar at the top.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1460304788621508618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234280" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In September, the company noted it would be rolling out updates to the way it displays tweets so that they wouldn’t disappear while users were still reading them. It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Twitter&#8217;s iOS and Android apps also don&#8217;t automatically refresh users&#8217; timelines when they open up the app. Instead, users can click on the highlighted home button on the navigation bar to load new tweets.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently announced that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/twitter-no-longer-crops-image-previews-on-the-web/">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web, after rolling out full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them.</p>
<p>These tweaks come as Twitter has been working to enhance its platform and make its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. It also launched its premium subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a>, in the U.S. and New Zealand on Monday, following its initial rollout in Canada and Australia earlier this year.</p>

<p>The devices are successors to the Forma and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/kobo-brings-brings-the-forma-form-factor-to-a-cheaper-model/">Libra H2O</a>, the forma of which (forgive me) has been my daily driver since I cracked the screen of my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/">beloved Boox Poke 3</a>. The main differences between the two new readers is size; most of the other features are the same. At $260 and $180 the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-sage">Sage</a> and <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-2">Libra 2</a> aren&#8217;t cheap, though I think at least the latter is worth considering if you use an e-reader regularly and like audiobooks and Pocket.</p>
<p>The most visible new feature is the screen, which is the latest Carta 1200 E Ink display. Both readers have 300 ppi, which is more than enough to make the text look sharp. Comparing the older Forma to the Sage (as they have very similar builds) I was surprised to find that the new screen really does make a difference; the contrast is noticeably improved and the Forma&#8217;s letters seemed slightly grey next to the much darker Sage&#8217;s. Both look excellent, to be clear, but the new screen is an improvement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Operation is much the same as previous devices, though the upgraded internals mean these are a bit quicker to wake, navigate and reorientate when you flip them. Once in a book, page turns took about the same amount of time as older devices, which is to say nearly no time at all even when skipping a few at a time. But when loading a whole new part of the book I found the old Forma is actually faster. All of this to say it&#8217;s fine but don&#8217;t expect iPad-like fluidity out of these or any e-reader.</p>

<p>The audiobooks are a new thing for Kobo and the new devices have Bluetooth connections to make it possible — no speakers. Syncing a pair was as easy as it is on any other device, and from there I listened to a bit of one of the included books from Kobo&#8217;s store (you can&#8217;t load your own, for now) and it was pretty much as expected. You can speed up and slow down playback, skip forward and backward, and it keeps your place if you disconnect or shut it down. Audio quality was fine, apart from the usual small glitches that happen with accelerated playback.</p>
<p>Using a stylus on a device this size has never seemed practical to me, but I can certainly see it might be useful for an editor or something who likes to mark up their books. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/kobo-elipsa-review-a-sized-up-e-reading-companion-with-clever-note-taking/">I found on the Elipsa</a> that the functionality is … well, functional. Nothing fancy, just a few ways to directly mark up your books and documents. A symbol or notation-based way to add notes you can reference later (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sony-and-remarkables-dueling-e-paper-tablets-are-strange-but-impressive-beasts/">Sony&#8217;s stars</a>) would be nice, but they&#8217;re just getting started. At any rate the stylus works just fine, but since there&#8217;s no place to put it you&#8217;ll probably lose it in short order.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234307" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234307" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2234307" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp" alt="The Sage ereader on a table next to a laptop." width="900" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sage-kobo.webp?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2234307" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kobo</p></div></p>
<p>Both devices have gotten thicker than their predecessors, presumably to accommodate the new hardware and stylus detection layer. It&#8217;s not an improvement, in my opinion, and the devices feel cheaper than the Forma and to a lesser extent the Libra H20. The body feels more like molded plastic than something sculpted, partly because they did away with all the decisive angles and wedges that made the Forma such an interesting shape. The new readers are also heavier than the old ones, which weren&#8217;t among the lightest to begin with.</p>
<p>Kobo has never been good at buttons, and these are no exception. The page turn buttons, especially on the Sage, are soft and indecisive and its recessed power button, while an improvement over the Forma&#8217;s awful side one, is still not great. The smaller Libra 2 fares better, with clickier but not too clicky buttons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234312" style="width: 957px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp" alt="" width="947" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp?resize=768,249 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sage_Side.webp?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2234312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kobo</p></div></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of the changes, as you can tell, but it&#8217;s not like it ruins the whole thing. But I hope that Kobo reclaims a bit of that premium feel in its next generation, because this has definitely been a step back.</p>
<h2>The SleepCover makes it and/or breaks it</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2234302" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234302" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2234302" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg" alt="The Kobo ereaders in their sleep cases." width="1024" height="722" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=1536,1083 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=2048,1443 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-15-11.58.57.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2234302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The recommended accessory for both devices is a $40 SleepCover or PowerCover. These leather-esque (not sure if real or fake, but it feels nice) folio covers attach securely and, like others on the market, wake your reader or put it to sleep when you open or close them respectively. These new ones add an origami-like fold system that lets them stand up at an angle.</p>
<p>I prefer my e-readers naked, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting to like these — and on the larger Sage, I didn&#8217;t. Already rather large, the Sage with the case becomes even larger, the folding bit seemed too loose and it covered up the power button. Even though it&#8217;s kind of superfluous, this bothered me. Yet without it the Sage seemed a bit fragile and lackluster.</p>
<p>On the smaller Libra 2, though, I <em>loved</em> the cover. It turned the somewhat plasticky device into a much more premium-feeling one, and the red color is actually quite attractive (plus the power button is accessible). Not only that but the fold-out piece is great for both setting it down and holding it — giving a bit more shape to it, like folding back the first half of a paperback. The recessed screen (I prefer a flush one) is protected from grime as well. While I still prefer the Boox&#8217;s ultra-compact, ultra-smooth design, the Libra 2 quickly ascended to second place for times when I&#8217;m not so worried about the space it takes up.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;PowerCovers&#8221; for more money, but if your device already lasts weeks, I don&#8217;t see the utility in adding more weight and bulk just so you can last a couple <em>more</em> weeks.</p>
<p>My final recommendation here is to skip the Sage and the PowerCovers — if you want big, go big and get an Elipsa or reMarkable. If you want Kobo and you want audiobooks, grab the Libra 2 and a SleepCover — you&#8217;ll love it. If you don&#8217;t need audiobooks, you can still grab a Forma. All the devices and accessories are available now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mitra Future Technologies, also known as <a href="https://mitrachem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitra Chem</a>, has raised a $20 million Series A led by billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Holdings. The startup aims to boost the North American battery supply chain industry that’s currently dominated by China, by producing an iron-based cathode for non-Chinese applications.</p>
<p>Taiwanese billionaire Richard Tsai, Fontinalis Partners, Integrated Energy Materials and Earthshot Ventures also participated in the round. Palihapitiya and Will Drewery, who headed global supply management at Tesla and is currently VP of supply chain at launch company Astra, also joined the startup&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Iron-based battery chemistries in particular have predominated entirely in China, while nickel-based batteries have been more popular in the West, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/">due to a series of key patents</a> that gave Chinese firms exclusive rights to manufacture iron batteries. But as those patents are soon to expire, iron-based batteries have become an increasingly popular choice for automakers, including Tesla, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-earnings-iron-batteries-evs-globally/">recently confirmed</a> that the cheaper battery chemistry will come standard across all global Model 3 and Model Y models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234275" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While automotive OEMs are embracing iron-based chemistries, China’s dominance poses a problem. “This is a huge Achilles&#8217; heel,” Vivas Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Mitra Chem, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>To fill this supply chain gap, the company is planning on manufacturing an iron-based cathode for application in non-Chinese batteries. To Kumar, who previously worked on the battery supply chain team at Tesla, the decision to go with iron isn’t merely an issue of geopolitics; it’s also a function of the growing market demand for EV batteries, particularly as automakers release EVs across a range of models and to fill a wider swath of consumer need.</p>
<p>“If you look at batteries as being the biggest part of the bill of materials of a vehicle, and also the part of the electric vehicle that defines the performance for the whole vehicle, it was only a matter of time before that differentiation by application needed to happen, where one-size-fits-all cathode solutions that are used in the market today just wouldn&#8217;t cut it,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that it also makes business sense to create a vertical supply chain hub here in the United States, particularly as more North American OEMs &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/gm-builds-new-center-to-unlock-cheaper-longer-range-batteries/">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/">Ford</a> &#8212; announce domestic battery cell factories in partnership with battery manufacturers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mitra Chem is currently in the process of building a lab in Mountain View, California, that will be capable of producing pre-pilot production capacity by the middle of 2022. The company says it will employ a machine learning process, pioneered by co-founder and Stanford University materials science professor Will Chueh, to take the cathode from lab to production-scale faster than its competitors.</p>
<p>China is the largest player in the battery industry across all stages of the supply chain, from refining raw materials to manufacturing essential components to producing the final lithium-ion battery cell, according to industry intelligence firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.</p>
<p>China produces around 66% of the global production of components like cathodes and anodes, which <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a> called “the core building blocks of the lithium-ion battery.” The country also leads in the number of planned large-scale battery factories, with 148 of the 200 facilities planned through 2030 located there, Benchmark found.</p>
<p>Kumar likened the current situation with the battery supply chain to the United States’ historical position with regard to oil.</p>
<p>“We need to keep in mind that for 75 years, the United States was a net importer of oil, and that energy disadvantage had massive implications to the American consumer, and to our positioning against other sometimes hostile nations,” he said. “We see the same happening right now. […] Not having some semblance of a supply chain in North America, being 100% exposed to external parties — because there is zero cathode capacity in North America today — will leave us exposed in the same way that we have been exposed in the energy topic in the past.”</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I used to write TechCrunch’s travelers&#8217; gift guide. It was fun and people liked it. People love travel gadgets! Of course, the events of last year left many of us grounded for an extended period, so we shifted to a remote work gift guide &#8212; assuming that, by 2021, we’d be back to traveling.</p>
<p>The best laid plans, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For most of us with office jobs, remote work is going to be the default for the foreseeable future &#8212; for better and worse. In fact, it’s a safe bet that the pandemic is going to radically change the way many businesses think about working. Since it’s more than just a passing fad, what better time to make the home office a bit more comfortable for the remote worker in your life?</p>

<p>I included an Intel iMac model in last year’s roundup, so you know I’m going to add the M1 model introduced earlier than this year. Downsides out of the way first: 1. It’s smaller, currently only available in 24-inch. 2. It needs more ports. I really want an SD card reader back (been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BZZ8PBL/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09BZZ8PBL&amp;linkId=4ad911a98c6c908ff999a91c5c8c73ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeing this one from Satechi</a>). 3. Not all apps are supported by the new M1 chip.</p>
<p>That said, the new iMacs are powerful, compact and look great. If you want to splurge on someone who’s been struggling to adapt to working from home, this is a great addition to any home office.</p>

<p>If an all-in-one desktop isn’t their thing, a great laptop stand makes a big difference. There are a ton of different options out there (and you can get one for fairly cheap). It’s a simple product on the face of it, so mostly you’re choosing between aesthetics. Twelve South’s stuff is always solid, so this is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Speaking of stands, this is a clever (not to mention extremely affordable) standing desk converter. A full standing desk might well be out of your budget &#8212; not to mention the cost and pains of shipping something that size as a gift. This sits on top of a desk and adds up to 16.5 inches in height for laptops up to 15 inches.</p>
<p>It’s a nice way to take a break for so many consecutive hours of sitting. Haven’t you heard? Sitting is the new smoking.</p>

<p>If you follow me on Twitter, you know that the past year-and-a-half has been…a struggle to work from home. My issue of five concurrent construction projects in ear shot might be a very New York one, but we all struggle from time to time with unwanted noise &#8212; particularly those of us in big cities. A good pair of noise-canceling headphones can be a life &#8212; or at least sanity &#8212; saver. Seriously.</p>
<p>There are plenty of great earbuds to be had for a decent price, but if you really want to drown out the sound, look into an over-ear model. The natural sound-muffling cups pairs well with built-in active noise canceling. That’s doubly the case if you plan to wear them for an extended period &#8212; they’re far more comfortable and the battery lasts a lot longer. Most models should get you through more than a day of use on a charge &#8212; teleconferencing meetings included.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good options. Bose just released new Quietcomforts, for example. But while the Sony WH-1000XM4 are a bit long in the tooth these days, they’re still the reigning champion &#8212; at least until the M5 come out. They sound great, have solid noise canceling and are extremely comfortable. If you’ve seen me do any virtual interviews for TechCrunch, you’ve seen me with the M4s on my head.</p>

<p>Can you tell I stopped drinking? I’m, like, super into water now. Last year I sung the praises of the Aarke Carbonater. This time, I’m back to tell you about the Larq Pitcher. A Kickstarter success story from the same folks who made those wildly popular UV water bottles, the pitcher is based around the same principle.</p>
<p>Along with a carbon-based filtration system found in more traditional pitchers, Larq blasts the water with UV-C for an added level of purification. I’ve been using it for a few weeks as of this writing, and I dig it. We’re blessed with good tap water here in NYC (ask the people who make the bagels), but added peace of mind is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Like the Larq bottle before it, I was impressed by the design language here. I’ve never given a second thought to how pitchers work (it basically lives in my fridge), but hey, that’s a good-looking pitcher. I’ve also never considered the need for a connected app to let me know the filter’s health, but not a bad thing to have, either.</p>

<p>A great home office chair is something I suspect a lot of people didn’t think about prior to the pandemic. These days, however, it’s a lifesaver. Honestly, this is probably the number one purchase I’ve made during the pandemic in terms of my productivity and posture.</p>
<p>Made by Staples, it looks great and is solidly built (requiring some assembly, naturally). It offers a ton of support and comfort (including a headrest) at a good price. It’s easy to pay three or four times that for a decent chair, and listen, we’re not made out of money here.</p>

<p>The thing about built-in webcams is that they’re mostly terrible. It’s just not something most manufacturers think about, even as smartphone cameras have continued getting better and better. That’s begun to change a bit during the pandemic, but unless you’ve got a newer system, you’re probably out of luck.</p>
<p>These days, anyone with a desk job has spent more hours than they’d care to admit on camera, so they might as well make themselves look as good as possible. For a majority of folks, there’s no reason to go all-in on, say, a DSLR for virtual meetings. Elgato’s latest is a nice plug and play solution that’s highly customizable using the camera hub app.</p>
<p>Honestly, the system may have more firepower than most people need, shooting 1080p video at 60 FPS, but if you’re gonna be on camera a lot, you might as well look good.</p>

<p>A lot of people ask me which microphone I use for my podcast. Since moving virtual, I’ve recorded everything on the Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic. It also doubles as my meeting microphone. It’s a great sounding unidirectional mic that looks like a classic stick mic. The back has both a standard XLR and USB-C out, the latter of which connects easily to desktop.</p>
<p>This is about as plug-and-play as desktop microphones get, with few settings to fiddle with. Those settings are what tend to get most people in trouble. Just remember to turn the power on (a mistake I’ve made more than once).</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Driver monitoring systems (DMS) are fast becoming the leading automotive safety system in the world. In the United States, rapid growth of Level 2 driving assistance systems such as General Motors’ Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise are quickly expediting and greatly expanding DMS usage.</p>
<p>Driver monitoring systems use strategically placed cameras to ensure that the driver is paying attention to the road, awake and alert. The system is integrated into the vehicle and can be programmed according to a series of escalating actions, starting with a driver alert or warning and progressing to slowing or stopping the car if the driver is no longer able to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>Across the globe, DMS will become a standard safety feature as soon as 2023. Provisions in the U.S. bipartisan infrastructure bill will require the Department of Transportation to begin making rules to stop distracted and drunk driving as well as update the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). European standards, at first, will apply to distracted and drowsy driving. Eventually, Europe will require the systems to detect impairment to include alcohol and drugs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These technologies can’t come soon enough. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813060">caused</a> over 3,000 deaths in 2019, an increase of 10% from 2018. Drunken driving has increased, too. In 2019, 10,142 people died in drunken driving crashes. Early estimates from 2020 <a href="https://www.madd.org/press-release/alcohol-related-deaths-up-9-despite-fewer-cars-on-the-road-during-pandemic">point</a> to a 9% increase in DUI deaths. While many expected traffic deaths to decline during the pandemic, the opposite occurred.</p>
<p>The good news is that DMS is road-ready technology, already in use today. Every major OEM in the U.S. has plans to implement DMS soon. General Motors just announced its next-generation system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-to-introduce-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-system-in-2023-starting-with-cadillac/">UltraCruise</a>, which uses DMS to ensure motorists can drive when needed. According to GM, this Level 2 system will allow for hands-free driving in 95% of all driving situations. The current system, Super Cruise, is already being expanded across more vehicle models.</p>
<p>Worldwide, carmakers are also expected to rapidly increase the use of DMS in response to growing demand for driver assist systems and government regulations. A recent <a href="https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/its/benecost.nsf/ID/761a0e0595322c97852581fd004d9ba0">study</a> reported that advanced emergency braking systems alone could reduce crashes in light vehicles by 33%. These figures are impossible to ignore. To place that in context, traffic deaths <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">fell</a> 29% in the 39 years between 1980 and 2019.</p>
<p>If we were to apply a conservative effectiveness rate of 30% and assume high levels of DMS penetration in the vehicle fleet to address distraction, drowsiness and intoxication in 2019, it is reasonable to estimate that up to 4,200 fatalities and 315,000 injuries could have been prevented<strong>.</strong> Even if we reduce the effectiveness rate to 10% and allow for a ramp-up to high levels of DMS penetration over several years, there remains a dramatic improvement to the prevention of road trauma.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are often mentioned as key technological vehicle safety improvements. ADAS includes things like automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, blind-spot detection and other types of crash-prevention technologies. However, these technologies work best when combined with DMS.</p>
<p>For example, a car using DMS in combination with an AEB system would know if a driver is distracted. In this case, the car can increase the distance before the AEB system starts to stop the car. Similarly, lane-keeping assistance can become more sensitive and take over more vehicle control when the vehicle detects a distracted or drowsy driver.</p>
<p>In 2015, U.S. automakers agreed to include ADAS as standard equipment by 2022. <a href="https://www.euroncap.com/en">Euro NCAP</a> will require DMS as part of ADAS beginning in 2023. Combining DMS with ADAS creates a truly robust vehicle safety system.</p>
<p>DMS utilizes a closed-loop system, meaning all data stays onboard the vehicle. The camera that monitors the driver uses advanced algorithms and technology to “look” at data points on the eyes and the face. No video is recorded, and the system is not in place to “tattle” on the driver; rather, it provides real-time assistance and should not pose any privacy concerns for consumers.</p>
<p>It’s not just government rules and regulations driving DMS. Consumer Reports, a popular trade publication that many consumers consult before purchasing a new vehicle, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/whats-next-in-car-safety/">notes</a> the importance of DMS in vehicle safety.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) understands the potential of DMS and has included recommendations to accelerate advanced safety technologies in its latest <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/mwl/Pages/default.aspx">Most Wanted List</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, DMS has emerged as the clear leader in new lifesaving technologies. The technology exists and is being built into cars today. The emergence of driver assist technologies and government regulations will further expedite the rollout of DMS. The implementation of the U.S. infrastructure package is critical as it could help ensure 4,200 lives are saved from distracted driving every year.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A homepage that converts visitors into customers is one of the highest leverage assets a startup can have.</p>
<p>Once your website can convert cold traffic, you can spend more time and resources on acquiring new audiences.</p>
<p>This post is going to tear down the homepage of <a href="http://Customer.io">Customer.io</a>, a marketing automation platform that lets marketers design and execute customized campaigns. Customer.io has thousands of customers ranging from large enterprise customers to startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233573" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of a landing page so that you can apply the conversion and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Capture the reader&#8217;s attention right away</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When writing copy for the features section, you typically want to emphasize the problem your audience is facing. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The first thing a new visitor to your site sees is the section called above the fold (ATF). This section is critical because your visitor will decide whether to continue and scroll or bounce based on how useful your ATF is.</p>
<p>Customer.io&#8217;s ATF section has five pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: header, subheader, call to action, social proof and a visual.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233647" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233647" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233647" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png" alt="Customer.io's above-the-fold section has five pieces" width="1024" height="560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png 1585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=1536,840 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233647" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>A strong header that answers &#8220;why&#8221;</h2>
<p>The header of your ATF section should explain exactly what your startup does and why it&#8217;s important in a concise way.</p>
<p>A general framework for writing a good header: If a visitor reads only your header, they should still know who you are and why they should use your product.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Customer.io explains what their product is in two words: messaging workflows. The benefit of using Customer.io is that it enables users to build their dream workflows, which implies complete customizability.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233648" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233648" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png" alt="Customer.io has a header that concisely answers what its product does" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>A subhead that goes deeper</h2>
<p>The subhead explains how you&#8217;ll accomplish the promise of the header. Customer.io tells users that their automated messaging platform is how they let them build their own workflows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233649" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233649" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png" alt="The sub-head backs up the header" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Subheads can also work by bluntly calling out who the product is for. Customer.io specifies who their product is for clearly. Users will now think, &#8220;Do I consider myself a tech savvy marketer?&#8221; If yes, they will continue reading. If no, they will bounce, which is completely fine.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233650" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233650" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png" alt="The subhead highlights who the product is for" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Customer.io finishes their subhead with the main benefit it offers: Users make more money from their customers because they are able to understand them better through data-driven messaging.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233651" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233651" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233651" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png" alt="The subhead also communicates what the benefits are" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>How to write a high-converting call to action</h2>
<p>Calls to action (CTAs) are used to encourage visitors to engage with your site to further the relationship. It&#8217;s very difficult to convert a visitor into a customer without some type of action mechanism.</p>
<p>Often, you only want one CTA in your ATF section so that users only have one path to take. But if, for example, you have a demo request CTA and you notice not many people are signing up for it, adding a secondary CTA, such as a free trial, may be worth testing. Customer.io does exactly this because they likely know they&#8217;d miss a ton of potential customers without a free trial.</p>
<p>Although they give users multiple options, it&#8217;s clear they want users to request a demo because that&#8217;s the emphasized CTA. They probably know that users who get a full demonstration are more likely to be converted and retained.</p>

<h2>Adding visuals to explain another way</h2>
<p>Including a visual in your ATF section is only a good idea if it helps visitors understand the unique value of your product. Most cartoon explainers or stock images you see on company landing pages are arbitrary and meaningless.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say you should stop using drawn visuals. Instead, use visuals to show your product&#8217;s value. Customer.io&#8217;s visual works because they visualize how the workflow uses time to delay a push notification.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233653" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233653" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png" alt="Add visuals to show how your product works" width="1024" height="733" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png 1042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Add social proof to build credibility</h2>
<p>Social proof is crucial for establishing credibility. It&#8217;s also used to make visitors feel like everyone already knows about the product and they&#8217;re the ones missing out. Customer.io establishes credibility and bypasses any suspicion by saying 3,400 companies already work with them. They further prove their point by showing the logos of their most recognizable customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233654" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233654" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233654" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png" alt="Add social proof to build credibilty" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png 1331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233654" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Describe the features that make your product unique</h2>
<p>The features section will make up the bulk of your landing page. Features help users understand why your product is valuable to them. At the same time, it should address any concerns and handle objections proactively.</p>
<p>When writing copy for the features section, you typically want to emphasize the problem your audience is facing. This can be done by repeating the language you hear your customers using to describe their pain points.</p>
<p>Customer.io&#8217;s audience of tech-savvy marketers has a burning problem that doesn&#8217;t need to be further hyped by the copy. Instead, they focus on showing users how much better their life will be with their product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233655" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233655" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233655" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png" alt="Describe the features that set you apart" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png 1467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233655" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If you have a lot going on in one section, try using a contrasting visuals to guide the eye. Customer.io uses a yellow light bulb so that users naturally read from title to paragraph to image to social proof.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233656" style="width: 744px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233656" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233656" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png" alt="Use contrasting visuals to guide the eye" width="734" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233656" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Adding social proof to feature sections can make the claims feel more credible. Look at how Customer.io uses legitimate marketers to motivate users to look through the tabbed widgets. People, especially in the same profession, tend to look at and accept the decisions of others as correct.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233657" style="width: 744px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233657" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233657" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png" alt="Feature professionals from the industry to build credibility" width="734" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233657" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If users aren&#8217;t interacting with your widgets, experiment with multiple navigation options like tabs and arrows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233658" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233658" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233658" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png" alt="Use multiple navigation options to maximize how much visitors interact with widgets" width="965" height="818" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png 965w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=768,651 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=680,576 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233658" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Secondary features to give prospects peace of mind</h2>
<p>As visitors are scrolling through your landing page, it&#8217;s possible they can get fatigued by the time they&#8217;re halfway through reading. To make things easier, highlight the important parts of each feature. Customer.io highlights all the moving parts of an advanced messaging workflow to give users a dopamine hit: &#8220;Can they can really do all of this?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233659" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233659" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png" alt="Highlight the important parts of every feature to keep readers engaged" width="1024" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png 1338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=768,265 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=680,234 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233659" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Highlight a feature by describing how it applies to the reader</h2>
<p>Your feature copy should be continuously laced with benefits. Another way to accomplish the same outcome is by addressing objections your customer might have right away. This will have the same effect by giving your reader a sense of your trustworthiness and appealing to their logic.</p>
<p>For Customer.io, the level of customizability is great until the user&#8217;s logic brain kicks in and they think: &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ve tried setting something like this up in the past, and it never worked.&#8221; Customer.io hedges this by showing the technical specifics.</p>
<p>They also emphasize &#8220;Just a few clicks,&#8221; suggesting it&#8217;s easy to use and takes little time to set up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233660" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233660" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png" alt="Emphasize features and address objections proactively" width="1024" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png 1345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=680,284 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233660" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>The visual for the segmentation feature implies users will see more engaged customers when using their product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233661" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233661" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233661" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png" alt="Use visuals to explain benefits" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png 1405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/15-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233661" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>How to handle objections in your homepage copy</h2>
<p>Marketers know how nerve-wracking it can be to send an email campaign to thousands of people. Customer.io brings attention to this pain point and immediately handles it by highlighting their tech support teams and services.</p>
<p>A user might also think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my emails to bounce or end up in spam. I&#8217;m not sure I want to risk using a service like this.&#8221; That is why Customer.io ensures user emails get analyzed for maximum deliverability.</p>
<p>Some users understandably feel anxious about giving their data to a random &#8220;.io tech company.&#8221; To prove trust, Customer.io guarantees data protection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233662" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233662" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png" alt="Emphasize your trustworthiness by showcasing your data protection and privacy policies" width="1024" height="569" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png 1338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>How to establish credibility in your industry</h2>
<p>Using statistics can quickly establish credibility. If you come out and say you&#8217;ve sent 535 million webhooks last year, that implies you&#8217;re working with a lot of companies and those companies are using your product.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easier to explain the volume of data you&#8217;re able to handle visually than it is through a paragraph of text.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233663" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png" alt="Use statistics to establish and build credibility" width="1024" height="186" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png 1092w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=300,54 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=768,139 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=680,123 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Finish your page off with a final CTA and more social proof</h2>
<p>The last few sections of the landing page are about privacy, security and trust for a reason. Customer.io knows that no amount of painkilling features will win a user over without establishing trust. This is why they make sure to end the copy with a statement about how many companies trust them and include another company wall to the right of the CTA. It reminds visitors how credible they are.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233646" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233646" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png" alt="Use your last piece of copy to highlight your trustworthiness and end with a final CTA" width="1024" height="286" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png 1381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=150,42 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=300,84 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=768,215 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=680,190 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>How to apply this teardown to your homepage</h2>
<p>To summarize, here are the key points you should take away from this teardown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell users exactly who the product is for. This will make your target persona read more closely and send away those who wouldn&#8217;t purchase anyway.</li>
<li>If your main CTA is a demo request and you&#8217;re not getting many conversions, experiment with offering a free trial as an additional CTA.</li>
<li>The style of an image doesn&#8217;t matter. What matters is if it helps users understand the value of your product.</li>
<li>If your product is a painkiller, you don&#8217;t need to twist the knife further. Just match the emotions of your audience and show them your solution to their problems.</li>
<li>If your product targets a specific profession, use testimonials from people in the same profession and make sure to include the company name and job title.</li>
<li>If you find users don&#8217;t navigate through your tabbed widgets, experiment with multiple forms of navigation.</li>
<li>If your product&#8217;s biggest objection is security and trust, it&#8217;s okay to go overboard on objection handling.&#x200d;</li>
</ul>

<p>The beta is now open to everyone, and Season 1 of <em>Halo Infinite </em>multiplayer is underway three weeks early.

					<description><![CDATA[We won't know how special Podium truly is till it coughs up some new numbers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a> is back at the fundraising well this year, adding $201 million to its accounts at a $3 billion valuation (post-money).</p>
<p>The Utah-based company, which provides software services including communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/podium-rolls-out-payments-for-its-customer-focused-local-business-saas-service/">payments tools</a> to SMBs, last raised $125 million at a roughly $1.5 billion valuation. That deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">announced</a> in April 2020.</p>
<p>Podium CEO Eric Rea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising?sref=gni836kR">told Bloomberg</a> that the company has &#8220;well over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.&#8221; TechCrunch confirmed the metric with the company, though Podium declined to be more specific regarding its current ARR.</p>
<p>Podium previously <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tracking-podiums-revenue-growth-through-its-60m-series-b/">reached the $50 million ARR mark</a> around the time of its $60 million Series B in November 2018. And we know that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">climbed to $100 million ARR toward the end of 2019</a>. This makes the question of <em>how far above</em> the $100 million ARR mark Podium is today rather important &#8212; we can&#8217;t effectively calculate the company&#8217;s growth rate without an up-to-date figure.</p>
<p>Recall that Podium felt cheap during its last raise, given its revenue base and $1.5 billion price tag. The company declined to share a growth target for 2021 or answer our question regarding whether it hopes to match this year&#8217;s growth rate in 2022. Given that it has an ocean of new capital, we were curious about how bold its growth plans were for the coming year. Surely money helps.</p>
<p>The company also declined to share IPO plan timing or notes on any notable shifts in its economics. Podium only wants to talk about its new fundraising and valuation today, apart from some very non-GAAP figures like how many &#8220;local businesses&#8221; use its service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bummer, given that Podium, earlier in its life, was a great example of a company that was more transparent than most when it came to sharing financial information.</p>
<p>The lack of hard financial results makes Podium&#8217;s upcoming IPO &#8212; Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising">quotes</a> an investor in the company saying that it will &#8220;definitely&#8221; go public &#8212; all the more curious. Given that we are going to see results for Podium&#8217;s current performance inside of its eventual S-1 filing, why not tell us now? (In an email, Podium said regarding its IPO timing that it is focused on &#8220;supporting as many local businesses as possible.&#8221;)</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At CES 2018, Honda revealed several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-honda-3e-concept-robots.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">companion mobility robot concepts</a>. It&#8217;s moving forward with at least one of them, an autonomous vehicle that can go off road. Honda and engineering company Black &amp; Veatch have been putting the second-gen Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) through its paces at a solar panel construction site.</p>
<p>This was the first field test in which several AWVs were working together. The vehicles towed trailers and carried construction materials, water and other supplies across the 1,000-acre worksite. The AWV can carry a payload of up to 399kg (880 pounds) and tow a trailer with a total weight of 750kg (1,653 pounds).</p>
<p>In a video that shows off the AWVs, a Black &amp; Veatch employee notes that it can take a while to travel across such a large site. So loading up the vehicles with materials and sending them to another location can make things more efficient and cut down on employees&#8217; travel time, freeing them up to work on other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRtGYnBNG7U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Honda</a> created a high-definition map of the site so operators could set start and end points for the AWVs. It says the vehicles stopped within centimeters of their destinations. Along with operating autonomously, the AWV can be remotely controlled.</p>
<p>The company claims the vehicle can run for up to eight hours on a single charge, even in a high-temperature environment. The AWV uses a number of sensors for navigation, including GPS, radar and LiDAR, as well as 3D cameras for remote monitoring. Honda says that even with a maximum payload capacity, the AWV has a range of up to 27.9 miles, depending on the use case.</p>
<p>The automaker is aiming to improve the performance and design of the AMV as it iterates on the prototype (it looks kinda cute as is). It might offer the ability to add attachments and tools as well. Honda hasn&#8217;t revealed plans to release a commercial version of the AMV just yet, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.worldofsos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOS</a> already has a number of vending machines in the wild, dotted around the map in its native Boston. The company just closed a $3.4 million round to expand its offering of health and wellness products in vending machines in bathrooms. The vending machines are touch screens that also double as a &#8220;visually rich advertising and marketing platform,&#8221; just in case you were getting nervous at the desperate shortage of advertising in the world around us.</p>
<p>The latest round was led by the cleverly named <a href="https://forlater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Later</a>, which is the investment arm of Boston-based retail incubator <a href="https://itsfornow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Now</a>. Also participating in the round is a star-studded lineup of angel investors, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan family</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Cruz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoe Cruz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerod Mayo</a>, a New England Patriots coach and former player; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurhyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ju Rhyu</a> of Hero Cosmetics and others.</p>
<p>SOS&#8217; machines have been installed in a number of venues around Boston, including Fenway Park, Prudential Center, Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital, and State Street Corporation&#8217;s offices, as well as FLA Live Arena in Sunrise, Florida.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our machines transform a moment of panic into a moment of empowerment and choice,” said Robina Verbeek, founder and co-CEO at SOS. “We believe that convenient access must be paired with exceptional products and an elevated retail experience. ‘Quick and easy’ shouldn’t mean ‘cheap and shoddy,’ especially when it comes to women’s health. Everyone deserves better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-woman founding team and the company&#8217;s co-CEOs are Susanna Twarog and Robina Verbeek. They met as colleagues at financial services company State Street, and combined forces to solve the perennial problem of broken, out-of-stock tampon machines.</p>

<p>The team built its first version of the machine in 2017, and deployed the first vending machine at a location in 2020. The company&#8217;s mission is to replace the unreliable, ugly old metal boxes with modern devices and services that &#8220;delivers essential personal care and beauty products from today&#8217;s leading brands.&#8221; The company hopes that its five design patents will hold the competition at bay for long enough to get a foothold in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re proud to partner with SOS to meet the wellness and personal needs of our staff, fans, and the South Florida community,” said Panthers Chief Commercial Officer Shawn Thornton. “We hope the SOS smart machines give patrons peace of mind knowing they can easily access these wellness products while enjoying concerts, games or events at FLA Live Arena.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company&#8217;s next installation will bring an additional 35 SOS machines to the Florida Panthers&#8217; FLA Live Arena in Sunrise and five machines to the Panthers&#8217; IceDen in Coral Springs. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the coming months, the company is aiming to expand to additional cities and locations across the U.S., including New York, Florida, California and beyond.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> was a hot startup in 2014 when it nabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/18/mixpanel-raises-65-million/">a $65 million Series B</a> on an $865 million valuation, a sizable B round and valuation for those days. Today, seven years after that announcement, the company finally has a C round, a $200 million investment on a $1.05 billion valuation from Bain Capital Tech Opportunities.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-mixpanel-got-its-startup-groove-back-by-focusing-on-its-core-product/"> has gone on record</a> with TechCrunch that there are lots of reasons for the gap, and when it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/mixpanel-amir-movafaghi-ex-twitter-replaces-suhail-doshi-as-ceo.html">promoted COO Amir Movafaghi to CEO</a> in 2018, it was the first in a series of steps that it took to right the ship.</p>
<p>The company later decided to shut down adjacent messaging and A/B testing products to focus solely on the product analytics market. As it made these moves, it also began work to improve slipping customer satisfaction metrics like its net promoter score (NPS), which was sitting at 15 when Movafaghi was promoted, according to the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the focus shifted back to the core product, Mixpanel&#8217;s customer retention numbers, NPS and other related metrics have come back &#8212; NPS is up to 85 this year &#8212; and revenue improved alongside those metrics this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business performance has continued to accelerate, and all of the [reasons] that we gave to you last time [we spoke] around company metrics, the acceleration on the monetization side, all of those things have just continued to improve and get better,&#8221; Movafaghi told me.</p>
<p>When he took over in 2018, he was leading a company with the bones of a successful startup with $100 million in revenue and close to a $1 billion valuation. Now that it has surpassed unicorn status, he doesn&#8217;t shy away from the fact that there were ups and downs in the company&#8217;s 12-year history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our story, as you know, was not a straight line. Instead, there were definitely [points] at which we had to take inventory and ultimately put the company back on track.&#8221; He believes that perhaps they were a bit too early for the market, but as digital transformation accelerated during the pandemic, companies of all types increasingly needed the kind of product data analytics Mixpanel provides. Now, the company can take advantage of that with the new investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dewey Awad, managing director at Bain Capital Tech Opportunities, said that he was impressed with how Movafaghi dealt with the challenges of taking over a company in transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amir spent a lot of time thinking about the category, how the product fit in, what the [market] was that the company was successful in, and he doubled down on the product and the product-led sales motion, which required a lot more time, was much more complicated and required a lot more hiring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But beyond Movafaghi&#8217;s leadership, he ultimately likes the focus of the company and believes that product analytics is still a young market with lots of growth potential. He said Bain believed that Movafaghi&#8217;s focus on the core product analytics market, and the decision to ax messaging and A/B testing, was absolutely the right way to go.</p>
<p>Mixpanel now has the capital to invest in moving the market share needle through partnerships and other methods, while continuing to invest in its core product for its target enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2009 by Suhail Doshi and Tim Trefren and has raised $277 million with today&#8217;s round, according to Crunchbase data. Doshi was CEO from inception until 2018 when he moved to become chairman of the board.</p>
