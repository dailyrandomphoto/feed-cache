										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The share of exports from Africa to the rest of the world ranged from 80% to 90% between 2000 and 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has created a growing demand for Africa to be less dependent on commodity exports and focus on regional commerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does this decrease export dependence, but it also forms new markets for value-added goods to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be exchanged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, Africa is home to the slowest and costliest ports in the world. Reports say that sometimes it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">logistically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cheaper and faster for African businesses to trade goods with distant overseas partners than via Africa’s intracontinental trade corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a big problem and <a href="https://jetstreamafrica.com/">Jetstream</a>, a Ghanaian-based company proposing to change that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closed a $3 million seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local and international investors participated in the round. They include Alitheia IDF, Golden Palm Investments, 4DX Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Asia Pacific Land, Breyer Labs, and MSA Capital.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/miishe"> Miishe Addy</a> and <a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/solomon-torgbor-25169b18">Solomon Torgbor</a> in 2018. The founders started Jetstream to enable African businesses to see and control their own cross-border supply chains. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It aggregates private sector logistics providers at African ports and borders, and brings them online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founders&#8217; insight was around fragmentation problems and lack of coordination at African ports; an experience Torgbor was all too familiar with. He had worked at Maersk’s freight forwarding subsidiary Damco for eight years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he saw cargoes sitting for weeks at container terminals without moving forward in the supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The delays were due to errors and incorrect paperwork at customs, importers, and exporters not having working capital at the right time to pay their logistics bills and poor coordination on the ground. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For exports, the cargo volumes were sometimes too small to ship </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost-effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by sea freight</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171257" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171257" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171257" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?w=680" alt="Jetstream" width="680" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg 3232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=1536,1269 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=2048,1692 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jetstream-photo.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171257" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Miishe Addy (CEO) and Solomon Torgbor (COO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Addy taught business at Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST), a Pan-African incubator and entrepreneur training program. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before MEST, the law graduate from Stanford worked for management consulting company Bain &amp; Company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Torgbor spoke with Addy about the challenges he noticed at Damco, she immediately thought they were worth tackling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As he was talking, a light bulb went off and I thought. &#8216;These are exactly the types of problems that technology solves,&#8217;” the CEO said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We discussed and tried lots of different solutions for about a year and discovered that cargo aggregation generated strong traction almost immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jetstream started operations in Ghana in March 2019 with a Less Than Container Load (LCL) aggregation service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The service allowed agricultural exporters to group their shipments into shared sea freight containers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in November of that year, Jetstream added trade finance for customers who found it difficult to fill large </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Jetstream is white labeling the systems built internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to manage shipments and financing for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are different from a more siloed freight management system because we are leveraging financing to integrate the customs brokers, freight forwarders, shipping lines, airlines, and container terminals all onto the Jetstream platform so that shipments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be managed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and tracked every step of the way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are bringing many of the local providers online for the first time,&#8221; Addy said of the changes Jetstream has had to make along the way</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jetstream&#8217;s business model is straightforward. It charges for the freight, clearance, and financial services offered. For freight, it charges a per-container or per-kilogram fee. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For customs clearance, it charges a flat fee that varies depending on the tax category and location of the shipment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for financing and insurance services, it charges a commission on the value of the goods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being shipped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, inefficiencies and a lack of coordination between providers around the ports </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were made more evident </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and created stronger growth for Jetstream as its logistics service revenue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew 512% from March 2020 to March 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addy believes that the pandemic further intensified Jetstream&#8217;s vision to bring cross-border trade corridors online and drive toward an inflection point in the speed and growth of commerce on the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see a future where trade running on Jetstream’s digital rails has a powerful competitive edge on logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jetstream is to cross-border logistics what Flutterwave is to fintech in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” she continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_951217" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-951217" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-951217" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg 4272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_174080105.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-951217" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports estimate that the market for cross-border logistics services in Africa is about $32 billion in revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is predicted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to double in size over the next decade. For Jetstream, starting with Ghana is the perfect place to capture as much value and expand vis-a-vis the continent&#8217;s growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Ghanaian native, COO Torgbor hammers home this point. In a statement, he calls Ghana a springboard to intracontinental trade and intercontinental trade with other fast-growing emerging markets. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> West African nation currently sits at the helm of Africa&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacted, continent-wide free trade zone <a href="https://au.int/en/cfta">AfCFTA</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghana is also home to Port Tema, the <a href="https://www.freightnews.co.za/article/largest-port-west-and-central-africa-named#:~:text=It's%20official.,(GPHA)%2C%20Michael%20Luguje.">largest container terminal in West and Central Africa</a> that plans to handle one million containers a year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Port Tema, Jetstream counts an unnamed Asia-based global shipping line as a major early adopter and customer of its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has seen Jetstream&#8217;s business generate seven-figure revenue and Addy claims the startup grows more than 100% year on year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/how-african-startups-raised-investments-in-2020/">reports</a>, women-led startups in Africa attract less than 15% of the total VC investments that flow into the continent. However, many female-targeted funds have launched in the last couple of years to fill this gap and one of such participated in this round. <a href="https://www.alitheiaidf.com/">Alitheia IDF</a>, a VC firm focused on gender-diverse startups, usually invests five- to seven-figure sums and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/these-investors-want-to-back-ridiculously-early-female-led-african-startups/">one of the few venture capital firms in Africa</a> tackling the low access to funding for women-led teams. Thus, Jetstream&#8217;s funding presents a rare win for this demographic (investors and founders alike) especially for the latter who are based in Ghana where few female tech CEOs exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addy tells me she looks forward to when more <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1969926/investors-are-finally-taking-africas-female-founders-seriously/">African female-led teams are well funded</a>, wishing Jetstream could help set off the trend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I especially hope that our business growth encourages the investor side of the tech ecosystem to take a second look at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the women leaders who aren&#8217;t</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded,&#8221; she commented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That aside, Jetstream also has operations in Nigeria with agents present in South Africa, China, the U.S., the U.K., and Europe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This talent placement is one of Jetstream&#8217;s moves geared towards 2028 when the CEO says the company hopes to have a presence at ports and borders in Africa comprising 80% of the continent’s total global trade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Family offices have existed since the 1800s, but they&#8217;ve never been so manifold as in recent years. According to a <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/uhnw/global-family-office-report/global-family-office-report-2019.html">2019 Global Family Office Report</a> by UBS and Campden Wealth, 68% of the 360 family offices surveyed were founded in 2000 or later.</p>
<p>Their rise owes to numerous factors, including the tech startups that mint new centi-millionaires and billionaires each year, along with the increasingly complex choices that people with so much moolah encounter. Think household administration, legal matters, trust and estate management, personal investments, charitable ventures.</p>
<p>Still, family offices tend to cater to people with investable assets of <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-emergence-of-the-family-office.html">$1 billion or more</a>, according to KPMG. Even multi-family offices, where resources are shared with other families, are more typically targeting people with at least $20 million to invest. That high bar means there are still a lot of people with a lot of resources who need hand-holding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.harnesswealth.com/">Harness Wealth</a>, a three-year-old, New York-based outfit that was founded by David Snider and Katie Prentke English to cater to individuals with increasingly complex financial pictures, including following liquidity events. The two understand as well as anyone how one&#8217;s vested interests can abruptly change &#8212; and how hard these can be to manage when working full-time.</p>
<p>Snider got his start out of school as an associate with Bain &amp; Company and later as an associate with Bain Capital before becoming the first business hire at Compass and getting promoted to COO and CFO after the real estate company&#8217;s $25 million Series A raise in 2013. Compass grew, of course, and now, less than four months after its late-March IPO, it boasts a market cap of nearly $27 billion.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the years, Snider, who rejoined Bain as an executive-in-residence after 4.5 years with Compass, spied an opportunity to bring together often siloed businesses like tax and estate and investment planning, including it because &#8220;it resonated with me personally. Despite all these great things on my resume, every six months I found something I could or should have been doing differently with my equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prentke English also has much in common with the clients Harness Wealth is targeting. After spending more than six years at American Express, she spent two years as the CMO of London-based online investment manager Nutmeg. She left the role to start Harness after being introduced to Snider through a mutual friend; in the meantime, Nutmeg was just <a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/jp-morgan-buys-digital-wealth-manager-nutmeg">acquired</a> by JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>While there is no shortage of wealth managers to whom such individuals can turn, Harness says it does far more than pair people with the right independent registered investment advisors &#8212; which <em>is</em> a key part of its business. It also helps its customers, depending on their needs, connect with a team of pros across an array of verticals &#8212; not unlike the access an individual might have if they were to have a family office.</p>
<p>As for how Harness makes money, it collects part of the fee that advisers on the platform charge for their services. Snider says the percentage varies, though it&#8217;s an &#8220;ongoing revenue share to ensure alignment with our clients.&#8221; In other words, he adds, &#8220;We only do well if they find long-term success with the advisers on our platform,&#8221; versus if Harness merely collected a lead generation fee at the outset.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the company thinks it can replace a lot of the do-it-yourself services available in the market, like Personal Capital and Mint, and it suggests it is making headway, with a ballooning base of customers that include employees of Coinbase, UiPath, Paypal, Snowflake, Doordash, and Amazon, as well as partners at venture firms.</p>
<p>That confidence is rooted in part in Snider&#8217;s experience with Compass, which, in its earlier days, thought it could navigate around real estate agents but &#8220;found that while people wanted better data insights and a better UX, they also wanted that coupled with someone who&#8217;d had many clients who looked like them,&#8221; says Snider. Prentke English joined forces with him after discovering that Nutmeg, too, was &#8220;running into the limitations of a non-human-powered solution,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Investors think the thesis makes sense, evidently. Harness just closed on $15 million in Series A funding led by Jackson Square Ventures, a round that brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $19 million.</p>
<p>As for what Harness Wealth does with that fresh capital, part of it, interestingly, will be used to develop its own captive business line called Harness Tax. As Snider explains it, more of its clients are finding that tax planning is among their biggest concerns, given all that is happening on the IPO front, with SPACs, with remote work, and also with cryptocurrencies, into which more people are pouring money but around which the tax code has been playing catch-up.</p>
<p>It makes sense, given that tax planning can be time-sensitive and often dictate the overall financial planning strategy. At the same time, it&#8217;s fair to wonder whether some of Harness Wealth&#8217;s adviser partners will be turned off from working with the outfit if it thinks its partner is evolving into a rival.</p>
<p>Snider insists that Harness Wealth &#8212; which currently employs 22 people and is not-yet profitable &#8212; has no such designs. &#8220;Our goal is only to help people where we can add value, and we saw an opportunity to lean in on tax side.&#8221; Harness has a &#8220;a very large population of people who may not understand their tax liabilities&#8221; because of the crypto boom in particular, he explains, adding, &#8220;We want to make sure we&#8217;re front and center&#8221; and ready to help as needed.</p>
<p>Others of Harness Wealth&#8217;s new and existing investors include Bain Capital; Torch Capital; Activant; GingerBread Capital; FJ Labs; i2BF Ventures; First Minute Capital; Liquid2 Ventures; Alleycorp, Marc Benioff; Compass founder Ori Allon; and Paul Edgerley, who is the former co-head of Bain Capital Private Equity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, a Pittsburgh-based language learning business last valued at $2.4 billion, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1562088/000162828021013065/duolingos-1.htm">has officially filed to go public.</a></p>
<p>The 400-person company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">which we explored in great detail in our EC-1</a>, was co-founded by Luis von Ahn, the inventor of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, and Severin Hacker. One of the most revealing bits of its story? It&#8217;s a route to monetization as a then rare edtech consumer business based outside of Silicon Valley. The company has had a somewhat circuitous journey &#8212; full of trial and error &#8212; on finding the perfect business model. It eventually landed on subscriptions, despite an original distaste for it thanks to its mission to provide free education.</p>
<p>Luckily, the S-1 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1562088/000162828021013065/duolingos-1.htm#i0bdeca0cb60e438aaa7fdfbd87a2dfd7_38">reveals that its earlier decisions led to sharp revenue growth at the company</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The vast majority of Duolingo’s revenue comes from subscriptions. In the most recent calendar year, for example, the edtech giant generated 73% of its total top line from subscription incomes. That revenue was followed by advertising incomes and the Duolingo English Test (DET), which represented 17% and 10% of its top line in 2020. (Notably, von Ahn hoped that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/">the DET would be 20% of Duolingo’s revenue by 2019</a>, a figure that it failed to reach by some margin.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tHyEW1H1jR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">The product-led growth behind edtech’s most downloaded app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The product-led growth behind edtech’s most downloaded app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/embed/#?secret=tHyEW1H1jR" data-secret="tHyEW1H1jR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its multi-part business model appears to be paying off. The company’s revenue grew from $70.8 million in 2019 to $161.7 million in 2020, a 129% increase. Of course some of that growth would have happened sans the recent global pandemic, but it’s not hard to see some COVID-related acceleration in the figures. Duolingo also reported $55.4 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2021, representing a 97% growth from the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The company recently turned profitable on an adjusted basis.</p>
<p>But in more strict accounting terms, net losses have grown for Duolingo. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, for example, the company had net losses of 13.5 million, a sharp increase compared to the same period last year when it had net losses of $2.2 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the company’s GAAP net losses expanded from $13.6 million to $15.8 million.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the company’s net margin improved in 2020, as its revenue more than doubled and its losses barely crept higher. The company’s profitability or lack thereof should not prove to be a problem during its impending listing.</p>
<p>In its S-1 filing, Duolingo provided a placeholder $100 million figure for the funds it expects to raise; we’ll get a better idea of how much capital the edtech unicorn may onboard during its IPO when it sets an IPO price range after its roadshow.</p>
<p>The former startup is effectively the kick-off to the Q3 2021 IPO season, one that several inventors have told TechCrunch will be more than active.</p>
<p>Duolingo has raised $183.3 million in venture capital to date. Investors that have meaningful stakes in the company include NewView Capital, Union Square Ventures, CapitalG, Kleiner Perkins, and General Atlantic, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/understanding-duolingos-quiet-10m-raise/">recently got a spot on the cap table through a secondary transaction</a>.</p>
<p>At a run rate of around $220 million today and growth of more than 100%, Duolingo should not have a problem clearing its privately set $2.4 billion price tag. Unless public-market investors are concerned that the edtech market’s growth is mostly behind it. That Duolingo grew by nearly 100% in the first quarter could temper such concerns.</p>

<h2>Factoids and other joy</h2>
<p>TechCrunch is still digging its way through Duolingo’s IPO filing, but we’ve found a number of details that add more than a little color to its recent growth and business results. Here are some standouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “record low” attrition rate in 2020 in which only four employees, or 2% of its workforce left the company.</li>
<li>The company eventually plans to launch a “Duolingo Proficiency Score” across its offered languages, with the hopes of creating a “widely accepted indicator of language proficiency level and make Duolingo a global proficiency standard.”</li>
<li>It cited Apple’s “Translate” tool, an iOS app launched in 2020 that allows users to translate text sentences or speech between several languages, as a competitor in the ‘risk factors’ section.</li>
<li>And finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1407034043376574469">it confirmed</a> that it is seeking potential acquisition candidates to add complementary services to its startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Duolingo plans to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the ticker symbol DUOL.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, June 28. How much time did you spend on your phone this weekend? Too much? Not a lot? According to recent data on consumer app spending, you probably spent a pretty fair amount. Consumer spending on apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/consumer-spending-on-apps-hit-record-64-9b-in-first-half-of-2021-but-install-growth-slowed-to-1-7/">hit a new record</a> in the first half of the year, though the pace of growth is slowing.</p>
<p>Before we begin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership/">Extra Crunch is on sale this week</a>. Check it out here and support <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FxJIhq4rL._AC_SL1500_.jpg">The Good Ship TechCrunch</a>. &#8212; Alex</p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/surgical-robotics-company-cmr-raises-600m/"><strong>Surgical robots are big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News broke today that U.K.-based surgical robotics startup CMR has put together a $600 million round led by SoftBank’s second Vision Fund and Ally Bridge Group. CMR is now worth $3 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/etsy-acquires-elo7-known-as-the-etsy-of-brazil-for-217m/"><strong>Etsy acquires Brazilian rival:</strong></a> Also out today was news that Etsy, the consumer crafts marketplace popular in the United States, purchased its Brazilian cognate for $217 million. The deal for Elo7 follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/">Etsy’s recent purchase of Depop</a>. It appears that Etsy views at least a good portion of its growth through an inorganic lens.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/spacex-aiming-for-first-orbital-test-launch-of-starship-in-july/"><strong>SpaceX wants to send Starship to (near) space:</strong></a><strong> </strong>SpaceX’s Starship is <em>nearly</em> going to space next month, the company reported. Yep, Starship, the thing you probably most remember for blowing up during trials, could be headed to orbit in July. Don’t think that we’re knocking SpaceX for having some failed trials. The company used to crash rocket stages in reentry all the time. Now it lands them on drone ships with regularity. In space tech, perhaps you have to blow up before you can properly take flight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>To kick off today, we’re talking about Pittsburgh, a fascinating startup market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/calling-all-yinzers-techcrunch-is-virtually-headed-to-pittsburgh/">that TechCrunch is visiting in short order</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">Pittsburgh’s mayor on the city’s startup community and the difficulty of attracting venture capital:</a> </strong>How do you reinvent a city that was left behind by deindustrialization and wants to shake off its old reputation? TechCrunch got in the weeds with Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh since 2014.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/vcs-discuss-the-opportunities-and-challenges-of-the-pittsburgh-startup-ecosystem/"><strong>VCs discuss the opportunities — and challenges — in Pittsburgh’s startup ecosystem:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Of course, city government is only one piece of the larger puzzle of building a startup hub. The monied classes also have a part to play when it comes to creating a flywheel for startup creation, investment and re-investment.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/"><strong>How Carnegie Mellon is helping build its own startups and keeping them in Pittsburgh:</strong></a> And speaking of flywheels, another key component of any startup market that wants to be self-sustaining is helping keep its newly educated minds local, where they can build, scale, exit, and then put their capital and knowledge back to work.</li>

<p><strong>Moving to our regular fare, here’s more from today’s digest of startup happenings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/tapcart-a-shopify-for-mobile-apps-raises-a-50-million-series-b/">$50M to build the Shopify of mobile commerce:</a></strong> Tapcart wants to bring Shopify’s desktop shopping magic to the mobile world, and today it announced an eight-figure round led by Left Lane Capital. (To a degree, it reminds us of <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/24/why-you-have-to-pay-attention-to-the-indian-startup-scene/">recent YC grad Bikayi</a></strong>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/robotic-beverage-maker-botrista-raises-10m/"><strong>$10M for chilled robotic drinks:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, not drinks for robots. Robot-prepared drinks. We’ve seen startups building auto-baristas before, but Botrista’s machine could be something special. It looks slick, and we’d frankly drink most of its offered combinations. Let’s see how far 10 million bucks can take it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/sentinelones-upgraded-ipo-pricing-is-good-news-for-tiger-public-markets-and-your-local-vc/"><strong>Yet another hot software IPO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>SentinelOne’s IPO is looking spicy after raising its price range. The company’s valuation is creeping higher ahead of its debut, and should value the cybersecurity unicorn at a multiple of its final private price.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/paymaya-owner-voyager-innovation-raises-167m-from-kkr-tencent-and-ifc-will-launch-digital-bank-in-the-philippines/"><strong>$167M for a leading Philippines-based fintech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>PayMaya’s parent company is a lot richer today after closing $121 million in new capital along with $46 million from prior investments this week. Per TechCrunch, the funds will be used to “launch more financial services, including a digital bank.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/equity-monday-big-ipads-and-ballmer-era-google/">Today’s episode of the Equity Podcast</a></strong> features a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/thursday-snags-3-5m-for-a-dating-app-thats-live-once-a-week/">new spin on dating apps</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Closing, two from the personnel department:</strong> First, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-is-coming-to-disrupt/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. And Foursquare’s Dennis Crowley is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/foursquare-founder-dennis-crowley-steps-back-from-the-company/">stepping back from the company</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 data strategies for selling to developers</h2>
<p>Many consumers are open to a slick sales pitch, but software developers generally know better.</p>
<p>Successful dev-focused marketing efforts steer these users toward free tools, but unless you know exactly what data to look for and how to measure it, your efforts will have limited impact.</p>
<p>Software companies hoping to connect with developers should treat end users like the &#8220;go-to-market side of the team,&#8221; advises Sam Richard, senior director of growth at OpenView, which has invested in companies like Datadog, Expensify and Calendly.</p>
<p>For example: Instead of simply pulling analytics from your production database, what if your GTM team polled stakeholders who touch revenue about the data points they use to make decisions? If you assigned a product manager to address their needs, draft a roadmap and develop an MVP, how much could you learn?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t overthink it,&#8221; says Richard. &#8220;Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that both Microsoft <em>and</em> Apple are worth $2 trillion apiece? It was just a few years ago that the five largest American tech firms <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-5-biggest-players-now-worth-3-trillion/">were worth a mere $3 trillion</a>, though at the time that number felt <em>huge. </em>Today, however, Microsoft started to help chart its path to the $3 trillion mark on its own with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/the-first-preview-of-windows-11-is-now-available/">the release of the first official Windows 11 preview</a>. Sure, there have been some builds floating around, but this time the source code is from the code’s source.</li>
<li>Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/facebook-to-target-nigerian-learners-with-educational-app-sabee-created-by-its-rd-team/">a new product out in Nigeria</a> &#8212; where it has an office &#8212; called Sabee. TechCrunch reports that it “aims to connect learners and educators in online communities to make educational opportunities more accessible.” Facebook wants to reach all internet users, and Africa is a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1176668/internet-penetration-rate-in-africa-by-region/">growth market for internet penetration</a>, so the move makes sense.</li>
<li>For those of you out there invested in the Android wearable ecosystem, good news: Samsung and Google have a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/samsung-and-google-detail-wearable-platform-ahead-of-next-galaxy-watch-launch/">lot of new stuff that you are probably going to like</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A court case in South Korea has ended in a loss for Netflix and a victory for ISPs in the country, which may now be empowered to levy bandwidth usage fees on traffic-gobbling streaming platforms. The decision is likely to be challenged, as it essentially saddles the new wave of streaming services with ISP-negotiated rents just as the market is exploding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202106250013">As reported by the Korean Economic Daily</a>, the court&#8217;s decision is less prescriptive than an official &#8220;figure it out amongst yourselves.&#8221; But it fails to protect streamers from a class of bandwidth fees they have fought for years.</p>
<p>Netflix filed suit in 2020 alleging that the ISP SK Broadband had no right to demand payment for the bandwidth the platform uses, similar to a legal conflict that flared up around 2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back then, ISPs complained that streaming services consumed an inordinate amount of bandwidth and the companies should pay something to offset the cost of providing it. Streaming sites countered that they were simply fulfilling the requests of users who had already paid for the bandwidth in question, and that ISPs were trying to &#8220;double dip&#8221; and charge for the same bits twice.</p>
<p>The technical reality is a bit more complicated than that, though, and Netflix ended up paying what are called interconnect fees to facilitate the infrastructure necessary for the quick, consistent delivery of huge amounts of data. Netflix has said that this is basically a &#8220;fast lane&#8221; tax, but from the lack of chatter since the matter was settled back then, they seem to have chalked it up as the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>In a statement offered by its Korean subsidiary (reported in the same Korean Economic Daily story), Netflix said it &#8220;has not been paying network usage fees, or something equivalent to the fees claimed by SK Broadband, to any one of the ISPs in the world.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear whether it classifies interconnect and caching as &#8220;equivalent&#8221; or whether these arrangements have changed; I&#8217;ve asked the company for clarification and will add it to the story if they respond.</p>
<p>In Korea, however, the issue is not so settled, and with huge growth there, the streaming sites would probably prefer not to have to pay fees proportionate to their success — hence the lawsuit. But the court&#8217;s recent decision put the ball back in their court, saying that &#8220;it needs to be determined by negotiations between the parties involved whether or not some fees will be paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s welcome news for the broadband providers, since any fee they negotiate will be higher than zero, which is what they were working with before. What sort of money they can possibly demand is a complete mystery, since the space is changing so quickly. And the court case, since it&#8217;s so unfavorable to some of the biggest companies in the world (which stand to make a mint in the voracious South Korean market), will almost certainly be taken up again. In the meantime consumers in the country may well see streaming prices go up — a tried and true method of whipping up a froth of consumer outrage.</p>
<p>The issue is far from settled in the U.S. and elsewhere, as with a new Democrat-led FCC there may also be a new push for strong net neutrality rules. Netflix had pushed for this sort of fee to be outlawed during the original net neutrality push, but ultimately the idea was abandoned (and would later be mooted anyway when the rules were rescinded). The argument over what ISPs can and can&#8217;t charge for, and who should pay, is an ongoing and global one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“It is great that MWC is back,” Samsung UK’s James Kitto said, opening up this year’s presser. “And behalf of everyone at Samsung, it’s great to be back at MWC.”</p>
<p>What, precisely, it means to be “back” in 2021 is another question entirely. Samsung was, of course, one of a number of major industry players who announced that they would not be exhibiting at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was hard not to see an echo of last year’s event, when key players pulled out, one by one, forcing the GSMA to cancel the event altogether.</p>
<p>This year’s event is different for myriad reasons. For one thing, MWC’s traditional timeframe of late-February/early-March put the event directly in the crosshairs of COVID-19’s arrival in the EU. For another, this time out, the organizing body had another year to prepare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The simplest route would have been to do what the CTA did with CES and go all-virtual. The first all-virtual CES had plenty of issues of course, but attempting an in-person element ahead of a widespread vaccine rollout in the U.S. would have, at best, complicated things by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/spain-covid-cases.html">continues to be a concern in Spain</a> – as with much of the world. The GSMA opted to go ahead with the event this year, however, after pushing MWC back several months from its standard dates. The company has implemented all sorts of safety measures, but judging from early videos taken at the event, social distancing ought not to prove an issue on the show floor this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>It seems safe to assume that most who are “attending” the event are doing so virtually – a list that includes the vendors themselves.</p>
<p>Samsung is among those high profile companies that presented a pre-recorded virtual press conference. Perhaps companies still see value in being attached to this sort of event even if it’s virtual, or maybe the on-going partnership with the organization is worth nurturing. The cynical part of me wonders how many of the sponsored sessions just couldn’t be reversed.</p>

<p>Samsung’s event was arguably the biggest of the day, but the presser felt like little more than a placeholder. The biggest news of the press conference was an expansion of a partnership Google announced at I/O last month, while much of the rest of the stream was pointing toward an Unpacked event happening later this summer.</p>

<p>In fact, the event closed with a black and white slide reading “See you soon at the next Unpacked,” in case you didn’t get the hint. Bottom line: no hardware.</p>
<p>Lenovo, on the other hand, didn’t hold back. That’s due, in part, to the fact that the company releases a tremendous amount of hardware, so why not tie it to MWC, right?</p>
<p>The list of announcements inluces a new version of the Smart Clock Google Assistant alarm clock with a built-in wireless charging pads for phones and several tablets, including the Yoga Tab 11 and 13, which sport combination hanger/kickstand. The 13-inch system also doubles as an external monitor, which is when the kickstand really comes in handy.</p>

<p>TCL got out ahead of the event early, with the announcement of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-nxtwear-g-smart-glasses-and-multi-screen-collaboration-feature-announced-at-mwc-2021-301319326.html">NXTWEAR G</a> – a wearable OLED cinema display. The headmounted device approximates a 140-inch display with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

<p>Those are your top line headlines for the show so far. The event runs through July 1st, so still plenty of show left, whether or not anyone will be there to see it in person.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Email has the highest return on investment of any other marketing channel. On average, email earns you $40 for every $1 spent. And the best part is that email is an owned channel, which means you can reach your subscriber directly instead of relying on social media algorithms to surface your content.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://demandcurve.com">Demand Curve</a>, we’ve worked with over 500 startups, meticulously documenting growth tactics for all growth channels. We also incorporate what we&#8217;ve learned from our agency, <a href="http://bellcurve.com">Bell Curve</a>, which works with Outschool, Imperfect Produce and Microsoft to name a few.</p>
<p>To understand how to use email marketing effectively, we interviewed email marketers at this year&#8217;s fastest-growing startups. This post covers the most profitable tactics they use that capture 80% of the value using 20% of the effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>If people don&#8217;t open it, nothing else matters</h2>
<p>The subject line of your email is the most important, yet most marketers neglect it until after crafting the body of the email.</p>

			The subject line of your email is the most important, yet most marketers neglect it until after crafting the body of the email.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Increase the open-rate of your subject lines by making them self-evident. You don&#8217;t want people guessing why you want them to pay attention to your email. If the subject line is unclear or vague, your subscribers will ignore it.</p>
<p>One trick is to write like you speak. Try using subject lines that use informal language and contractions (it&#8217;s, they&#8217;re, you&#8217;ll). Not only will this save character count, it will also make your copy more friendly and quick to read.</p>
<p>Subject lines should be relevant to your subaudiences. Marketers generate 760% more revenue from segmented email campaigns than from untargeted emails.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170792" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170792" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170792 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png" alt="A good subject line will increase the chances of your email being read" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170792" class="wp-caption-text">A good subject line will increase the chances of your email being read. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re collecting emails from multiple areas on your website, chances are the context will be slightly different for each. For example, people who subscribe after reading an article on ketogenic diets should receive emails that further educate them on keto and seeds products relevant to that lifestyle. Sending them information and product recommendations for vegetarians would not be relevant and could lead to them unsubscribing.</p>
<p>To ensure you&#8217;re sending relevant emails to the right audiences, segment your audience using tags and filters within your email marketing platform. Each platform will do this slightly differently, but all modern platforms should allow you to do this. When crafting your email subject line, ask yourself: &#8220;Would this email make sense to receive for this segment of subscriber?&#8221;</p>
<p>Your subject lines should be short and concise. About 46% of all emails are opened on mobile devices, which means the subject line must be short enough to fit on a smaller screen while getting your point across. Fifty characters is approximately the maximum length a subject line can be before it gets cut off on a mobile screen.</p>

<p>Keeping your subject lines short also makes them easier to scan when your subscriber is looking through their inbox. Including emojis in your subject line can cut down your character count and emulates how friends send text messages to each other. Including emojis in your subject lines will make your email feel less corporate and more friendly.</p>

<h2>Designing emails that get read</h2>
<p>Once your subscriber opens your email, there are three outcomes that can follow: read, skim or bounce.</p>
<p>Subscribers that read your emails are the most valuable, because they will consume the full contents of your email. Skimmers will only read the headlines and look at the images you include. Subscribers who bounce will open your email, but if nothing catches their attention right away, they will simply delete or close your email.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to want to design your emails to minimize the number of bouncers, satisfy readers and provide enough high-level information that skimmers still understand your message.</p>
<p>To minimize the number of bounces, choose an email design that catches the eye and is relevant to your brand. Take the Casper email below for example. The starry night background and moon illustration is directly relevant to the mattresses they sell. Visually branded email designs will help elevate your brand perception.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170793" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170793" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170793 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png" alt="Design your emails to appeal to all kinds of readers" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170793" class="wp-caption-text">Design your emails to appeal to all kinds of readers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>To optimize for skimmers, write action-focused headlines. Use designs that draw the eye of your reader to key elements. As you can see in the Headspace example, the image of the rising sun pushes your gaze upward to the headline and the call-to-action button. Skimmers should be able to understand the context of the entire email and take action without needing to read the body.</p>
<p>To convert more readers, fulfill the expectation set by the subject line. Readers will be looking for any promises or hints you gave them in your subject line. Be sure to deliver on this promise in the body. Do so in an aggressively concise way — just because they&#8217;re reading doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t value their time.</p>
<h2>Call to actions that convert</h2>
<p>The goal of your body copy is to drive people to your call-to-action button (CTA). Your CTA is crucial, because it&#8217;s how you convert an email subscriber into a paying customer. To increase the conversion of your CTA, make a valuable promise in your body copy and headers that&#8217;s only delivered through your CTA.</p>
<p>Good CTA copy typically begins with a verb that teases what the reader will encounter next:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get</strong> your free sample.</li>
<li><strong>Redeem</strong> discount now.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the full inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-converting CTA copy is vague or nonactive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more.</li>
<li>See inventory.</li>
<li>Download.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your email should only have one CTA. Any more and your conversion will decrease due to unnecessary decision-making. Ensure that the page on your site that your CTA leads to fulfills the promise you made in your body and CTA button.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Once the focus of the subject line is clear and the desired outcome is chosen, everything else should be crafted to carry the reader step by step through the email, eventually taking them to the desired action.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to work backward from the desired outcome you want the reader to perform. If the desired outcome is for them to click on a CTA button, frame your subject line, headers and body copy as a valuable promise that can only be achieved by clicking the button.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of your email through the eyes of all three types of subscribers: readers, skimmers and bouncers. Use visual and written prompts that make the purpose of your email clear to all three categories. Failing to do so could lead to unsubscribes and lost revenue.</p>
<p>Email has the highest return on investment than any other marketing channel because you have a captive audience who has opted-in to you communicating with them. Email can drive six times more conversions that a Twitter post and is 40 times more likely to get noticed than a Facebook post.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest factors in the success of a startup is its ability to quickly and confidently deliver software. As more consumers interact with businesses through a digital interface and more products embrace those interfaces as the opportunity to differentiate, speed and agility are paramount. It’s what makes or breaks a company.</p>
<p>As your startup grows, it’s important that your software delivery strategy evolves with you. Your software processes and tool choices will naturally change as you scale, but optimizing too early or letting them grow without a clear vision of where you&#8217;re going can cost you precious time and agility. I’ve seen how the right choices can pay huge dividends &#8212; and how the wrong choices can lead to time-consuming problems that could have been avoided.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The key to success is consistency. Create a standard, then apply it to all delivery pipelines.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we know from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&#8217;s law</a>, your software architecture and your organizational structure are deeply linked. It turns out that how you deliver is greatly impacted by both organizational structure and architecture. This is true at every stage of a startup but even more important in relation to how startups go through rapid growth. Software delivery on a team of two people is vastly different from software delivery on a team of 200.</p>
<p>Decisions you make at key growth inflection points can set you up for either turbocharged growth or mounting roadblocks.</p>
<h2>Founding stage: Keep it simple</h2>
<p>The founding phase is the exciting exploratory phase. You have an idea and a few engineers.</p>
<p>The key during this phase is to keep the architecture and tooling as simple and flexible as possible. Building a company is all about execution, so get the tools you need to execute consistently and put the rest on hold.</p>
<p>One place you can invest without overdoing it is in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). CI/CD enables developer teams to get feedback fast, learn from it, and deliver code changes quickly and reliably. While you&#8217;re trying to find product-market fit, learning fast is the name of the game. When systems start to become more complex, you&#8217;ll have the practices and tooling in place to handle them easily. By not having the ability to learn and adapt quickly, you give your competitors a massive edge.</p>
<p>One other place where early, simple investments really pay off is in operability. You want the simplest possible codebase: probably a monolith and a basic deploy. But if you don&#8217;t have some basic tools for observability, each user issue is going to take orders of magnitude longer than necessary to track down. That&#8217;s time you could be using to advance your feature set.</p>
<p>Your implementation here may be some placeholders with simple approaches. But those placeholders will force you to design effectively so that you can enhance later without massive rewrites.</p>
<h2>Very early stage: Maintain efficiency and productivity</h2>
<p>At 10 to 20 engineers, you likely don’t have a person dedicated to developer efficiency or tooling. Company priorities are still shifting, and although it may feel cumbersome for your team to be working as a single team, keep at it. Look for more fluid ways of creating independent workstreams without concrete team definitions or deep specialization. Your team will benefit from having everyone responsible for creating tools, processes and code rather than relying on a single person. In the long run, it will help foster efficiency and productivity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Young startups need to be great at design, not just for their products, but for their brands. The pandemic made that all harder — but lessons are being learned. We caught up with Scott Tong, a startup design expert who advises early-stage companies, to learn more.</p>
<p>The office may still be the best place to hash out big multiteam decisions, he says, but new best practices and modern tools are making remote collaboration easier and easier.</p>
<p>Brand design seems to only be getting trickier, however. &#8220;To users,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;brand and product are lumped together and they each represent the other.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, many users have spent lots of time at home online, often thinking harder about world events and how they are living their lives. They&#8217;re scrutinizing what they can observe about a startup to see if its values line up with theirs before they make a decision to sign up (or quit).</p>
<p>The solution, in Tong&#8217;s view, is to create a unifying plan where design decisions can address problems before they emerge.</p>
<p>More details are in the interview below. For a full conversation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/product-design-expert-scott-tong-will-join-us-at-tc-early-stage-in-july/">check out Tong&#8217;s talk about design strategy</a> coming up at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021 – Marketing &amp; Fundraising conference on July 8</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic affected us all. How has it affected user-focused brand design?</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic drove people to consume even more media than before. News about science, politics, race and the economy were unavoidable. Brands have had to navigate a very complex landscape of topics that can be divisive. People increasingly identify with brands that are aligned with their values. But in order to understand a brand&#8217;s values, someone has to sift through competing signals — some from the brand itself, and others from vocal supporters and critics. Say the wrong thing and a brand can risk alienating large portions of their audience (including their own employees). If a brand says nothing, their silence can be interpreted as complicity. And if brand messaging comes across as unauthentic, it could spell disaster. It’s a difficult needle to thread. It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to run surveys to gather signals about how their brand is perceived by customers and noncustomers alike.</p>
<p><strong>What new things about users should startups consider when working on designing their identities? What are you advising startups now about designing their brands, versus what you said circa December 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Identities are only one part of a much larger constellation of touch points that make up a user&#8217;s perception of a brand. User expectations are extremely high and will continue to rise. Even with their free products, users have gotten accustomed to highly polished experiences. While &#8220;high quality&#8221; is table stakes for users, the challenge for a company is to pinpoint the handful of dimensions that matter most. That&#8217;s why constantly seeking to understand users is so important. Deeply understanding what they care about will help isolate those critical dimensions so teams can focus on areas that will drive the most meaningful impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Founders, help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>One recurring observation is that brand teams and product teams often sit in different parts of a company&#8217;s org structure. While there are reasons for this, it&#8217;s important to remember that users don’t care about your org structure. To users, brand and product are lumped together and they each represent the other.</p>
<p><strong>Internally, how are companies handling internal challenges like collaborative designing in a more remote world? In-person communication has been vital historically to get all parts of a company thinking in the same way. What is helping those who have gone remote-first succeed (tools, approaches to meeting and documentation, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Collaboration tools have never been more abundant. But while tools are plenty, norms around their usage can vary significantly from group to group, even within the same company. Where can I find the project brief? How many back-to-back meetings is too many? How are brainstorms run in a virtual environment? When do I use Slack versus email? Establishing those norms requires conversation and experimentation.</p>
<p>Along with norms around tools, it&#8217;s helpful to establish a cadence/rhythm that allows team members to get and stay in sync. Depending on the team, that cadence may be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly or quarterly, etc., but find the appropriate cadence for each audience.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively, do you think the demands of good design work will motivate more early-stage startups back into in-person office work?</strong></p>
<p>There are varying opinions on whether being in-person spurs innovation or productivity. The pandemic has forced us all to adapt, and design is no exception. It&#8217;s been encouraging to see good design happen in remote work environments, and a lot of that has been enabled by tools and the norms around their usage. While I personally would prefer being in-person, especially at the early stages of company building, I think it&#8217;s entirely possible to establish a high-functioning team in a remote environment. Of course there are cases &#8212; like hardware or soft goods &#8212; where tactile feedback is important and hard to replicate remotely. But even then I&#8217;ve seen some successful workarounds (for example, sending the same material sample to every team member). Given that this is all still very new, there will inevitably be hiccups along the way. But a team of willing participants with the right mix of tools and norms can make it work.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, with more teams remote and distributed, it may be even more natural than before to work with a third-party brand design expert. When do you advise startups to bring in an outside consultant today, and how should they work with them?</strong></p>
<p>This depends largely on how design is valued within an organization &#8212; as a service or as a partner.</p>
<p>If design is viewed as a partner, then the relationship is ongoing and iterative. This means design is a function that builds, measures and learns alongside their product and engineering counterparts and the benefits of institutional knowledge compound over time.</p>
<p>If design is viewed as a service, third parties make sense, because in a service relationship there is usually a defined beginning and end to an engagement. Clear scope, timeline and deliverables will set this kind of service relationship up for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backbone One, the killer iPhone game pad I </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profiled here late last year</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has just scored the mother of all tie-ups for a gaming accessory. It’s getting bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it launches on iOS today alongside the xCloud game streaming service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of the deal, Backbone is being bundled with Xbox Game Pass in a new retail packaging that gets the Designed for Xbox stamp, making a Backbone + iPhone combo the closest thing we’ve ever seen to a portable Xbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my last piece, I noted how Backbone cleverly used the accessory APIs built into iOS to offer super slick functionality for its cross-game dashboard. It’s been updating that dashboard to get better about showing you games, exposing you to new games and letting you use its clipping features to share killer plays with your friends. It’s one of the best gaming apps I’ve seen on iOS in years, and it has big potential to create a cross-universe place to play for the biggest gaming audience in the world. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capture Button on Backbone One works with Xbox Cloud Gaming and lets you share it as a link. There’s also a new Xbox Game Pass feed and a way to move between Xbox and iOS games in the same interface. There’s also a big callout for Xbox Remote Play, a feature that’s still super under-utilized and actually quite good on current-gen consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package even makes use of an AppClip to display an AR version of Backbone running xCloud for people happening on the retail packaging at a store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Backbone team continues to impress with its slick and clever integrations and solid instincts. The game controller pedigree of the team shows (some original Xbox 360 controller team members worked on Backbone) but the software aspects are the most impressive. The way that Backbone unifies gaming experiences across AAA iOS ports like Warzone or Minecraft, Xbox and Playstation Remote Play and now native xCloud games feels like the way of the future for mobile gaming in a way that none of the individual players, including Apple, has managed to get right. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though xCloud games are web based they are treated and presented as native apps inside Backbone’s really well done dashboard. I’ve personally played a lot of Destiny 2 over Stadia on Backbone and it feels fantastic, I can’t wait for it to be more directly integrated into the dash with clipping and social like the Xbox cloud titles are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of discovering, downloading and playing a game is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Backbone installed than even Apple Arcade now that the team is getting more into curation. They’ve also got a really slick linking mechanism that allows you to download apps right from the App Store if you see a clip of them being shared on your feed. This is how internet native players want to find and play new games &#8212; a continuously hyperlinked world of games and streams that makes it possible to see, follow and play without having to stop to manually search for anything.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also making me yearn for a time when discovering games goes beyond ‘downloading’ them and into a world where I can see a clip shared by a friend, tap on it and be playing a single level or match that gets me hooked before having to go buy the game. It would be a killer acquisition onramp for new players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft tie up means that someone who purchases the Backbone for $99 </span><a href="https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or at Microsoft Stores today gets 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate, making this the absolute best deal for new customers considering GPU is $45 alone. That’s bound to be a huge boost for Backbone as a young gaming startup. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">antitrust suit against Facebook</a> by the FTC and several states had the wind taken out of its sails today by a federal judge, who ruled that the plaintiffs don&#8217;t provide enough evidence that the company exerts monopoly control over social media. The court was more receptive, however, to revisiting the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the case was left open for regulators to take another shot at it.</p>
<p>The court decision was in response to a Facebook motion to dismiss the suit. Judge James Boesberg of the D.C. circuit explained that the provided evidence of monopoly and antitrust violations was &#8220;too speculative and conclusory to go forward.&#8221; In a more ordinary industry, it might have sufficed, he admits, but &#8220;this case involves no ordinary or intuitive market.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was incumbent on the plaintiffs to back up their allegation of Facebook controlling 60 percent of the market with clear and voluminous data and a convincing delineation of what exactly that market comprises — and it failed to do so, wrote Boesberg. Therefore he dismissed the complaints in accordance with Facebook&#8217;s legal argument.</p>
<p>The company wrote in a statement that it is &#8220;pleased that today’s decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Boesberg is sensible that lack of evidence in the record does not mean that the evidence does not exist. So he his giving the FTC and states 30 days to amend their filing, after which the complaints will be reevaluated.</p>

<p>He also found that Facebook&#8217;s logic for dismissing the suit&#8217;s allegations regarding its controversial acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp was lacking.</p>
<p>Facebook argued that even supposing that these acquisitions were somehow problematic, the FTC is not authorized to prosecute such &#8220;long-past conduct&#8221; and is limited to more recent or imminent problems. Boesberg was not convinced, finding precedent that essentially says such mergers are legally considered current as long as they exist, and the government can revisit them any time it thinks it has cause. (That&#8217;s not the case for the state lawsuits, however, which he dismissed outright for coming too long after the fact.)</p>
<p>That may very well be the plan of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">new FTC Chair Lina Khan</a> who has taken a hawkish regulatory position regarding antitrust in general and past acquisitions specifically. At her confirmation hearing she commented that the approvals of the mergers may have been made without complete information and, as such, represented a &#8220;missed opportunity&#8221; to understand and build rules around.</p>
<p>An FTC representative said that &#8220;the FTC is closely reviewing the opinion and assessing the best option forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely know more following the agency&#8217;s meeting on Thursday. The 30-day punt in fact may be a great opportunity for Khan to put her ideas into practice, as the judge practically literally invites them to rewrite the complaint with more information. Whether she and the FTC have enough material to put together a compelling case remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: Facebook should put the champagne back in the fridge, for now at least. Khan may not stop at a slap on the wrist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After raising tens of millions from investors and executing a pretty substantial pivot earlier this year, augmented reality startup Ubiquity6 and its team have been acquired by gaming chat app giant Discord.</p>
<p>The ambitious AR startup had raised $37.5 million from a series of top investors including Benchmark, First Round, Kleiner Perkins and Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures who were betting on its vision of building a consumer-facing platform for hosting augmented reality content. Its most recent publicly disclosed financing was a $27 million Series B in October of 2018.</p>
<p>Terms of the Discord acquisition weren&#8217;t disclosed, though in recent months the startup seemed to abandon most of the products it had spent its first several years building, suggesting that Ubiquity6 had been having some issues finding wide audiences for its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Launching back in 2017, Ubiquity6 hoped to build an app that would be the central way mobile phone users would browse augmented reality content. In late 2019, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ubiquity6s-display-land-is-part-3d-scanner-part-social-network/">launched a product called Displayland</a>, which aimed to gamify the process of 3D scanning physical environments with a smartphone&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s efforts to find mass adoption were hampered by a mobile AR market, which has largely failed to gain any momentum in recent years despite hefty investment from tech giants, including Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In early 2020, CEO Anjney Midha told TechCrunch that the startup had some 65 employees.</p>

<p>In recent months, Ubiquity6 had executed a pretty drastic pivot, leaving augmented reality completely behind in favor of building out a desktop platform that allowed users to play simple online party games together remotely. The beta platform, called <a href="https://backyard.co/sunset">Backyard</a>, was designed for pandemic era habits that seem to be on the decline as the US springs back into action. Backyard was discontinued this week as part of the acquisition announcement.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@ubiquity_6/ubiquity6-discord-3b54cd715943">Medium post</a> announcing the acquisition, Midha seems to downplay any expectations that Ubiquity6&#8217;s augmented reality technology will be living on inside Discord.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at Ubiquity6 has always been to unlock new ways for people to connect through shared experiences,&#8221; Midha wrote. &#8220;Joining Discord today allows us to accelerate that mission — Ubiquity6’s team, Backyard product and multiplayer technology will be integrated into Discord.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The road to entrepreneurship is never easy. The process is stressful and requires a tremendous amount of hustle, risk-taking and comfort with ambiguity. The sacrifices are innumerable, and they sometimes come at the expense of a person’s mental health.</p>
<p>Founders often find themselves in situations where they are under-resourced and overcommitted. While it’s exciting to chase a dream, the weight of responsibility &#8212; to employees, investors and customers &#8212; can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>Compounding this issue is the reluctance many founders have to disclose how they’re feeling to those closest to them for fear that they will be perceived as a “failure” or ill-equipped to perform their job. Imagine for a moment that a founder is struggling with addiction or substance abuse because of the demands and pressures of running their company. Now imagine compounding the worry and anxiety by having to reveal something like this to investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Michael Freeman, a psychiatrist and former CEO who serves on the faculty of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, investigated the prevalence and characteristics of mental health conditions among entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He concluded founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison. Freeman found that entrepreneurs are 50% more likely to report having a mental health condition, with some specific conditions being incredibly prevalent among founders.</p>
<p>The statistics are eye-opening, but the real, tangible impact can be truly devastating.</p>
<p>I say all the time that if I have a sore arm or a sore shoulder, I&#8217;ll come into work and I&#8217;ll whine about it. But if I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night or I&#8217;m paranoid about going outside or I&#8217;ve been taking too many sleeping pills or drinking too much wine, I won&#8217;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say that I&#8217;m going to my doctor to get my shoulder fixed, but I won&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m going to talk to my therapist.</p>
<p>At QED Investors, we experienced the terrible results of this silence firsthand. In 2018, we lost our partner Greg Mazanec after a long battle with substance abuse. Since then, we’ve been working with Greg’s family to determine how we can do our part to prevent others in the VC and startup worlds from suffering the same fate.</p>
<p>I can’t speak highly enough of Greg, both as a personal friend and a colleague. He was the definition of an amazing human being — an orthogonal thinker, tenacious, brilliant, quirky. We lost him far too soon. Today, we carry him around on our shoulders.</p>
<p>We had a team of 15 people at the time, so you can imagine how close everyone was. I swore to myself and to his family that I would talk about him wherever I had the chance. So, whenever I get in front of LPs or my portfolio companies, I bring this issue out into the open to tackle this corrosive stigma head-on.</p>

<p>Taking mental health discussions out of the shadows can massively change the trajectory of outcomes. Our world of venture capital is replete with people who are going through these kinds of difficulties, even before the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated people’s fears and worries. People have felt increasingly isolated, depressed, anxious and helpless. Some may have turned to opioids or another form of addiction or substance misuse.</p>
<p>The research is clear &#8212; support from friends, peers and colleagues is pivotal in conquering mental illness. As companies start returning to the office or adopting a home-office hybrid, organizations have a real chance to refocus their company cultures, destigmatize addiction and make mental wellness a priority. This is a unique window to focus on this disease.</p>
<p>The Mazanec family created <a href="https://theoperationlighthouse.org/">Operation Lighthouse</a> to address substance abuse and addiction in the ecosystem most dear to Greg &#8212; the founder and entrepreneur community. It was the easiest of decisions for QED to lean in heavily to support this wonderful initiative.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, QED piloted a program called Just Five with three of our portfolio companies. Created by national mental health nonprofit <a href="https://www.shatterproof.org/">Shatterproof</a>, <a href="https://justfive.org/">Just Five</a> delivers, in 5 minutes per lesson, the most important concepts and facts regarding addiction.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to roll out that same self-paced and anonymous educational program free of charge to more than 16,000 employees across all 50 of QED’s U.S.-based portfolio companies.</p>
<p>This program’s intent is to provide mental health education and catalyze informed discussion to ultimately reduce stigma.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, we intend to expand the reach of this program to our international portfolio companies, as well as to other VCs who might wish to support their founders. A Spanish-language version is already planned.</p>
<p>Each of the six lessons has a specific theme. The first two lessons touch on the science of addiction and how certain factors such as age of first use, genetics and environment can explain why some people become addicted and others do not.</p>
<p>The middle lessons explain the dangers of opioids and the signs, symptoms and treatment options for substance abuse, while the final topics touch on ways people can help. The majority of the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received so far has been centered around those final two lessons. We learned something that we anecdotally already knew &#8212; people want to help, but those who need help the most don’t always know how to ask for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken every opportunity I’ve had to discuss mental health over the past few years. I truly believe that if you destigmatize it, people can deal with it. It’s a solvable problem. Just like your sore shoulder, it can be fixed. We just have to do a better job at creating a culture where people can take the first step and speak openly about it.</p>
<p>We can — we <em>must</em> — make a difference. Have your voice join mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/opening-an-office-in-lagos-nigeria/">announced</a> it was opening an office in Lagos, Nigeria, which would provide the company with a hub in the region and the first office on the continent staffed with a team of engineers. We&#8217;ve now spotted one of the first products to emerge from this office: an education-focused mobile app called Sabee, which means &#8220;to know&#8221; in Nigerian Pidgin. The app aims to connect learners and educators in online communities to make educational opportunities more accessible.</p>
<p>The app was briefly published to Google Play by &#8220;NPE Team,&#8221; the internal R&amp;D group at Facebook, which has typically focused on new social experiences in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-tests-video-speed-dating-events-with-sparked/">dating</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">audio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">music</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">video</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/facebook-launches-an-experimental-app-for-messaging-close-friends-over-apple-watch/">messaging </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">more</a>.</p>
<p>While the learnings from the NPE Team&#8217;s apps sometimes inform broader Facebook efforts, the group hasn&#8217;t yet produced an app that has graduated to become a standalone Facebook product. Many of its earlier apps have also shut down, including (<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/egg-is-facebooks-one-good-product-it-doesnt-deserve-to-die">somewhat sadly</a>), the online zine creator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">Eg.g</a>, video app<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/"> Hobbi</a>, calling app CatchUp, friend-finder Bump, podcast community app Venue, and several others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sabee, however, represents a new direction for the NPE Team, as it&#8217;s not about building yet another social experiment.</p>
<p>Instead, Sabee is tied to Facebook&#8217;s larger strategy of focusing more on serving the African continent, starting with Nigeria. This is a strategic move, informed by <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/urban-population-to-become-the-new-majority-worldwide/">data</a> that indicates a larger majority of the world&#8217;s population will be in urban centers by 2030, and much of that will be on the African continent and throughout the Middle East. By 2100, Africa&#8217;s population is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1905838/facebook-to-open-africa-office-in-lagos-nigeria-in-2021/">expected to have tripled</a>, with Nigeria becoming the second-most populated country in the world, behind China.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171015" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171015" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>To address the need to connect these regions to the internet, Facebook teamed with telcos on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/2africa-africa-middle-east-facebook-subsea-cable/">2Africa, a subsea cable project</a> that aims to serve the over 1 billion people still offline in Africa and the Middle East. These aren&#8217;t altruistic investments, of course &#8212; Facebook knows its future growth will come from these demographics.</p>
<p>Facebook confirmed its plans for Sabee to TechCrunch after we discovered it, noting it was still a small test for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 million learners, but only 2 million educators in Nigeria,&#8221; said Facebook Product Lead, Emeka Okafor. &#8220;With this small, early test, we’re hoping to understand how we can help educators build communities that make education available to everyone. We look forward to learning with our early testers, and deciding what to do from there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171010" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171010" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>The disparity between learners and educators in Nigeria greatly impacts women and girls, which is another key focus for Sabee &#8212; and the NPE Team&#8217;s efforts in the region as a whole. The company also wants to explore how to better serve groups who are often left behind by technology. On this front, Sabee is working to create an experience that works with low connectivity, like 2G.</p>
<p>We understand the app is currently in early alpha testing with fewer than 100 testers who are under NDA agreements with Facebook. It&#8217;s not available for anyone else beyond that group at present, but the company hopes to scale Sabee to the next stage before the end of the year.</p>
<p>There is no way to sign up for a Sabee waitlist, and the app is no longer public on Google Play. It was available so briefly that it was never ranked on any charts, app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower confirmed to us.</p>
<p>We should note that &#8220;sabee&#8221; and &#8220;sabi/sabis&#8221; have other, less-polite meanings in different languages, per Urban Dictionary. But the team has no plans to change the name for now as it makes sense in the Nigerian market where the app is targeted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://pod.link/found">Found</a>, we speak to Rob Schutz, co-founder and Chief Growth Officer at Ro. Ro recently raised $500 million, bringing its total raised to date to near $1 billion. The digital healthcare startup now does everything from telehealth primary care, to operating physical pharmacies, but it originally began life as Roman, a startup addressing men&#8217;s health and, specifically, erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Rob told us how a windy path from founding a daily deals site in the heady times of Groupon, to teaching at General Assembly, and being an early employee at Bark Box (now just &#8216;Bark&#8217;) led him to meeting up with co-founders Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian and setting up Roman in the first place. He also detailed how the company evolved, first to address women&#8217;s health, as well, and eventually to providing much more broad-reaching remote primary care.</p>
<p>We talked about everything from managing the dynamics in a founder triumvirate (including declarations of love), to dealing with the ongoing complications of a rebrand, to operating a business in an industry with dense regulatory requirements that vary considerably state to state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Rob, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Yes, developers are a tough crowd. They hate being sold to, and it’s pretty easy for traditional marketing campaigns to fall flat with them because they’d much rather get a recommendation from a colleague. Failed campaign after failed campaign has led many software company executives to throw up their hands and declare all sales and marketing to be pointless.</p>
<p>And that’s just wrong. Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult. I cover <em>why</em> it’s difficult and offer examples of exceptional developer-focused marketing in <a href="http://offers.openviewpartners.com/developerfocusedgtmplaybook">my new playbook</a>. Part of selling to developers involves balancing two things: building out a strong organic marketing function and targeting your audience with the right message at the right time throughout their buyer journey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right?</p>
<p>Yep. I see it all the time. Part of what’s blocking marketers from widening the top of the funnel (driving more developers to sign up for their free tools) for their developer-focused businesses is ensuring they have the right data and measurement capabilities in place to understand how much impact their activities have on the business.</p>
<p>That’s mostly because these marketers, community managers and developer relations experts have the most luck with organic marketing. In this industry, organic marketing is one of the most challenging to measure.</p>
<p>Organic marketing means investing in channels like referrals, organic search, organic social (community) and direct traffic to your website (brand). New users from paid marketing, banner ads, events or sales reps (the most measurable channels) don’t count as organic. We measure the fruits of these efforts with a new metric called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a>.</p>
<p>In a digital, multi-touch-point world, it’s getting more challenging to measure which users hear about your brand from which channels. That’s why tools like <a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, <a href="https://tribe.so/">Tribe</a> and <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty</a> have gained traction so quickly.</p>
<p>That’s all good, and it’ll be a huge boon for community managers in time, but these tools still don’t solve some of the core data strategy issues I see developer-focused software companies fighting. These quick tips should help your team align around what needs to be done and what&#8217;s just a “nice to have” so that selling to developers feels less like a battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat data like a product where a core end user is the go-to-market side of the team.</li>
<li>Map your customer’s journey from discovery to expansion and track it religiously.</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LocoNav, an India-based startup that is helping drivers and fleet owners in over two-dozen nations run their vehicles more efficiently and save money, said on Monday it has raised $37 million in a new financing round.</p>
<p>Five-year-old LocoNav&#8217;s new financing round, a Series B, was funded by Quiet Capital, Anthemis Group, Foundamental, Sequoia Capital India, RIT Capital Partners, Uncorrelated Ventures, Village Global and others. The new financing round brings the to-date raise of LocoNav, which has offices in San Francisco and Gurgaon, to $47 million.</p>
<p>Scores of high-profile tech executives, including Anjali Joshi (ex-VP of Product at Google), Anand Chandrasekaran (ex-CPO at SnapDeal and ex-Director Facebook), Manik Gupta (ex-CPO at Uber), Jai Shekhawat, Mark Licht, Akhil Paul, Vas Bhandarkar, Ajay Agarwal (Partner at Bain Capital Ventures), Abhi Ingle (COO at Qualtrics), Aadil Mamujee, also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over half a million vehicle and fleet owners in 25 nations use LocoNav’s platform today, which uses AI to help them manage their fleet operations, keep a watch on performance, and improve efficiency, the startup’s founders Shridhar Gupta and Vidit Jain told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup’s platform delivers assistance and recommendations to drivers to make better choices. <a href="https://loconav.com">LocoNav</a> also enables customers to track fuel usage, and any potential theft. Its platform supports over a thousand devices and sensors, enabling it to onboard new customers very quickly.</p>
<p>The founders said that the market in which they operate has become very large over the past decade as many drivers and fleet owners begin to engage with tech platforms. Some of the players operating in this space include unicorns and decacorns Fleetcor, Trimble and a16z-backed Samsara.</p>
<p>But these players are largely operating in developed markets, which has allowed LocoNav to win customers in emerging nations, the founders said. “In global developing markets, no one has ambitiously built a large player and we see ourselves as the first mover there,” said Gupta. The founders added that the biggest roadblock in the industry remains drivers and fleet owners who are not using any tech.</p>
<p>“LocoNav has built an end-to-end product that becomes deeply embedded in how fleet owners and operators run their business. As a result, LocoNav has been able to scale rapidly through word of mouth, allowing the company to become a hyper growth market leader while also being very capital efficient,” said David Greenbaum, Partner at Quiet Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>By having such deep visibility into a vehicle, LocoNav has also become very attractive to a range of firms &#8212; from app-based cab aggregators, car vendors to fintech startups and sensor manufacturers, said Jain. The startup is also using its data insights to develop customer-relevant services and bringing them to a single platform, he added.</p>
<p>LocoNav plans to deploy the fresh capital to hire data science teams across San Francisco, Gurgaon and Bangalore. In the next two years, the startup aims to broaden its product offerings to help fleet owners cut their costs by up to 50%, the founders said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shridhar and Vidit have found the ideal playbook for delivering world-class value-added services and products to fleet owners across the globe through the use of AI and software solutions. We are thrilled at how rapidly the firm has been able to expand its global footprint by replicating its own model and suite of offerings for fleet owners,&#8221; said Shubhankar Bhattacharya, General Partner at Foundamental, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung’s Mobile World Congress presser was, once again, all about wearables. The big news at this evening’s (or afternoon’s, timezone dependent) event was <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/&amp;reserved=0">our best look yet at a redesigned interface</a> for the company’s line of Galaxy Watches.</p>
<p>One UI Watch – which takes its name from the Galaxy mobile interface &#8212; will share a design language with the one found on the company’s line of Galaxy phones. The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170930" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170930" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-Seamless-Experience.2021-06-28-11_56_37.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/"> first teased at I/O last month</a> that the two technology powerhouses would be teaming up on a wearables project. We still have little in the way of information about it, however, – including what it will actually be called.</p>
<p>The partnership was initially announced as a “unified platform” that would allow developers to create a single app for both Google’s Wear OS and Tizen, the open-source operating system Samsung has long relied on for its own smartwatches. As we noted at the time, third-party app development has proven a considerable hurdle for both companies as they look to take on Apple’s dominance of the space.</p>
<p>Among the benefits of the partnerships is that once a watch-compatible app has been downloaded on a connected smartphone, it will also be downloaded to the watch. Along with first-party Google apps like Maps and YouTube Music, the list includes Spotify (naturally), Calm, Strava, Adidas Running and Sleep Cycle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said in a release tied to the news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance, and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>Such a partnership seems odd at first blush – Samsung long ago eschewed Google’s wearable operating system in favor of its own heavily customized version of Tizen. Ultimately, however, it seems the two are united against the monolith that is Apple – which currently enjoys somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of the global market. Samsung is in second, but even with Fitbit under its wing, Google’s still got a ways to go.</p>
<p>Samsung will also be showing off improved development tools that make it easier to create things like watch faces for the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today released the first preview build of Windows 11 to those in the Dev Channel of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/">Windows Insider</a> program. If you have joined the Insider program and meet Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">new &#8212; and somewhat complicated &#8212; system requirements</a> for the new operating system, you should see the update soon.</p>
<p>This first preview includes most of the new features Microsoft has promised for Windows 11, including the new look and feel, themes, widgets, the new snap layouts and the updated File Explorer. But there are also some features that didn&#8217;t yet make the cut for this first release. Support for Android apps and the new built-in Teams integration, for example, are coming in a later release, but a preview of the new Windows Store is already available today.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otherwise, though, you&#8217;ll get to try out the new Start menu for example (and fret not, you will be able to move the start button to the bottom-left if you don&#8217;t like the centered look &#8212; but you won&#8217;t be able to move the entire taskbar to another side of the screen). And while the Start menu is an iconic part of the Windows experience, most power users probably never use it and instead use their keyboard or the taskbar to start 99% of their applications. Still, Microsoft is trying to do something different here with its new &#8220;recommended&#8221; section that highlights newly installed apps and recently used files.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170667" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170667" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg" alt="windows 11 file explorer" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature you&#8217;ll likely spot right away is the new File Explorer, which now does away with the ribbon-style menu in favor of a flatter look (Microsoft calls it a &#8216;command bar&#8217;) and new, more modern icons across the board. It looks good, but we&#8217;ll have to give it a try to see if it hasn&#8217;t lost a lot of functionality in the process.</p>
<p>The File Explorer, just like every other app in WIndows 11, will also feature support for Microsoft&#8217;s new Snap layouts, which take the existing &#8216;snapping&#8217; gesture or keyboard shortcuts in Windows that let you snap windows to any side of the screen and brings it to the maximize button. While the overall functionality isn&#8217;t new here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of Windows users never knew it existed, so this new feature will introduce window snapping to a lot more users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170668" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170668" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg" alt="Windows 11 widgets" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg 1531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new widgets, too, are now prominently highlighted in the taskbar. Right now, there are calendar, weather, local traffic, Microsoft To Do and stocks widgets, as well widgets that show you recent photos from OneDrive and sports and esports news if that&#8217;s your thing. There&#8217;s also a personalized news feed.</p>
<p>The last new feature worth mentioning here is the new Settings menu. Ever since the ill-fated Windows 8, Windows essentially had two settings menus (the Control Panel and Settings). It looks like those confusing days aren&#8217;t over just yet, but the new Settings menu at least looks a lot cleaner than the existing one in Windows 10.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170669" style="width: 1545px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170669" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170669 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg" alt="windows 11 settings" width="1535" height="1020" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1535px) 100vw, 1535px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170669" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of other changes in Windows 11. This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes. Now we&#8217;ll just have to see how all of this works in the real world &#8212; though keep in mind that this is still an early release. The preview is now rolling out to Insiders, so we&#8217;ll likely hear more about how it performs soon. We&#8217;ll also put it through its paces in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The math is simple: Great research universities beget great startups. Pittsburgh certainly has little want for the former, with two world-class research schools &#8212; Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh – located in the city.</p>
<p>The latter historically presented a challenge for Pittsburgh, as local startups often left for the greener (in the sense of dollars) pastures of vibrant ecosystems like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">speaking to current mayor Bill Peduto</a> about how Pittsburgh is working to build its own startup community, I hopped on a call with Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of CMU’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. The Center – named for Accel founder Jim Swartz – is tasked with helping grow the student body’s entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>

<p>This interview is part of TechCrunch’s City Spotlight on Pittsburgh. Join us on Tuesday, June 29 for the free online event where we will be joined by Mayor Peduto, Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo, and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Can you give me a bit of a brief history on how CMU has developed startups over the years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dave Mawhinney</strong>: First of all, I’m a CMU alum – and I’m not your typical academic. I had a 30-year entrepreneurial and venture capital career before I came back to Carnegie Mellon a decade ago to make it on-par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities[…] When I came back to CMU in 2011, 2012, there were several different activities across campus that were rather siloed.</p>
<p>There was an effort in the computer science department, there was an effort in the engineering department, there was an effort in the business school and they were all doing their own things and not necessarily getting the economies of scale of working together. When the university asked me to come back and run the Don Jones Center at the business school, I said I would only do so if you give me the agency to try to pull together all of our entrepreneurial activities under one rough.</p>
<p><strong>You can create a really breakthrough technology, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got the ability to market it yourself to create an effective business plan. How much is that built into the curriculum at CMU? And how much cross pollination is there between the various departments?</strong></p>
<p>We have a sign at our front door that says, “the ideal startup team is hacker, hustler, designer.” The hackers are the technical people, the hustlers are the people that are willing to do business, to talk to partners. And I think designers are absolutely key because they are the glue that holds everything together. They make the products and services useable. It’s truly in our DNA and as we do our education in the four-credit classes, or as we do our workshops that are outside the classroom, that concept of design thinking, really getting to know your customer and solving real world problems that they’re willing to pay for now, is critical to getting the company off to the right start.</p>
<p>We also very much believe in the model of mentorship, so all of our startups get assigned mentors that are from the generalized background of the business that they’re going into. And then we have a roster of several hundred experts, from legal experts, accounting experts, marketing experts, manufacturing experts &#8212; any type of expertise that you can imagine that our teams can reach out to and tap into, to get questions answered and to get set on the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of vetting happens on the university side? Does a startup have to pass a certain threshold to gain access to all of these opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody’s welcome. Our doors are open to everybody, but there are some steps. When you come and sign up to work at the Swartz Center, you get to go to a first come, first serve table. There’s typically 20 of these tables available at any given time. The teams that show dedication, they participate in our programs, they’re showing up on a daily and weekly basis and they’re making progress, they’ll get a dedicated table, where they get to put their branding on the table and keep their equipment there. And the, ultimately, the teams that are making the most progress have customers and perhaps have raised a pre-seed or seed round, they get their own office. We have ten of those called “Startup Garages.” We do have that bit of meritocracy built in, as you go forward, but it is open to everybody. The truth is the founding teams, the entrepreneurs, they have to make it happen. We’re not going to spoon feed you.</p>
<p><strong>Like a lot of other schools located outside of major metropolitan areas, I assume there’s a lot of bleed when it comes to leaving for different markets.</strong></p>
<p>That has been true historically, but it’s changed. Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees. Every major tech company &#8212; Amazon, Facebook, Apple &#8212; have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon – and that sort of set off the robot revolution […] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.</p>
<p>But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community. If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora – collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million. So we do need to keep that connectivity to the money centers in the Bay Area and New York to ensure that our startups will get funded.</p>
