										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The aviation industry is notoriously difficult to decarbonize, in part because airplanes use a petroleum-based fuel to fly.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels wants to change that. The new cleantech company, headed by Bryan Sherbacow, is developing a low-carbon jet fuel that can be used as a 100 percent drop-in replacement for petroleum fuel, without needing to adapt existing aircraft or engines. That&#8217;s notable because the only commercially available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) still requires a 50-50 blend with conventional fuel.</p>
<p>The technology has piqued the interest of the aviation industry. Alder Fuels said Thursday it has inked a multi-million dollar investment from aviation giants United and Honeywell – as well as a purchase agreement from United for 1.5 billion gallons of fuel, the largest known agreement for SAF in aviation history.</p>
<p>United consumes around 4 billion gallons of fuel per year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, so the purchase agreement would account for nearly 40% of the airlines overall annual fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Before the fuel starts powering United airplanes, it must meet specifications outlined by ASTM International, an international organization that sets the standards for a wide range of materials and products. From there, Alder and Honeywell expect to commercialize the technology by 2025.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels was formally launched earlier this year, but Sherbacow has been assessing the technology for around five years, he said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. It became clear through his previous work that the technology behind the low-carbon fuel – and especially the raw materials – needed to be scalable and widely available.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re all looking for is […] how do you access these carbon oil precursors, and efficiently convert them into something that works within the existing refining infrastructure?” Sherbacow said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To solve that problem, he’s turned to carbon-rich woody biomass, like agricultural waste, which is turned into crude oil that can be used to make aviation fuel. The company uses a pyrolysis-based technology that transforms the biomass into a liquid and treats it in such a way that it can be put into existing refineries. Alder Fuels will initially use Honeywell’s proprietary “Ecofining” hydroprocessing technology. The ultimate aim is to make the new fuel compatible with all refining assets.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s significant amount of [woody biomass] that&#8217;s already industrially aggregated, but has either no or very low economic value today,” Sherbacow explained. “But it’s a great opportunity for us because it&#8217;s a store of carbon that we can utilize.” It could even open up new markets for companies in forestry, agriculture, and even the paper industry, which are already generating plenty of bio-waste.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels&#8217; research is supported by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Energy, and Sherbacow stressed the importance of public-private partnerships to decarbonizing the aviation industry. Climate change has been of particular interest to President Joe Biden’s administration, and incentives for sustainable aviation fuel will likely end up in the $3.5 trillion spending bill currently being debated by Congress.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s one of the roles of government, is to help the transition,” he said. “You need to incentivize the incumbents to change their behavior, or they&#8217;re going to resist a disruptive change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has extended a shutdown at its Orion Assembly Plant another two weeks due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV safety recall.</p>
<p>GM said the extended downtime at the Orion plant will last through September 20. Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan has been shut down since August 23.</p>
<p>The recall, which now includes all Chevy Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017, was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects in the battery cell that could increase the risk of fire. The possible fire risk prompted GM to recommend Bolt owners set the vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of range. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/">recommends</a> Bolt drivers park their vehicles away from their homes to reduce fire risk.</p>
<p>The automaker said it is working with its supplier LG Chem to &#8220;update manufacturing processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orion was initially shuttered in August because of a shortage of semiconductor chips. GM later notified employees that the plant would continue to be down because of a shortage of batteries related to the recall.</p>
<p>The recall is expected to cost GM $1.8 billion. A GM spokesperson did not provide an update on whether this extended downtime would push that number higher. The automaker has said it will seek reimbursement from LG Chem.</p>
<h2>Chip shortages</h2>
<p>While the global shortage of semiconductor chips has persisted, GM said it will be able to resume production at several of its plants over the next two weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Full production will begin at its Fort Wayne Assembly and Silao Assembly plants, which produces the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 models, beginning September 13 after being briefly impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, GM said.</p>
<p>All of GM’s full-size truck and full-size SUV plants in North American will be running full production next week.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee will resume production of the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5 and XT6 on September 20, after being shuttered since mid-July. That plant will be shut down again as part of a previously scheduled extended downtime beginning the week of September 27 through the week of November 22 for new-model tooling installation.</p>
<p>Cadillac XT4 production, which has been down since February 8, will resume at the Fairfax Assembly in Kansas. GM said production of the Chevrolet Malibu, which is also at Fairfax, will remain down.</p>
<p>The company extended downtimes by one week at Lansing Delta Township and Wentzville, along with an additional week of Chevrolet Blazer production downtime at its Ramos facility.</p>

		<a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/siegfried-glenzer">Siegfried Glenzer</a>, a recipient of the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, is a professor and high-energy-density division director at Stanford’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a science adviser for nuclear fusion company <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The quest to make fusion power a reality recently took a massive step forward. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/breakthrough-laser-powered-fusion-experiment-nears-ignition/">The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the results</a> of an experiment with an unprecedented high fusion yield. A single laser shot initiated reactions that released 1.3 megajoules of fusion yield energy with signatures of propagating nuclear burn.</p>
<p>Reaching this milestone indicates just how close fusion actually is to achieving power production. The latest results demonstrate the rapid pace of progress — especially as lasers are evolving at breathtaking speed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the laser is one of the most impactful technological inventions since the end of World War II. Finding widespread use in an incredibly diverse range of applications — including machining, precision surgery and consumer electronics — lasers are an essential part of everyday life. Few know, however, that lasers are also heralding an exciting and entirely new chapter in physics: enabling controlled nuclear fusion with positive energy gain.</p>
<p>After six decades of innovation, lasers are now assisting us in the urgent process of developing clean, dense and efficient fuels, which, in turn, are needed to help solve the world’s energy crisis through large-scale decarbonized energy production. The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased every decade by a factor of 1,000.</p>
<p>Physicists recently conducted a fusion experiment that produced 1,500 terawatts of power. For a short period of time, this generated four to five times more energy than what the whole world consumes at a given moment. In other words, we are already able to produce vast amounts of power. Now we also need to produce vast amounts of energy so as to offset the energy expended to drive the igniting lasers.</p>
<p>Beyond lasers, there are also considerable advances on the target side. The recent use of nanostructure targets allows for more efficient absorption of laser energies and ignition of the fuel. This has only been possible for a few years, but here, too, technological innovation is on a steep incline with tremendous advancement from year to year.</p>
<p>In the face of such progress, you may wonder what is still holding us back from making commercial fusion a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There remain two significant challenges: First, we need to bring the pieces together and create an integrated process that satisfies all the physical and technoeconomic requirements. Second, we require sustainable levels of investment from private and public sources to do so. Generally speaking, the field of fusion is woefully underfunded. This is shocking given the potential of fusion, especially in comparison to other energy technologies.</p>
<p>Investments in clean energy amounted to more than <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transition-investment-hit-500-billion-in-2020-for-first-time/">$500 billion in 2020</a>. The funds that go into fusion research and development are only a fraction of that. There are countless brilliant scientists working in the sector already, as well as eager students wishing to enter the field. And, of course, we have excellent government research labs. Collectively, researchers and students believe in the power and potential of controlled nuclear fusion. We should ensure financial support for their work to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>What we need now is an expansion of public and private investment that does justice to the opportunity at hand. Such investments may have a longer time horizon, but their eventual impact is without parallel. I believe that net-energy gain is within reach in the next decade; commercialization, based on early prototypes, will follow in very short order.</p>
<p>But such timelines are heavily dependent on funding and the availability of resources. Considerable investment is being allocated to alternative energy sources — wind, solar, etc. — but fusion must have a place in the global energy equation. This is especially true as we approach the critical breakthrough moment.</p>
<p>If laser-driven nuclear fusion is perfected and commercialized, it has the potential to become the energy source of choice, displacing the many existing, less ideal energy sources. This is because fusion, if done correctly, offers energy that is in equal parts clean, safe and affordable. I am convinced that fusion power plants will eventually replace most conventional power plants and related large-scale energy infrastructure that are still so dominant today. There will be no need for coal or gas.</p>
<p>The ongoing optimization of the fusion process, which results in higher yields and lower costs, promises energy production at much below the current price point. At the limit, this corresponds to a source of unlimited energy. If you have unlimited energy, then you also have unlimited possibilities. What can you do with it? I foresee reversing climate change by taking out the carbon dioxide we have put into the atmosphere over the last 150 years.</p>
<p>With a future empowered by fusion technology, you would also be able to use energy to desalinate water, creating unlimited water resources that would have an enormous impact in arid and desert regions. All in all, fusion enables better societies, keeping them sustainable and clean rather than dependent on destructive, dirty energy sources and related infrastructures.</p>
<p>Through years of dedicated research at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility, I was privileged to witness and lead the first inertial confinement fusion experiments. I saw the seed of something remarkable being planted and taking root. I have never been more excited than I am now to see the fruits of laser technology harvested for the empowerment and advancement of humankind.</p>
<p>My fellow scientists and students are committed to moving fusion from the realm of tangibility into that of reality, but this will require a level of trust and help. A small investment today will have a big impact toward providing a much needed, more welcome energy alternative in the global arena.</p>
<p>I am betting on the side of optimism and science, and I hope that others will have the courage to do so, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://supabase.io">Supabase</a>, the backend-as-a-service startup, announced this week that it raised a $30 million Series A.</p>
<p>Supabase is often described as an open source alternative to Google&#8217;s Firebase &#8230; which is a pretty good way to put it for those who know what Firebase is. For those who don&#8217;t: Supabase is a collection of tools that helps developers build projects more quickly by automatically handling a whole lot of the behind-the-scenes work and wiring.</p>
<p>Create a project, and Supabase will give you a Postgres database; an API for interacting with said database that automatically evolves (and documents itself!) as your database changes; a user authentication system that plays friendly with the popular login providers (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etc.); a storage system for handling things like image and video uploads; and a UI for overseeing and managing it all. It takes a bunch of work you&#8217;d need to do to build just about any modern app or service and waves it away with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>Supabase is free for hobby projects (or when you just want to tinker with it). Once you start needing bigger databases or data backups, the price scales starting at $25 per project per month. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting">deploy it yourself</a>, though that&#8217;s a bit tougher and currently means losing the management UI.</p>
<p>This Series A comes pretty quickly following the company&#8217;s last raise — a $6 million round announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative/">in December 2020</a>. I&#8217;m told this round was funded predominantly by Coatue, with some of it reserved for a few new key angel investors, including GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, PagerDuty co-founder Alex Solomon and Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes.</p>
<p>Supabase co-founder Paul Copplestone tells me that the team is now made up of 24 people, distributed all over the world. &#8220;We were born remote,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This reasoning is twofold: The company started growing just as the pandemic began to spread, and it&#8217;s largely hiring people who are already working on and contributing to the tools that make Supabase possible. Why make them move around the world when they&#8217;re already doing a good job?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We use, I think, six different tools,&#8221; Copplestone said. &#8220;And we employ lead maintainers of several of those tools. We employ open source contributors, anyone who&#8217;s contributing, no matter where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supabase was part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 class, the accelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">first cohort to be entirely remote.</a> Meanwhile, YC classes are growing increasingly large; the S20 batch, for example, came in at over 200 companies. It can be hard to stand out in a group like that, but Supabase seemed to do it — I was hearing chatter about them early and often.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like to fire up a Supabase backend:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement," has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plentywaka wants to change the way Africans move. It&#8217;s starting with one of the busiest cities on the continent.</p>
<p>The startup, a ride-share and bus-booking platform, is based in Lagos, the Nigerian city where 20 million people and <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/carte-des-projets/improve-public-transport-lagos-metropolitan-area">45% of the country&#8217;s skilled workforce</a> live. The public transportation system strains under the weight of 14 million commuters who use it daily.</p>
<p>Relying on the public bus can be more than unpredictable — it also can be dangerous, according to Onyeka Akumah, co-founder and CEO of Plentywaka. The buses are often old, in disrepair and packed beyond safe limits; traffic congestion turns what should be a 30-minute commute into a three-hour journey.</p>
<p>Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement,&#8221; was founded in 2019. While it&#8217;s still young, the startup has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Plentywaka has two models. “Daily Waka” offers riders in a city fixed daily routes from bus stop to bus stop. Riders can view the schedule of buses, how many seats are available and reserve seats via the app, which tracks the movements of SUVs, minivans, vans and buses driven by gig workers, also known as “heroes.” When the bus arrives, riders can check in with a QR code, and when they hop off, the app automatically charges the rider via a wallet system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel Waka&#8221; is a newer model that offers interstate travel. It basically serves as a booking engine for other bus companies that offer city-to-city services.</p>
<p>In March this year, Plentywaka was accepted into the Techstars Toronto accelerator program, securing funding as it looks toward global expansion across Africa and into Canada. Just this month, the company also announced expansion plans into Ghana via an acquisition of Star Bus.</p>
<p>Akumah talks us through what the TechStars funding means to Plentywaka, the startup landscape in Africa and tips for African startups looking for investors.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><strong>Before founding Plentywaka, you were the CEO of Farmcrowdy, another startup that connected investors to farmers via a digital platform. What was the impetus for starting a second business? Are you a serial entrepreneur, or do you plan on sticking with this one?</strong></p>
<p>I was the CEO of Farmcrowdy until the end of May this year, but I&#8217;ve handed it over to my other co-founder who is now the CEO, so I&#8217;m fully focused on Plentywaka now. We started Plentywaka in January 2019. I was flying back from Qatar, where I spoke at an event, and landed in Lagos around 8:15 a.m. that day. I had to be at a meeting by 10 a.m., and going through traffic in Lagos is a pain. The state has 20 million people and everybody&#8217;s rushing to work, so I had to abandon my car and take two bikes to make that meeting. When that was done, to make another meeting, I had to take a boat ride across the lagoon. I tweeted about it saying, &#8220;Today, I have flown, I have used two bikes and now I&#8217;m on a boat ride. This is the life of an entrepreneur in Lagos.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was the shock my colleagues gave me when they said we should experiment with taking the bus. I hadn&#8217;t taken the bus in about 15 years, and I took that trip and had a panic attack. I never knew how frightened I would be getting on a 30-year-old bus with torn-out parts and worn-out chairs. I literally had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off. That was the day the concept of Plentywaka started.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku&#8217;s expansion into original content continues with news that the streaming platform and device maker will debut its first original feature-length film during the 2021 holiday season. In partnership with Lionsgate, Roku announced it will introduce a movie based on the Emmy-winning TV series &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Playlist,&#8221; which will air on its free streaming hub, The Roku Channel later this year.</p>
<p>The new movie, &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Christmas,&#8221; will continue where the series left off following its season 2 finale and series cancellation, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2569985/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-cast-options-expired-fans-upset-jane-levy">had upset fans</a> who had taken to social media in hopes of saving the show by finding it a new home. Roku, as it turns out, is that home &#8212; not only will it air the new film, it will also make all 25 episodes of the series available to stream for free on The Roku Channel in the U.S. later this fall.</p>
<p>The feature film, meanwhile, begins production this month in Vancouver, and will see a number of actors reprising their roles, including Jane Levy, Skylar Astin, Alex Newell, John Clarence Stewart, Andrew Leeds, Alice Lee, Michael Thomas Grant, Kapil Talwalkar, David St. Louis, Mary Steenburgen, Peter Gallagher, and Bernadette Peters. Details of the film&#8217;s plot are still limited, however, noting only that it will be a continuation of Zoey&#8217;s journey as she &#8220;navigates work, family, love and everything in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>While a significant move for fans who simply wanted more of their favorite show, it&#8217;s a bigger step forward for Roku and its original content strategy. The company had already tested consumers&#8217; appetite for original series by acquiring the content catalog from the short-lived streaming service Quibi earlier this year, whose shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">then launched to The Roku Channel</a> as the company&#8217;s first set of Roku Originals. The debut lineup included 30 titles, but Roku is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/quibis-content-is-coming-to-roku-as-roku-originals-will-kick-off-rokus-investment-in-original-content/">continuing</a> to roll out more shows as the year progresses. Last month, for instance, it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/roku-adds-23-more-quibi-shows-as-it-pursues-original-content-strategy.html">released</a> 23 more of those shows to its collection.  The company also recently decided to reinvest in at least one previously Quibi-owned series by greenlighting a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/roku-most-dangerous-game-renewed-season-2-1235000929/">second season of &#8220;Most Dangerous Game.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>But until now, Roku has not invested in full-length movies.</p>
<p>Movies make a good fit for The Roku Channel, of course, as the free streaming is supported by advertising &#8212; and movies, due to their length, offer more ad slots to be filled. In fact, The Roku Channel got its start as free movies hub, before later expanding to include TV shows and other types of content, like news and sports.</p>
<p>So far, Roku&#8217;s original programming seems to be connecting with viewers. The company says its top 5 streamed TV shows this summer (May 20-July 18) were all Roku Originals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new film is produced by Lionsgate in association with the Tannenbaum Company, Feigco Entertainment, and Universal Music Group’s Polygram Entertainment and Zihuatenejo Productions. The series creator Austin Winsberg will write and executive produce. Richard Shepard, who filmed the show&#8217;s pilot, will direct. Kim Tannenbaum, Eric Tannenbaum, Paul Feig, David Blackman, and Daniel Inkeles will also serve as executive producers.</p>
<p>The movie will air on The Roku Channel during the holidays in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford has hired six senior-level executives to its newly minted commercial vehicles and services business unit as the automaker prepares to bring to market the E-Transit cargo van and the F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck  — two electric vehicles it&#8217;s betting will become commercial customers&#8217; new workhorses.</p>
<p>Ford pulled from within its ranks and outside the company to fill out the leadership team for the new business unit, Ford Pro. Among the new hires is Muffi Ghadiali, the CEO of Electriphi, the battery management and fleet monitoring software startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">Ford acquired in June</a>. Ghadiali will continue to serve in his role with Electriphi and head up Ford Pro&#8217;s charging department.</p>
<p>Ford also hired Tim Baughman, Ford&#8217;s former controller for U.S. marketing, sales and service, to be the general manager of Ford Pro North America. Ford Pro&#8217;s new CFO will be Navin Kumar, who was previously at Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC.</p>
<p>Tracey Pass, who comes from The Walt Disney Company, has been hired as the chief human resources officer, and Rahul Singh, who was head of software development for Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, is the unit&#8217;s CTO. Wanda Young, chief marketing officer of Samsung Electronics America, has taken a similar position at Ford Pro.</p>
<p>Ford previously announced that Hans Schep will be the general manager of Ford Pro Europe.</p>
<p>Ford Pro is focused on more than just commercial vans. The division, led by Ted Cannis, aims to sell fleet management, maintenance and charging services to commercial clients as well. Ford Pro has said it expects to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 — up from $27 billion in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s a hefty hike in revenue and a target that Ford plans to meet by selling a mix of combustion-engine, hybrid, and soon all-electric versions of its vans and </span>full-size pickup trucks; and offering depot and home charging for the EVs, digital services for customers to manage and maintain their fleets, a network of service centers, and, of course, financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford&#8217;s commercial vehicle business has a head start in Europe, where it has been the leading commercial vehicle brand for six consecutive years. In North America, Ford&#8217;s share of Class 1 through Class 7 full-size commercial trucks and vans exceeds 40%, according to the company.</p>
<p>A new opportunity to grab more market share has opened up as governments, particularly in Europe, place stricter emissions regulations in urban areas. The E-Transit cargo van, which is expected to ship to customers later this year, and the commercial variant of the F-150 Lightning Pro play a critical role in Ford Pro&#8217;s plans. The Lightning pickup truck is expected to come to market in spring 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s first pair of smart glasses doesn&#8217;t feel like much of a Facebook product.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find the Facebook logo emblazoned on them or even its name in small print by the serial code. They aren&#8217;t <em>Facebook Stories</em> or <em>Ray-Ban&#8217;s Facebook Stories </em>or even <em>Ray-Ban Stories in collaboration with Facebook. </em>Unlike other Facebook-designed hardware like the Quest 2 or Portal, the <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em> feel more self-aware and restrained as though the company knew exactly what use cases they needed to hit, and stopped themselves from trying to do much more than that.</p>
<p>The glasses made in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica are certainly the most basic device Facebook has shipped. They only do a few things, you can take photos and videos, you can take phone calls and you can listen to music. That&#8217;s it. But bringing audio into the mix via near-ear speakers embedded in the arms of the frames makes these a much more realized device than Snap&#8217;s Spectacles which shipped five years ago.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dig a bit into what this device does and how it feels to use it in daily life.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the $299 <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em> is that they can be worn pretty inconspicuously. People are probably more likely to notice the cameras than their slightly inflated dimensions. That&#8217;s already a revolutionary advance, which pushes these past the level of &#8220;toy&#8221; which Spectacles never really seemed to eclipse. The Ray-Ban partnership was particularly savvy given the thicker-than-average frames on their standard Wayfarer design.</p>
<p>What onlookers are more likely to notice is you tapping the frame of your glasses to control them. Pressing the  button on the right arm will take a 30-second video, a long-press will snap a photo. You can also use the voice command, &#8220;Hey Facebook, take a video&#8221; and do the same for photos &#8212; for the record, I&#8217;m not sure whether this is a sentence I&#8217;d feel great about hearing a stranger nearby me in public say. A small LED light sparks up when the camera is capturing footage though it&#8217;s a pretty low-key indicator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The photo and video quality of the glasses is pretty middling, but plenty of forgiveness can be levied given the size of the device. The twin 5 MP cameras can shoot 2592 x 1944 pixel photos and 1184 x 1184 pixel square format videos. The quality seems to be about on-par with where smartphone cameras were about ten years ago, so it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement. Post-processing on the phone during upload enhances the photos and hides some of their struggles with low-lighting while making the photos pop a bit more with saturation.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2200191,2200215,2200217,2200213"]</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2200191" alt="" /></p>
<p>The twin camera setup is used to add 3D effects to your photos, but at the moment the filters aren&#8217;t great and there&#8217;s honestly not much there. Hopefully, Facebook invests a bit more in the software over time but with fairly low quality photos, I don&#8217;t completely see the reasoning in having two cameras to begin with.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, is that using the glasses requires linking them to a new Facebook app called View, which is basically a simple media viewer app which gets around limitations in how media from external devices can be uploaded to your phone. This is where you can also make quick edits to your photos and videos before dumping them to your photo roll or sharing them to Facebook or Instagram.</p>

<p>Audio is probably the most interesting bit of these glasses. The near-ear speakers will surprise you with their quality in a quiet spaces and leave you dissatisfied once you find yourself in a noisier environment. Unfortunately for Facebook, most outdoor spaces are a bit louder and sunglasses are mostly being used outdoors. The audio will work in a pinch outdoors for listening to tunes, but I honestly can&#8217;t see them replacing my AirPods anytime soon. The audio is much better suited for low-fidelity activities like phone calls, but I also had some issues with the three-microphone array picking up too much background noise while I was walking outdoors.</p>
<p>Battery life is surprisingly solid, but they also have the benefit of a charging battery case which is incidentally the best place to store them. The case is a little bulky but they also include a microfiber pouch to protect the lenses. Facebook says you can get 6 hours of straight audio and &#8220;all-day&#8221; usage otherwise.</p>
<p>One of their weirder quirks is their lack of water-proofing or even splash-proofing, something that doesn&#8217;t seem like a great quality for a pair of sunglasses. It&#8217;s just one more thing indicating that while the thicker frame aesthetic of sunglasses makes more sense for a smart glasses design, this product really thrives more indoors.</p>

<hr />
<p>This isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s first rodeo when it comes to hardware and you can see the company&#8217;s maturation.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t an AR/VR device, but you can also see generations of Oculus products in the <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em>&#8216; design. On-ear audio born from the Oculus Go, a touchpad interface reminiscent of the Gear VR, simple and restrained audio controls first launched on the Quest. The hardware is a distillation of features and lessons learned from selling VR to a generally indifferent public that has seemed to warm up to it a bit over the years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also see years of Facebook screwing up its messaging and torching its brand name in the process, making itself the boogeyman of both political parties, courting enemies in the press and earning an outsized amount of distrust from the average internet user, something that probably led to these carrying so little Facebook branding. The Ray-Ban Stories will certainly have their detractors, but Facebook choosing to be conservative in their functionality and not toss in too many future-flung passive sensors will likely do them a favor. The Facebook View app is bare bones and Facebook details that photos and videos captured using the Stories won&#8217;t be used to serve ads. All that said, while we&#8217;ve certainly come a long way since the Google Glass debut in 2013, face-mounted cameras still feel icky when it comes to privacy in public and this device will undoubtedly reignite that conversation in a major way.</p>

<p>Baggage aside, my broadest takeaway is that the <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em> feel like a very important product &#8212; one that actually sells the idea of face-worn wearables.</p>
<p>The glasses are smartly designed and can be worn discreetly. That said, it&#8217;s clear Facebook made plenty of sacrifices to achieve such an aggressive form factor; the glasses honestly don&#8217;t do anything particularly well &#8212; photo and video quality is pretty lackluster, the in-frame speakers perform poorly outdoors and calls aren&#8217;t the most pleasant experience. For $299, that might make the first-generation a tough sell for some, but all that said, I think Facebook mostly made the right compromises for a product that they&#8217;ve repeatedly indicated is meant to be a stepping stone on the road towards an augmented reality future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced their long-awaited foray into the smart glasses space Thursday morning, launching the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.</p>
<p>The svelte frames are some of the most low-profile yet available to consumers and will allow users to snap photos and videos with the two onboard 5 MP cameras, listen to music with in-frame speakers and take phone calls. The glasses need to be connected to an iOS or Android device for full functionality, though users can take and store hundreds of photos or dozens of videos on the glasses before transferring media to their phones via Facebook&#8217;s new View app. The twin cameras will allow users to add 3D effects to their photos and videos once they upload them to the app.</p>
<p>The lightweight glasses weigh less than 50 grams and come with a leather hardshell charging case. The battery lift is advertised as &#8220;all-day&#8221; which TechCrunch found to be accurate during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebooks-first-smart-glasses-make-the-case-for-face-worn-wearables/">our review of the frames</a>.</p>

<p>Users will be able to control the glasses with a couple physical buttons including a &#8220;capture&#8221; button to record media and an on-off switch. A touch pad on the right arm of the glasses will allow users to perform functions like swiping to adjust the volume or answering a phone call.

<p>This is a major launch for Facebook, which announced early details about the Ray-Ban partnership and product at its AR/VR focused developer conference last September. The company has indicated that the device is a stepping stone for its AR ambitions and an effort to get users acquainted with the idea of high-tech glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray-Ban Stories are an important step towards a future when phones are no longer a central part of our lives and you won&#8217;t have to choose between interacting with a device or interacting with the world around you,&#8221; CEO Mark Zuckerberg says in a launch video for the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?w=189" alt="" width="189" height="300" class="vertical alignright size-medium wp-image-2200040" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=95,150 95w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=429,680 429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" />Storz &amp; Bickel finally updated the Mighty vaporizer. The original hit the market in October 2014 and quickly became a fan favorite despite its unwieldy form factor and market-topping price. Users point to the quality of the vapor, airflow, and its certification as a medical device as primary reasons for buying the vape.</p>
<p>The new version is called the Mighty+ and features a ceramic-coated chamber, USB-C charging, a 60-second startup time, and a new mode that will quickly boost the current temperature. And yes, this version has little feet so that it can stand vertically on a table. The Mighty+ carries a $399 MSRP and is available for purchase on September 23.</p>
<p>The company also updated two of its other products. The Volcano is now available in matte black, and the Crafty+ comes with a ceramic filling chamber and USB-C charging that reduces charging time by 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickel managed to get the Mighty+ certified by UL, a US-based global safety certification company. The Mighty+ conforms to UL8139, becoming the first dry herb vaporizer to carry UL logo officially. To S&amp;B, the UL certification is significant. The company has long differentiated itself from its competitors with a certification from TUV certifying two of its vapes, the Mighty and Volcano, as medical devices. The UL nod certifies the Mighty+&#8217;s components comply with the testing agency&#8217;s safety standards covering the electrical, heating, battery, and charging systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Underwriters Lab (UL) came out with a certification,&#8221; said Andy Lytwynec, VP of Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, &#8220;and it created a bullseye target for us. It took a lot of collaboration with them, and we just recently achieved certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lytwynec explained that S&amp;B sees consumers increasingly scrutinizing vaporizer options and feels the UL certification gives owners additional peace of mind that the device will not implode in their pocket. &#8220;For S&amp;B, we think it&#8217;s the beginning of a trend within the vaporizer market for consumers to be a bit more diligent and thoughtful, saying &#8216;Well, hold on a second, like, has a third party actually gone through the rigors of testing this.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mighty+&#8217;s new features are incremental updates developed from customer feedback. The device charges over USB-C, which can deliver an 80% charge in 40 minutes. It also heats up in 60 seconds, and hitting the temperature button three times activates an even quicker so-called Superbooster mode that quickly bumps the temp by 59 degrees. The filling chamber is now coated in ceramic which, if nothing else, should make maintaining a clean oven a bit easier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mighty loyalists will be disappointed to hear the bright LED remains from the original. Some users find the screen too bright in a dark room and susceptible to UV light that dims the screens when outside. The battery system appears to be a carry-over from the original too.</p>
<p>The form factor is the same, except for the addition of tiny feet. The original cannot stand on its own, making filling the top-mounted bowl challenging without a 3rd party stand. Now there are little fins to help the Mighty+ stand on its own.</p>
<p>How do the changes impact performance? Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t tell you until I get the device next week.</p>
<p>I asked Lytwynec about the Mighty&#8217;s use of plastic in the top-mounted cooling chamber. Competitors are moving to glass or ceramic for improved taste, I pointed out. Lytwynec notes the Mighty+ is made of a new plastic polymer, and S&amp;B is focused on using materials that allow its devices to be certified as medical devices. The company is aware of third-party accessories but feels the current cooling chamber offers the right benefits to the consumer.</p>
<p>The company also unveiled a new version of the Crafty+, its smaller dry herb vape. The new model features many of the improvements found in the new Mighty+. There&#8217;s also a new version of the company&#8217;s original vape, the desktop Volcano. This new version is finished in a scratch-free matte black finish and will retail for $699 starting September 9.</p>
<p>Jürgen Bickel and Markus Storz founded Storz &amp; Bickel in 2002 and in 2018, sold the company to Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corporation. Jürgen Bickel remains with S&amp;B and continues to run the day-to-day and drive product development.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickel sits atop Canopy Growth Corporation&#8217;s device segment. According to Canopy&#8217;s latest financial release, S&amp;B recorded $24.1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2022. This marks a 41% ($7 million) year-over-year increase. This growth is attributed to an expansion of its distribution network.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: A previous version of this article had the Mighty+ launching on September 16. That is incorrect and the article is now updated with the proper date of September 23.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to people pushing the frontiers of science, few institutions can match the talent of the Department of Defense, the intelligence agencies, and the U.S. national laboratory system. With ample budgets and flexible oversight under that aura of national security, ambitious scientists and engineers are working on everything from quantum computing to next-generation satellites.</p>
<p>That wealth of talent is often left behind in the frenetic product development and fundraising world of Silicon Valley. Langley, Arlington, and Los Alamos are a far cry from Palo Alto or New York City. Even more challenging is the career transition: the government is, well, the government, and the private sector is, well, the private sector. Moving from one to the next can be quite jarring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scoutventures.com">Scout Ventures</a> wants to act as the bridge between the startup world and that vast science and technology workforce, with a particular focus on veterans of the military, intelligence agencies, and national labs. Founded about a decade ago in 2012 by Brad Harrison, the firm raised two funds and invested in several dozen companies at the earliest stages, including identity verification platform <a href="http://ID.me">ID.me</a> (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/22/idme-reaches-billion-valuation-for-identity-software-used-by-22-states/">now valued at $1.5 billion</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/bespoke-post-series-a/">men’s subscription service Bespoke Post</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/leagueapps-raises-15m-to-be-the-operating-system-for-youth-sports-organizations/">youth sports management platform LeagueApps</a>. It also incubated companies like <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/health-tech-startup-building-social-care-networks-and-it-just-reached-unicorn-status">health services company Unite Us</a>.</p>
<p>The firm announced this morning that is has raised a $55 million third fund, which will continue its focus on backing veterans while centering its investment thesis on frontier tech in areas like machine learning, robotics, drones, physical security, quantum computing and space (that said, the firm does not invest in weapons).</p>
<p>Harrison, who has been a long-time angel investor prior to forming Scout Ventures and is a West Point grad and army airborne ranger, said that when he started to look at the track records of the most successful founders he backed, many of them happened to be veterans. So he started doubling down on that thesis, eventually hiring Wes Blackwell who graduated from the Naval Academy and Sam Ellis in Brooklyn from West Point as his co-partners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199967" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199967" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199967" class="wp-caption-text">Scout Ventures partners Wes Blackwell, Brad Harrison and Sam Ellis. Image Credits: Scout Ventures.</p></div></p>
<p>Scout is a traditional seed stage fund, and Harrison said that the firm targets roughy a deal per month, with a typical check between $500,000 and $1 million targeting 10% ownership. The firm also reserves $2-3 million in capital for follow-on investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the firm’s unique differentiators is taking advantage of ample non-dilutive funding from government programs and locking that in for its portfolio companies. Harrison said that the firm typically can secure three dollars of such funds for each dollar it invests, allowing its portfolio companies to grow faster for longer and with less dilution. “We’re seeing the most active money flowing through Air Force number one, Army number two, and then you are seeing some money flowing through the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation,” Harrison said.</p>
<p>In terms of companies, the target is so-called dual-use startups that have applications that can be used by both the public and private sectors. These are “core, disruptive technologies that we believe are going to bring a shift change, so they inherently have applications to the DoD and the commercial sector,” he said. “They are hard to find, and that is why we talk to so many companies.”</p>
<p>As examples of startups within this thesis, Harrison pointed to four companies in quantum computing and others in electronic warfare, where applications can be as important to the NSA as to telecoms like Verizon and T-Mobile. He also pointed out companies like De-Ice, which is using electromagnetic technology to make deicing of planes and other equipment faster and safer. Such technology could improve operations for the Air Force as well as civilian carriers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scout hopes that its unique network and focus will allow it to access these “hard-to-reach” founders who are “really distrustful of most VCs,” Harrison said. “That makes us competitive.”</p>
<p>Among the LPs of the new fund are the New Mexico State Investment Council (home of the Los Alamos National Laboratory), former Citigroup chairman Richard Parsons, Auctus Investment Group, restaurateur and brewer David Kassling, and Michael Loeb.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Twenty years ago, many of us had never heard of shared micromobility, let alone contemplated it as a tool for developing healthier, more equitable communities.</p>
<p>But as of 2020, more than 200 cities in North America have at least one shared micromobility system in operation with a combined 169,000 vehicles. As the industry has grown, so too has the realization that something as seemingly small as the way people get from place to place can significantly impact their quality of life.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising yet impactful roles that shared micromobility has filled recently is that of a supporter of racial justice initiatives and events.</p>
<p>According to the North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association’s <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">2020 Shared Micromobility State of the Industry Report</a>, agencies and operators provided free or discounted trips for demonstrators to get to events, while many systems donated or fundraised for racial justice nonprofits.</p>
<p>Importantly, the increased attention on diversity, equity and inclusion further brought to light our shortcomings and led to organizational change throughout the industry. For example, 71% of shared micromobility systems stated that diversity was part of every hiring decision in 2020, and 69% reported that women and people of color are represented at all levels of the organization.</p>
<p>Of course, we collectively recognize that we are not where we want or should be. However, these metrics demonstrate intention and mark progress toward improved equity, diversity and inclusion in shared micromobility.</p>
<p>We in the shared micromobility industry are continually adapting our policies and practices as we work to fit the needs of the communities we serve, whether providing discount programs for lower-income residents or making adaptive vehicles available for persons of different abilities, we understand that mobility is a right for everyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even more than that, agencies and operators recognize the importance of providing active modes of mobility for people and communities to build healthier habits, which ultimately can have positive economic, social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In 2020, North Americans gained an additional 12.2 million hours of physical activity and offset approximately 29 million pounds of carbon dioxide by utilizing shared micromobility.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers at Colorado State University <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121010033?dgcid=author">calculated</a> that in an average year, bike-share users saved the U.S. healthcare system more than $36 million, while another study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-station-micromobility-in-north-america-joby-aviation-makes-its-debut-and-sidewalk-bots-invade-campuses/">concluded</a> that scooter users accounted for $921 of unplanned spending per scooter at food and beverage establishments.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility must be considered a part of public transportation networks to maximize the community benefits and build truly functional cities. Multimodal commuting is becoming more commonplace and sought for by urban travelers. In 2020, 50% of riders reported using shared micromobility to connect to transit, and 16% of the 83.4 million shared micromobility trips taken in the same year were for connecting to public transit. Increased use and requirement of the <a href="https://nabsa.net/resources/gbfs/">General Bikeshare Feed Specification</a> (GBFS), an open data standard for shared micromobility, clarifies the growing importance of an integrated trip planning user experience.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility is a powerful tool, when fully taken advantage of, that helps transform our cities for the better. As cities, states, provinces and nations face equity, social and climate challenges, now is a critical time to engage shared micromobility as a critical component of change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m all for encouraging more young people to enter STEM, to explore engineering and perhaps ultimately pursue a career in robotics. It’s a field whose importance will only grow with time, as more of the world looks toward automated solutions. And it probably goes without saying that one of the most effective ways to bolster a workforce from automated job loss is ensuring that more people entering the workforce gain the skills for programming such machines.</p>
<p>That said, there’s really no point in sugarcoating most of this. If you think the day to day realities of becoming a roboticist involve standing onstage while one of your employees does Daft Punk cosplay to Skrillex, I’ve got some unfortunate news for you. A heck of a lot more out there are currently making 3D models of dog poop. Remember, there are no number twos in binary code.</p>
<p>You see, iRobot had a poop problem. There are dozens if not hundreds of YouTube videos documenting the phenomenon, as a Roomba approaches a pile of fresh dog droppings, hovers over it a bit, and then makes a snail-like trail of fecal smears across the hardwood or carpet. It’s honestly probably among the most widespread and unintentionally hilarious (depending on your point of view) consequences of mainstreaming robots.</p>
<p>People’s imaginations tend to project the worst-case scenarios with robots. Any time we post a Boston Dynamics video, I get dozens of responses from people recalling that one Black Mirror episode they saw that one time &#8212; it has temporarily supplanted Skynet jokes. But the truth of the matter is that a vast majority of robots have no intention of killing you. But that doesn’t mean they’re not going to unintentionally smear dog crap up and down your linoleum.</p>

<p>In preparation for the latest Roomba, however, the company spent a lot of time with pet poop. Like <em>a lot</em> a lot of time. Arguably an unhealthy amount of time studying the stuff, modeling it, taking pictures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The glorious career of roboticists may not have been fully realized when we were sending people home and creating hundreds of models of poo,” CEO Colin Angle recently told me. “Sending people around to photograph and create synthetic models of poo. I don’t know how many tens of thousands of images of all different shapes and sizes of synthetic images were required, but this is not demo code, clearly.”</p>

<p>It was among the weirder homework assignments for the Bedford, Massachusetts-based 1staff. One employee apparently got so into the work she got extremely excited when her dog had an accident on the floor. At least she got some good photos out of the deal.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rj3VUmRNnU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>When real-world animal droppings were harder to come by, the company generated fake poop in order to approximate a wide range of sizes, shapes and consistencies.</p>
<p>“You imagine it, we probably attempted it to grow a large enough database with both real images, images of fake poo and synthetic images that were manufactured of poop to serve as a training model for our robot,” Angle adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199801" style="width: 809px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199801" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2199801 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>All of this leads us to Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P.), which guarantees a free return for the new j7+ if the Roomba runs into (and over) a poop problem. For the time being, however, iRobot is strictly adhering to the old adage about letting yellow mellow. “We can’t do pee,” says Angle. “It has to have some 3D aspects to it.”</p>
<p>The poop problem was far from iRobot’s only struggle over the past year, of course. While the pandemic has ultimately served to accelerate much of the industry, the early days of global shutdowns came with their share of issues for the Roomba maker. In the early days, the company laid off 70 employees and indefinitely halted production of its long-awaited robotic mower.</p>
<p>Says Angle:</p>
<blockquote><p>The past year and a half has been an extraordinary rollercoaster. At the beginning of the pandemic, it seemed like the world was ending and 60% of our sales was coming from retail stores, which were being closed. It was a really terrifying time as we tried to figure out how to navigate. Then what happened was people were working from home. When you’re spending a lot of time at home, things get dirtier faster. If you’re used to cleaning while your kids are at school, suddenly your kids are not at school anymore. Families were tearing their hair out just to survive and keep things under control. So work from home created a significant acceleration of interest in assistive technologies.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2121617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, robotic delivery service Tortoise is about to get a pretty big boost as last-mile logistics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">AxleHire announced plans</a> to employee 100 of its robots across the U.S. AxleHire operates in the package delivery space, including perishables from meal kit companies like Blue Apron and HelloFresh. No word on precisely which markets we’re talking about here, but Rebecca notes that the company currently operates in Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Phoenix, Seattle and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpM_zX0Fe7U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s the matter of the Robotic Unicorn. I find that nine times out of 10, tech companies&#8217; claims of being “first” are dubious, at best, but XPeng Robotics’ note that this is “its first ridable robot unicorn” seems to check out. It does, however, already have some competition in the broader rideable robotic unicorn category. Forgot the overall rideable unicorn category. You can’t swing a narwhal around without hitting a rideable unicorn these days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cilvOZGehOw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s tough to say whether this is a stunt, given the extremely CG nature of the video here. XPeng is apparently using the big toy robot as a way to test the waters for a broader entry into the robotics category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The wider world of employment has seen a huge shift in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Looking for a job, finding someone to fill a role, or simply developing professionally are just not the same as they used to be for many of us. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see companies that have built business models catering to these areas changing, too: today, <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s social networking platform for the working world, announced a wave of news aimed at moving ahead with the times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launching a new Learning Hub aimed at organizations to provide professional development and other training to employees. And it&#8217;s making 40 courses free of charge to LinkedIn members specifically to address some of the changes afoot, such as how to adapt to hybrid working, how to be a better manager in the new normal, and how to return to the office, and run facilities when they are spread beyond a building to also include people&#8217;s private homes. Lastly, it&#8217;s also starting to tweak details that people can use to list and search for job openings to account for these kinds of working conditions, and more.</p>
<p>The Learning Hub was first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/introducing-linkedin-learning-hub-an-lxp-and-so-much-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> back in April of this year and has been running in a limited beta. Today, as part of a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/ryanroslanskyinconversationwith6834629124875784192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger event</a> hosted by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky where they are discussing new trends in the world of work, the Hub is being rolled out more widely.</p>
<p>For some context, LinkedIn has been long on education for years, with acquisitions like the remote learning platform Lynda <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/09/linkedin-to-buy-online-education-site-lynda-com-for-1-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2015</a> bolstering its own education strategy and position as a go-to platform for professional development; partnerships to bring in significant amounts of third-party content (for example, when it added some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/linkedin-learning-now-includes-3rd-party-content-and-qa-interactive-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13,000 courses via third parties in 2018</a>); and efforts to tie together the concept of skills development with professional profiles, running research and building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/linkedin-launches-skills-assessments-tests-that-let-you-beef-up-your-credentials-for-job-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive tools for its users</a>.</p>
<p>The free courses that are being launched today (and will remain free until October 9) are a timely set of videos to help companies as some of them start to make (or think about) the transitions from remote to in-office environments, but the bigger product launch, The Learning Hub, is not exactly an altruistic endeavor in that longer journey. It is being sold as a premium service for businesses &#8212; existing LinkedIn Learning Pro users will be able to use it for free until July 2022, potentially longer, it said. In addition to being a salient business, it is also connected to the company&#8217;s bigger efforts to bring in more businesses-focused services, and more engagement from HR departments, to bolster one of its other main revenue drivers, recruitment.</p>
<p>As a learning experience platform (often described as LXPs), LinkedIn&#8217;s relaunch of its own learning hub will bring it into closer competition with the likes of 360Learning, Coursera for Business, Workday, Cornerstone, and the many other platforms used by organizations to manage their own in-house and third-party professional training content. In addition to this, LinkedIn says it will be using its own data on employment trends, plus AI, to personalize content for organizations and users. The fact, however, that it&#8217;s also a platform whee those HR teams can also list jobs and source candidates makes it a significantly stickier experience, and one that might feel more cohesive at a time when so much else might be more fragmented.</p>
<p>The new fields that LinkedIn is bringing into its recruitment service are also notable in that regard. It will now let recruiters indicate whether a job is remote, hybrid or onsite; and soon those looking for jobs will also be able to indicate which of these it&#8217;s looking for in a new role. Companies will also be able to start indicating more details on their own company status as it relates to things like vaccination requirements, and to let the world (employees, partners, customers, interested others) know whether your physical offices are open for business or not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These new fields may sound a little trivial, or at least very specifically related to concerns and circumstances that we live with today, but I think they are more notable than this. They speak to what LinkedIn sees (and what many of us feel) are strong priorities in how we view jobs today. That opens the door to how and if LinkedIn might consider other kinds of details in company and personal profiles, as well as details that could be used in recruitment. This is something the company has also been working on for a little while already: in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/pronouns-you-might-see-on-candidate-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a> it started to give users the option of adding pronouns to their profiles. All of this is pretty important, considering that there are a lot of smaller companies and calls for someone to knock LinkedIn off its pedestal. As LinkedIn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dabbles with new formats and sunsets others</a>, it&#8217;s all signals that it&#8217;s attempting to be more adaptable to counteract that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later is growing globally &#8212; with various companies expanding to, and in, different parts of the world, such as Africa, Latin America and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S., Affirm and Klarna are big players, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square recently announced plans to acquire Afterpay</a>, which also is eyeing growth here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional buy now, pay later (BNPL) gives consumers the opportunity to pay in installments at the point of sale, either online or, increasingly, in person as well. But even domestically, the ability to pay in installments is branching out beyond e-commerce and retail.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wisetack.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that brings buy now, pay later to in-person services. And it just raised $45 million in a Series B funding round led by Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Greylock Partners and Bain Capital Ventures also participated in the financing, bringing the company’s total raised to $64 million since its 2018 inception. The latest round comes just six and a half months after Wisetack announced it had raised $19 million across its seed and Series A rounds, which were both led by Greylock.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wisetack raises $19M as its buy-now-pay-later service for IRL services scales&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/embed/#?secret=uaorJSIBEi" data-secret="uaorJSIBEi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the San Francisco-based startup helps in-person businesses offer financing to consumers. Wisetack is not the first company to do this, but what makes it different, according to co-founder and CEO Bobby Tzekin, is that it actually embeds financing options into software platforms that businesses have already built out and are using in their operations.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its focus is on service-based businesses, such as HVAC contractors or plumbers. For example, if your AC unit goes out and costs thousands to replace, you could have the option of paying for it in installments if the contractor has Wistack’s API embedded into its site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Wisetack has been able to grow rapidly by partnering with vertical SaaS businesses such as Housecall Pro and Jobber. Those companies offer consumer financing to their respective customer base, which include tens of thousands of home services professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack clearly seems to be filling a gap. So far in 2021, it has grown its revenue and loan volume &#8220;over 10x&#8221; compared to 2020. And it works with thousands of merchants, according to Tzekin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive left his job in 2018 to start Wisetack because he felt there was “clearly a massive need,&#8221; teaming up with Liz O&#8217;Donnell and Mykola Klymenko </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(who was co-founder and CTO at VaroMoney, the holding company of Varo Bank).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital, Wisetack plans to expand into other service-based verticals, such as auto repair, elective medical, dental and veterinary and legal services. It also plans to double its team of 40 over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Tzekin, the opportunity is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most service businesses are SMBs, which have historically been harder to serve than large e-commerce players. Americans spend more than $400 billion a year on residential renovations and repairs alone, according to this </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/remodeling"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the United States automotive repair and maintenance services market </span><a href="https://www.360marketupdates.com/global-automotive-repair-and-maintenance-services-market-16122737"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected to reach $250 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026, up from $201 billion in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the average BNPL online transaction is a few hundred dollars, purchases made to service-based businesses average closer to $4,000 to $5,000, according to Tzekin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO believes that buy now, pay later can be more attractive than paying for such purchases with a credit card, for a few reasons. For one, consumers have the option of paying in installments for anywhere from three months to 60 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This often means it’s more affordable to buy the better piece of equipment since they can spread the costs over time,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, just how much they will be paying over time will be made clear at the time of purchase, whereas when paying with a credit card, the amount could vary depending on interest rates and how long it takes to pay the money back, Tzekin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company makes money by charging a processing fee to merchants, as well as charging interest to consumers &#8212; which can be anywhere from 0% to 29%, “depending on how good their credit is,” Tzekin said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But credit cards charge compounded interest, whereas we charge simple interest,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners Principal Rebecca Liu-Doyle describes Wisetack as “a standout in the industry.”</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack has a differentiated platform for embedded BNPL that is purpose-built to address use cases that are both more complex and less well-served than e-commerce,” she wrote via email. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The photo-sharing app that emulates disposable cameras, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">Dispo</a> started rolling out a test yesterday that will record user interest in selling photos as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>. Some users will now see a sell button on their photos, and when they tap it, they can sign up to be notified when the ability to sell Dispo photos launches.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/daniel-liss/">Daniel Liss</a> told TechCrunch that Dispo is still deciding how it will incorporate NFT sales into the app, which is why the platform is piloting a test with its users. Dispo doesn&#8217;t know yet what blockchain it would use, if it would partner with an NFT marketplace, or what cut of sales Dispo would take.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s safe to say from the test that there will be an experience native to the Dispo app,&#8221; Liss said. &#8220;There are a number of ways it could look &#8212; there could be a native experience within Dispo that then connects through an API to another platform, and in turn, they&#8217;re our partner, but to the community, it would look native to the Dispo app.&#8221;</p>

<p>This marks a new direction for the social media app, which seeks to redefine the photo-sharing experience by only letting users see the photos they took at 9 AM the next morning. From Dispo&#8217;s perspective, this gimmick helps users share more authentically, since you take one photo and then you&#8217;re done &#8212; the app isn&#8217;t conducive to taking dozens of selfies and posting the &#8220;best&#8221; image of yourself. But though it only launched in December 2019, Dispo has already faced both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html">buzzy hype</a> and devastating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">controversy</a>.</p>
<p>Until about a year ago, the app was called David&#8217;s Disposables, named after co-founder and YouTuber David Dobrik. The app was downloaded over a million times in the first week after its release and hit number one on the App Store charts. In March 2021, the app dropped its waitlist and relaunched with social network features, but just weeks later, Insider reported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">sexual assault allegations</a> against a member of Vlog Squad, Dobrik&#8217;s YouTube prank ensemble. In response, Spark Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">severed ties</a> with the company, leading to Dobrik&#8217;s departure. Other investors like Seven Seven Six and Unshackled Ventures, who contributed to the company&#8217;s $20 million Series A round, announced that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/dispo-david-dobrik.html">donate any profits</a> from their investments in Dispo to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Liss told TechCrunch in June, when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">confirmed its Series A</a>, that Dobrik&#8217;s role with the company was as a marketing partner &#8212; Liss has been CEO since the beginning. In light of the controversy, Liss said the app focused on improving the product itself and took a step back from promotion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to data from the app analytics firm SensorTower, Dispo has reached an estimated 4.7 million global installs to date since launch. Though the app saw the most downloads in January 2020, when it was installed over 1 million times, the app&#8217;s next best month came in March 2021, when it removed its waitlist &#8212; that month, about 616,000 people downloaded Dispo. Between March and the end of August, the app was downloaded around 1.4 million times, which is up 118% year over year compared to the same time frame in 2020 &#8212; but it should be expected that this year&#8217;s numbers would be higher, since last year, the app&#8217;s membership was exclusive.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163190" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163190" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2163190" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?w=596" alt="" width="596" height="397" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163190" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dispo</p></div></p>
<p>Now, with the announcement that Dispo is pursuing NFTs, Liss hopes that his company won&#8217;t just change how people post photos, but what the relationship will be between platforms and the content that users create.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why NFTs? The most powerful memories of our lives have value. And they have economic value, because we created them, and the past of social media fails to recognize that,&#8221; Liss told TechCrunch. &#8220;As a result, the only way that a creator with a big following is compensated is by selling directly to a brand, as opposed to profiting from the content itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding NFT sales to the app offers Dispo a way to profit from a cut of user sales, but it stands to question how adding NFT sales could impact the community-focused feel of Dispo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is tremendous curiosity and interest,&#8221; Liss said. &#8220;But these problems and questions are why we need more data.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five and a half years after being acquired by a private equity firm, personal finance software company <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">Quicken</a> is announcing that it is being acquired by another private equity firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital <a href="https://www.quicken.com/about-us/press/quicken-completes-acquisition-hig-capital-and-outlines-vision">acquired Quicken</a> from Intuit Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Today, Menlo Park, California-based Quicken is announcing that Aquiline Capital Partners will be acquiring a majority stake in the company &#8212; also for an undisclosed amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Quicken CEO Eric Dunn did share some other details about Quicken’s performance since that last transaction, as well as its plans for the future. Dunn has a history with the company, so can speak pretty comfortably about where it’s been, and where it’s going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he took over as CEO of Quicken in 2016, he first joined previous parent company Intuit as employee No. 4 in 1986 when Quicken was its only software product. During his tenure at Intuit, he served as the CFO through the 1993 IPO and merger with ChipSoft (now known as TurboTax). While he was CFO, Dunn was also a software developer who worked on almost all of the early versions of Quicken, and was the first VP/general manager of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the H.I.G. buy, it appears that Quicken has grown quite a lot. It currently has 2 million active users, which Dunn said is “significantly higher” than what it had at the time of its spinoff from Intuit. The executive declined to reveal hard revenue figures but he did share that the company is profitable and has seen a 50% increase in annual sales volume over the five-year period, (or double-digit growth if you annualize it).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re strongly profitable and have been consistently profitable since the time of the spinoff. We’re a very successful company, revenue-wise &#8212; far above what it ever was in the Intuit years,” he told TechCrunch. “More importantly, we’re a successful business that has succeeded in modernizing and improving quality for our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, according to Dunn, Quicken has seen an NPS gain of 25 points over a five-year period. (NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.I.G., Dunn added, invested alongside the Quicken management team to improve product quality, bring Quicken to a cloud platform and launch a digitally native product in its personal finance app, <a href="https://get.simplifimoney.com/">Simplifi</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H.I.G. is not a growth-oriented expansion firm. They felt their work was done, and they did what they had set out to do,” Dunn said, “which is to carve out an asset with a lot of potential from a parent company which had neglected it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Reyna, managing director  at H.I.G. Capital, said the results of its investment in Quicken have been “outstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the number of financial technology companies (and potential competitors to Quicken) has exploded. But, Dunn maintains, Quicken in fact was “the first fintech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was one of the founding fintechs, the only software product at Intuit when it launched in 1983,” he told TechCrunch. “It started with the idea of automating personal finances to customers as a software tool living only on desktops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Dunn said Quicken plans to explore partnering with fintechs as it continues to evolve its model. It’s not ruling out acquisitions, but it’s also not an area of emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No layoffs are planned with the new ownership. In fact, Dunn expects the company will only continue to hire and add to its 150-person staff (not including 250 contracted “customer care agents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company will simply focus on continuing the modernization of its Quicken product and bringing more functionality to its web and mobile offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll also continue to add to our Simplifi product, which is only about 18 months into its life,” he said. “It has a great feature set but there’s lots more we need to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also focus on integrated financial services, such as allowing for money movement from account to account in the product as opposed to going to an external site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquiline is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York- and London-based private investment firm with $6.9 billion in assets under management. Its president, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vincenzo La Ruffa, says he is a Quicken user himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quicken is trusted by millions of customers, who rely on it to lead healthy financial lives,” he said in a written statement. “As a longtime Quicken user myself, I’ve seen firsthand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the work Eric and the team at Quicken have put into building a compelling suite of products and services. I am confident in the growth trajectory ahead as we work with the company to expand the range of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative solutions it offers in the personal financial management space.”</span></p>
<p>There has been a flurry of interest in fintechs focused on personal finance as of late. For example, in June, personal finance startup <a href="https://www.truebill.com/">Truebill</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">raised a $45 million Series D</a> funding round led by Accel.</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-09-08-Tinder-Opens-This-Falls-Hottest-New-Venue-Tinder-Explore">redesigning</a> its app to put a larger emphasis on its social, interactive features with the launch of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section that will feature events, like the return of the popular <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, as well as ways to discover matches by interests and dive into quick chats before a match is made. Combined, the changes help to push Tinder further away from its roots as a quick match-based dating app into something that&#8217;s more akin to a social network aimed at helping users meet new people.</p>
<p>This shift could resonate better with a younger generation that may feel like traditional online dating has lost its novelty. Today, these users are turning to apps marketing themselves <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-young-people-are-using-dating-apps-to-find-friendswithout-benefits-11626101537">as places to meet new friends</a>, while newcomers to the dating app industry are experimenting with other means of connecting users &#8212; such as with short, TikTok-like videos, as in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack</a>, or even audio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/swoonme-uses-avatars-and-audio-for-its-less-superficial-dating-app/">as in SwoonMe</a>. For Tinder, these market shifts may have represented an existential threat to its own business. But instead, the company has doubled down on interactivity as being core to the Tinder experience, and as a means of maintaining its dominant position.</p>

<p>At launch, Tinder Explore will include a handful of existing features alongside a new way to meet people. The latter allows users to connect with others based on interests &#8212; like Foodies, Gamers, Music Lovers, Social Causes, Entrepreneurs and more. Over time, more interests will be added, which will allow Tinder members to find someone based on what they&#8217;re like, rather than just what they look like.</p>

<p>Explore will also be home to Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; the interactive series that launched in 2019 as an in-app &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; story which helped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">boost</a> Tinder engagement as it gave users a reason to relaunch the app at a specific time. Tinder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">hailed</a> &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; as a success, saying the feature attracted over 20 million users during its first run and led to a 26% increase in matches. In November, the series will <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">return</a> &#8212; this time, with new characters and a new &#8220;whodunit&#8221;-style storyline. It will now also leverage the &#8220;Fast Chat&#8221; feature that powers Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; experience, which allows unmatched users to chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; will also appear in Tinder Explore, which the company describes as a more low-stakes way to match with other users. As a timer counts down, users who are chatting can choose if they want to match. If the timer expires, they meet someone new &#8212; similar to an online version of speed dating. Since launching this summer, millions of Tinder users have tried &#8220;Hot Takes,&#8221; which is only available from 6 pm to midnight local time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the bigger story about Tinder Explore isn&#8217;t just what sort of features it will host now, but what the company has in store for the future. Earlier this year, Tinder parent Match bought the Korean social networking company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Hyperconnect for $1.73 billion</a> &#8212; its largest acquisition to date. And it&#8217;s preparing to use Hyperconnect&#8217;s IP to make the online dating experience even more interactive than it is today, having announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/"> plans to add audio and video chat, including group live video</a>, to several of its top dating app properties, Tinder included.</p>

<p>Tinder Explore provides a platform where features like this could later be added &#8212; something Tinder hints toward0s, noting that the section is designed to offer users access to &#8220;a growing list&#8221; of social experiences with &#8220;many more to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A new generation of daters is asking for more from us in the post-Covid world: more ways to have fun and interact with others virtually and more control over who they meet on Tinder,&#8221; said Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone, in a company announcement. &#8220;Today’s launch of Explore is a major step in creating a deeper, multi-dimensional, interactive experience for our members that expands the possibilities of Tinder as a platform,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tinder Explore began rolling out to major English-speaking markets on Wednesday, September 8, and will be available globally by mid-October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online mortgage company <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a> has acquired U.K.-based startup <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/">Property Partner</a> as it seeks to expand into new markets and offer new product lines. The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Better plans to go public later this year through its planned merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in a deal that values it at $7.7 billion. In the meantime the company has been active in the M&amp;A market, acquiring two U.K.-based companies in the lead up to the deal’s close.</p>
<p>In July, Better announced its <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/better-com-to-acquire-uk-based-digital-mortgage-brokerage/">acquisition of Trussle</a>, a digital mortgage brokerage in the U.K. that was widely seen as its first step to international expansion. But with the purchase of Property Partner, Better could gain technology capabilities to expand its feature set in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, Property Partner enables fractional ownership of “buy to let” properties throughout the country. Through its platform, users could invest in individual properties or in a portfolio of properties and earn a portion of the rental income generated by those assets. It also created a resale market, enabling users to sell off their shares to other users.</p>
<p>The startup claims more than 9,000 investors on its property crowdfunding market and £140 million of assets under management. With the Better acquisition, the company expects to be able to expand both its investor base and properties to invest in.</p>
<p>Property Partner sent a <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/blog/better-acquires-property-partner/">message to users</a> late last week to inform them of upcoming changes as a result of the deal. The startup announced it was temporarily pausing trading on the resale market while promoting some of Better’s plans as a result of the deal.</p>
<p>Under the new ownership, Property Partner said it would be able to reduce fees, grow its investor base, and dramatically expand investment opportunities by adding properties in the U.S. and other international locations to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3nwKJ6jy7Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/better-mortgage-spac/">Anatomy of a SPAC: Inside Better.com&#8217;s ambitious plans</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Anatomy of a SPAC: Inside Better.com&#8217;s ambitious plans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/better-mortgage-spac/embed/#?secret=3nwKJ6jy7Q" data-secret="3nwKJ6jy7Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Better, the deal adds a new income stream in the short term while enabling the company to completely reimagine homeownership over a longer time horizon. Over the years Better has sought to augment its core mortgage lending business with additional products and services, including real estate agents, title and homeowners insurance, and the ability to make all-cash offers in certain markets in which it operates.</p>
<p>But in an interview with TechCrunch last month, Better CEO Vishal Garg previewed a vision for how fractional ownership could reduce friction and enable more freedom for the home-owning public:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a large population in this country that is composed of retirees and they don&#8217;t have a current income, so they cannot actually refinance their mortgage and they&#8217;re still paying interest at 6%. They&#8217;d like to move to a warmer climate. Well, they can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to sell their house, then it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to buy the other house.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t they set it up so they sell 1% of their house in Connecticut every year and establish an income stream that qualifies them to go get a cheap mortgage and sell that house in Connecticut over a period of time, to someone who wants to live there and buy a piece of property in Florida.</p>
<p>There are all these frictions and it&#8217;s honestly just a simple data-matching problem. There&#8217;s no reason you need to own 100% of your home. What if we could give you the ability to sell 10% a year or 3% of your home or 2% of your home to people who want to buy a home in your neighborhood and are not ready yet because they&#8217;re renting.</p></blockquote>
