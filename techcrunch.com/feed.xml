										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> announced today that it&#8217;s partnering with TikTok to launch a TikTok Jump that will allow users to link to movies and TV trailers, ratings, reviews, information on where to watch, clips, cast information and more. TikTok Jump is the short-form video app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tiktok-launches-jump-a-third-party-integration-tool/">third-party integration tool</a> that aims to deepen its relationships with third-party partners.</p>
<p>When posting a video, TikTok users can now select Rotten Tomatoes from the list of available Jumps. From there, you can search for the movie or TV show that you&#8217;d like to link. Then, users will be presented with an &#8220;add to video&#8221; button.</p>
<p>&#8220;Film and TV clips and soundbites have been high on <span class="il">TikTok</span>’s For You feeds, with commenters often requesting more information on the content they’re discovering,&#8221; Rotten Tomatoes said in a press release. &#8220;With the new Rotten Tomatoes <span class="il">TikTok</span> Jump, creators can easily inform and entertain audiences by accessing a treasure trove of movie, TV and streaming related content, video, information on where to watch, reviews and more on Rotten Tomatoes.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247287" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company’s partnership with TikTok allows it to reach more millennial and Gen Z users. Since launching TikTok Jump in June, the social media giant has partnered with many companies, such as Quizlet, Wikipedia, BuzzFeed and Jumprope, to allow them to create their own integrations within its app. Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through <a href="http://www.tiktok.com/jump">an application process</a>.</p>
<p>For a platform that doesn’t let all users include a link in their bio yet, TikTok Jump expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">Check back from now until the end of December for more</a>! </em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">This is a year where we&#8217;ve all had to reconsider our relationship with tech. Social media has finally been put on trial for its potential harms, including to vulnerable adolescents. Algorithms have been accused of dividing us and sending us down rabbit holes of extremism. Even tech companies with sizable &#8220;fan&#8221; bases, like Apple, have been seen in a new light as they&#8217;re challenged by antitrust lawsuits and investigations.</p>
<p>For some, 2022 may mean looking to find a healthier balance with the sort of tech we&#8217;re using in our lives. In that light, we present a gift guide that&#8217;s focused on tech that allows us to escape tech!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239269" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>AllTrails is a popular guide to over 200,000 outdoor trails, offering detailed maps, photos and reviews curated by millions of hikers and more. But the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/gift?ref=header" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AllTrails Pro subscription</a> is worth it for any dedicated hiker, biker or climber, as it offers downloadable maps &#8212; often necessary for off-the-grid hikes, as well as other handy features, like off-route notifications, a <a href="https://support.alltrails.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019246351-What-is-Lifeline-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifeline</a> feature that keeps safety contacts informed as to your trail progress and access to air quality, pollen and weather details on the maps. The company has big plans for the year ahead, too, thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/alltrails-raises-150m-after-covid-accelerates-peoples-interest-in-exploring-the-outdoors/">its recent $150 million fundraise</a>, which it plans to invest in further product development.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/gift?ref=header" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$29.99 per year or $59.99 for 3 years</a></p>
<h2><strong>Opal</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2239286" style="width: 2159px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239286" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239286 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg" alt="" width="2149" height="1494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg 2149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1068 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1424 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-24-at-11.12.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2149px) 100vw, 2149px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239286" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Phones can be distracting, taking us out of the moment and back into our screens. While recent updates like Apple&#8217;s Focus Mode feature have given us back some control, the Opal app takes things even further. The app, essentially a VPN client, lets you completely disconnect distracting apps so you can focus and easily set automatic schedules for things like work or family time where apps and notifications will leave you alone. Unlike some other tools, which can be disabled by the user, you can even configure &#8220;deep focus&#8221; sessions in Opal with a timer you can&#8217;t bypass for when you really need to not be distracted. You can use the app in a number of ways &#8212; on-demand when you need to concentrate or always on to help you craft better routines for your life with more boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> A <a href="https://www.opal.so/gift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 Gift Subscription</a> offers one year of Opal Pro</p>
<h2><strong>Light Phone</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2239303" style="width: 1410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239303" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239303 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="936" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/light-phone.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Light Phone</p></div></p>
<p>When you really need to get off the grid, the best phone could be no phone. But that&#8217;s not always viable in this day and age where we need to be able to reach others in the event of an emergency or have them be able to reach us. Plus, we don&#8217;t really want to go back to the days of printing out our MapQuest directions, right?</p>
<p>The Light Phone is another option, which could allow you to take a break without being fully disconnected. The phone allows you to make calls and texts and includes basic utilities like an alarm, calculator, a hotspot feature and a simple music and podcast player. It also <a href="https://medium.com/the-light-phone/introducing-the-directions-tool-ebf62217b276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just added a directions tool</a> and will soon add support for public transit routes. The idea is to offer a phone that&#8217;s &#8220;smart&#8221; but not filled with addictive apps and games. The Light Phone may not make sense for everyone as their full-time device, but it could be swapped in for your weekend getaway or any other time you&#8217;re feeling too overwhelmed. The phone offers <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own SIM plans</a> on AT&amp;T starting at $30/month for unlimited calls and texts with 1 GB of data, billed monthly with no commitment. But the phone itself is unlocked and will work with any compatible 4G VoLTE Nano-SIM (like the one in your current smartphone, probably.)</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $299 (Light Phone II) <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in either Light Gray or Black</a></p>

<p>Listening to podcasts and e-books is already a popular activity, but what if you could reduce your screen time by listening to just about anything with the help of a text-to-speech reader? Speechify makes this possible. The web and mobile app lets you listen to anything with text &#8212; documents, news articles, research papers, school assignments, PDFs, emails and more &#8212; using a selection of natural-sounding AI voices. The app currently supports Gmail, Outlook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Google Docs, Notion, MS Teams, PDFs, Medium, NYT, BBC, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and LinkedIn. You can even snap photos of the pages in your books to have them read aloud. But this solution is not cheap &#8212; it&#8217;s more of a commitment to shift much of your screen-based reading to audio.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $139 for 1 year of Speechify Premium (<a href="https://speechify.com/sales?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special pricing</a> is available for groups, teams and classrooms)</p>

This type of wallets put you in charge of your crypto assets as private keys are stored on your devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/making-web3-and-the-world-of-crypto-more-user-friendly-and-accessible-7ceda4b844d3">Today</a>, the company is bringing NFTs to the desktop browser. People who use Coinbase Wallet for desktop browsers will soon see a new tab called ‘NFTs’, which will let you access the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) associated with your wallet address.</p>
<p>While many mobile wallets let you view your NFT collection, such as <a href="https://rainbow.me">Rainbow</a>, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz">Argent</a> and also Coinbase Wallet on mobile, browser extensions typically don’t have a native NFT gallery feature. The feature is rolling out in a few days.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247340" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247340" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Coinbase-Wallet.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2247340" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247340" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coinbase</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the new NFT feature, Coinbase has been working on better support for testnets and alternative networks. While you can already switch between multiple networks from the settings, Coinbase Wallet will now display your token balances across all supported networks, such as Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Optimism, Polygon and xdai. It’s a sort of unified inbox for your crypto assets.</p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet will also support EIP-3085 (EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal). If a Coinbase Wallet interacts with a decentralized application that also supports EIP-3085, it’ll lead to a better user experience for the end user.</p>
<p>EIP-3085 allows dapp developers to suggest a specific network for a transaction. In other words, it makes it easier to interact with multiple networks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The main advantage of using a self-custody wallet is that you’re not limited to what’s available in the app. You can connect to a third-party dapp using WalletLink, WalletConnect, etc.</p>
<p>But Coinbase has also integrated some decentralized exchanges directly in the Coinbase Wallet interface. Interestingly, Coinbase is using Uniswap and 0x for those trades. Coinbase doesn’t generate revenue from users who exchange tokens through Uniswap or 0x.</p>
<p>In many ways, Coinbase Wallet feels like Coinbase’s web3 initiative. The company wants to remain relevant as crypto users become more and more educated and start interacting with more dapps.</p>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask</a> has been quite popular with new crypto users who want to buy an NFT for the first time. But MetaMask users will tell you that MetaMask is… not great. And Coinbase doesn’t want to stand still. It has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/coinbase-acquihires-team-behind-brd-crypto-wallet/">acqui-hired crypto wallet startup BRD</a> and it plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">its own NFT marketplace</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We surveyed select investors in web3 to find out where web3 stands and what the future holds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people have experienced the internet only through Web 2.0: online applications, the social web and software as a service form the fabric of our lives.</p>
<p>But even as other technology rapidly evolves, basic web infrastructure has remained largely unchanged since the turn of the millennium. Lately, many have championed web3 as the internet&#8217;s next phase, but the term encompasses so much territory, conversations can be rather diffuse.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still years away from web3 capturing major market share, and there are valid concerns that its complexity will daunt consumers and regulators. However, our research indicated that the investment landscape is growing increasingly competitive as venture capitalists become more educated and less skeptical.</p>
<p>To get a clearer sense of where the market is, we reached out to several active investors to find out where web3 stands and what the future holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liormessika/?originalSubdomain=il" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lior Messika</a>, founder and managing partner, <a href="https://www.edenblock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eden Block</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atul-ajoy-833b59123/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atul Ajoy</a>, partner, <a href="https://www.horseshoe.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horseshoe Capital</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidchreng/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Chreng-Messembourg</a>, founding partner, <a href="https://leadblockpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeadBlock Partners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randyglein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randy Glein</a>, founder/partner, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samshap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Shapiro</a>, principal, <a href="https://dfjgrowth.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFJ Growth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mercedesbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes Bent</a>, partner, <a href="https://lsvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaidas/">Jai Das</a>, co-founder, president and partner, <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To make things as clear as possible, we asked each respondent to share their elevator pitch: How would they describe the technology if they were trying to convince a skeptic to invest?</p>
<p>Starting with the potential consumer appeal of cartoon apes, we tried to find out what specifically attracted them to invest in the semantic web and where they&#8217;re currently seeing demand. &#8220;I initially got into web3 through verifiable credentials and data provenance in the enterprise market,&#8221; said Atul Ajioy, a partner at Horseshoe Capital. Several others said they started exploring the space after developing an interest in crypto.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing potential applications in advertising, fintech and enterprise apps, respondents shared their advice for web3 founders who are hunting for funding, along with their concerns about factors that could stall its development. Finally, we asked each respondent: What are skeptical web3 investors missing?</p>
<p>&#8220;I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go,&#8221; said Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, web3 has proven itself as more than a phenomenon — it is the foundational layer of the metaverse.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block</h2>
<p><strong>Please give us your web3 elevator pitch: What is it, and what role does it play in today’s internet framework? </strong></p>
<p>In two sentences: <strong>Web3 is the key to the <em>real </em>metaverse</strong>. Web3 will house our financial institutions, social interactions, personal identities and much, much more in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>Expanding: When I look at web3, I see an amalgam of decentralized infrastructure capable of powering a new world. The two most distinct properties of web3 are composability and decentralization. Firstly, crypto networks are swallowing up value and creating environments where every possible form of on-chain value interlinks and interacts with the other. Web3 has the unique ability to create tangible value systems out of value systems that remained intangible for millennia. It unlocks a world where our social capital, reputations, and historical interactions are given indelible and truthful assets — which often get priced into a market powered by decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Web3 is where all decentralized systems will learn to interact with each other, building on the security and value (thus network effects) of a broader ecosystem.<strong> It will be multilayered and multifaceted, supported by completely new infrastructure</strong>. Our applications will need to <a href="http://pokt.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relay data reliably</a>, <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transfer data completely privately</a>, <a href="http://ipfs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store data</a> and maintain high levels of <a href="https://celestia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">availability</a> — all on decentralized rails. In web3’s short history, we’ve already seen how <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84232/ethereum-infrastructure-provider-infura-is-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized infrastructure can be a dangerous tradeoff</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to get into the space? Cartoon apes and blockchain games don’t yet have broad consumer appeal: Where are you seeing demand for web3 products today? </strong></p>
<p>Web3 symbolizes a massive societal shift, infused with innovation and supercharged with values. I dove headfirst into the space when I understood that we’re in the midst of a cultural revolution enabled by technology — not the other way around. Crypto and web3 is our technological answer to a societal problem that has plagued us for millenia, so I think that it’s natural for us to treat this movement with respect and passion.</p>
<p>On products: Some of the most powerful web3 products that we’re seeing these days are intensely focused on ownership, creation and other contextual features that ultimately amount to our digital identities. Funnily enough, we’re already starting to see how crypto products are taking hold of our culture and of our shared attention. In the metaverse, your “pfp” is not only a skin of sorts but the key to another dimension. The individualism this basic feature enables over time explains the frenzied NFT market, which will undoubtedly remain a large part of web3 and the metaverse. The technological basis for NFTs will unlock disruptive value systems across gaming, fashion, social and creator economies.</p>
<p>On a less obvious note, coordination in large, decentralized groups (DAOs) will require streamlined frameworks and transparent value systems. As communities grow and scale into multibillion-dollar networks, decentralized governance becomes very difficult. Colony and Coordinape will enable the next generation of DAOs through specialized tooling and automated frameworks for governance and incentives.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of applications can we expect to reach the market in the near future? Where are you placing your bets, and can you name a few companies to watch?</strong></p>
<p>Within the broader context of web3, we see tremendous growth across two distinct layers in the stack —<strong> infrastructure and applications</strong>. Unlike TCP/IP (a core piece of internet infrastructure that cannot be monetized) at the dawn of the internet, decentralized protocols and baked-in incentive systems make running decentralized infrastructure extremely valuable. Technologies like the <a href="https://www.pokt.network/">Pocket Network</a> manifest this in full force, with billions of relays per week. The Pocket Network provides decentralized infrastructure to an entire ecosystem — and compensates its node runners handsomely for the work. At the current state of relays, the forecasted annualized revenue of the network is in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Another core piece of infrastructure for web3 is <strong>Biconomy</strong>. The Biconomy team is building <b>transactional infrastructure for the decentralized web</b>. Its platform abstracts away crypto transaction complexities for both developers and users. Biconomy has built a series of products that cater to developers building applications in web3 — as protocols continue to grow into mass producers of on-chain services, developers need tools to streamline their operations and integrations to allow for mass scale.</p>
<p>On the application layer, I believe that we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of interoperable value systems within the broader web3 space. Through decentralized finance, we will one day price, value and monetize every single form of capital that can be linked to us on-chain. Our favorite art pieces will pay off our mortgage on lending protocols, and our <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/like-to-earn-nft-platform-rara-looks-to-monetize-the-future-of-online-engagement-2021-08">“likes” will become financial assets</a>. <strong>In simple terms, decentralized finance will kick-start the <em>great monetization of everything</em>.</strong> Protocols like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/vega-raises-5m-to-give-anyone-the-ability-to-launch-a-derivatives-market/">Vega Protocol</a> aim to enable decentralized derivatives at scale through fair and efficient markets.</p>
<p>Another trillion-dollar opportunity in DeFi relates to a massive elephant in the room — since markets need stability to remain competitive and efficient, DeFi has largely sacrificed decentralization for stability, opting for the USD as the main underlying collateral for a huge portion of the market. Protocols like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2021/10/11/meet-float-protocolthe-algorithmic-stablecoin-built-by-an-anonymous-team/?sh=3ce17360123b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Float</a> offer an alternative, by creating a low-volatility asset that can remain completely decentralized. Without a truly decentralized collateral in DeFi, web3 is at risk.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Can you share a few of your top concerns? What are some of the pitfalls that could prevent web3 from realizing its potential? </span></strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it must be understood that decentralization <em>has </em>to be the basis for all true innovation in what we refer to as web3. <strong>It is the common thread between every truly disruptive application in today’s cryptosphere:</strong> Uniswap and its <a href="https://forkswap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many clones</a>, money markets like <a href="https://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a>, Cryptopunks and Bored Apes, and storage solutions like <a href="https://filecoin.io/store/#intro">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> — all enabled by one underlying property. Future developments across crypto networks will continue to leverage decentralization as a core enabler and build additional utility around it.</p>
<p>In the absence of decentralization, disruption is stifled. For this reason, I believe that the biggest risk for us as we venture deeper into web3 is going back to how things were. Making easy tradeoffs that take us away from the very core premise of web3 — maximal decentralization, often at the cost of performance or scalability.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the use cases and monetizable opportunities that will encourage major websites to switch over to web3? Will the prospect of increased internet regulation be a factor?</strong></p>
<p>Internet regulation is one extreme, but the more likely case is that web3 will swallow up enough value as it continues to grow for major websites to deem it <em>necessary </em>to switch over to web3. Web3 is akin to an economy, and most players will want to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Over the next decade, what are some of the major leaps you anticipate? Which aspects of web3 are overhyped?</strong></p>
<p>One major leap we will make as a society is to embrace true ownership. Financial freedom is deeply embedded in financial responsibility, and web3 is an interface to the most direct form of responsibility (and freedom) possible.</p>
<p>On the topic of overhyped aspects of web3: I believe the radical openness and permissionless access across web3 open the door to a lot of experimentation and speculation. For this reason, most of the overhyped areas of web3 will actually be found at the bottom of the most valuable markets in the space. For example, looking at anything but the top 15-20 NFT projects and their associated communities is excruciating. In the long term, overhyped segments of the market will continue to act as a signal of where much of the innovation and broader focus currently stirs.</p>
<p><strong>How competitive is the web3 investment market today? What needs to be done to grow interest?</strong></p>
<p>The web3 investment market has <em>never </em>been more competitive. Investors are rallying behind developer teams with an idea and a bank account. I believe that while the capital continues to flow into the space so freely, the fundamentals remain the same yet the stakes (both in risk and upside) have never been higher. The amount of potential value in strong decentralized use cases is almost unimaginable, and teams are scouring the world for talent. To grow even more interest, the funding will have to eventually match talent and human capital, which currently seems extremely difficult to find.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What advice would you give web3 founders who are trying to get their first check? </span></strong></p>
<p>Web3 needs new leaders and will designate them organically as this ecosystem evolves. Nowadays, web3 founders take on the roles of communicators and community builders. In a world where development is open source and contributions are largely permissionless (more often the case in applications built on Ethereum), rallying an entire ecosystem to your cause becomes an extremely unique challenge.</p>
<p>The core drivers for web3 are values-based and financially driven — thus, iterating on web3 will be a cultural and capitalistic mission. It will be incentivized by numbers, algorithms and code, and it will also be supercharged by brand, community and <em>people. </em>Web3 founders should internalize this and leverage that intimacy between developer and community to their advantage. Founders who clearly communicate the values and core missions of their project right from the outset will enable communities to form around that shared goal and propel the project into existence — and mass distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Without market intelligence, are they at a disadvantage when it comes to pitching?</strong></p>
<p>Without a certain amount of market intelligence, founders are severely disadvantaged. Web3 iterates so quickly and so sharply that even a few months of downtime can create fundamental knowledge gaps. In our investing practice, we see the stark difference between founders who are web3-native and those who haven’t taken the plunge yet. By now, it’s become clear that to build a successful product in web3, teams require a certain level of nativity to correctly identify gaps in the market, desires and needs of its user base, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know any skeptical investors? What do you think they’re missing?</strong></p>
<p>I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go. At this point, web3 has proven itself as more than a phenomenon — it is the foundational layer of the metaverse. Skeptical investors are probably missing the true meaning of Meta’s recent play, Zuck’s rather funny conversation with Gary Vee about NFTs and the general direction of digital life.</p>
<h2>Atul Ajoy, partner, Horseshoe Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Please give us your web3 elevator pitch: What is it, and what role does it play in today’s internet framework? </strong></p>
<p>Web3 is a new decentralized form of the internet where users become owners. Today’s internet, Web 2.0, is largely controlled by centralized players who capture much of the monetary value created on the internet. Web3 replaces these centralized players with decentralized networks that distribute the value to developers, creators and users. This allows these network participants to design new incentive mechanisms in on-chain for organizations like DAOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The crypto collective that bought Wu-Tang Clan&#8217;s ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ album and an NFT of the original Doge image has a new member: venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The firm tells TechCrunch it has made an investment in <a href="https://pleasr.org/">PleasrDAO</a>, a blockchain-aligned group of a few dozen crypto investors that have been teaming up to buy high-priced NFTs in recent months. The group&#8217;s purchases include the famous Doge image which they bought for $4 million (1,696.9 ETH to be exact) then later fractionalized and sold to the crypto community (it&#8217;s current implied market cap is just above $100 million). The DAO also paid some $5.4 million for a work from Edward Snowden and $4 million for the Wu-Tang Clan album.</p>
<p>A DAO (or decentralized autonomous organization) is basically a group organized formally around blockchain voting mechanisms to make decisions and invest capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A16z Crypto&#8217;s investment in PleasrDAO is not their first publicly-announced bet on the organization type. In October, the firm <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">made an investment in</a> Friends With Benefits (FWB) DAO, which they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-social-club-got-millions-from-top-vcs-andreessen-horowitz-2021-9">valued at $100 million</a>. Andreessen Horowitz did not disclose the size of their investment in PleasrDAO though council member Santiago Santos specified their overall stake of the DAO&#8217;s governance tokens was &#8220;less than 5 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many other crypto groups, PleasrDAO had a very singular ambition when it was formed &#8212; to bid on a work by digital artist, in this case one by <a href="https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1">pplpleasr</a>. Said work was an animated video advertisement for the decentralized exchange platform Uniswap. The group formed in March after crypto founder Leighton Cusack <a href="https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1375195529504829443?s=20">tweeted</a> a link to the auction and asked, &#8220;Anyone want to create a quick DAO to bid on this???&#8221; The group eventually won the bid at 310 Eth (some $525k at the time) with all proceeds for the purchase going to charity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very quickly on, we thought, a lot of the smartest minds in DeFi are here &#8212; there is an opportunity to really take this in an interesting direction,&#8221; Santos tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think, over time, the DAO grew to the point where we felt that we needed some more structure and hierarchy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has since continued making investments and bulking up its portfolio while aiming to discover new artists that it can support. Santos says he has aims for the group to become a &#8220;<a href="https://www.visitflorence.com/florence-history-and-culture/the-house-of-the-medici.html">Medici house</a>&#8221; of NFTs &#8220;where a lot of digitally native artists can come and get initiated and discovered.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;DAOs are almost the purest manifestation of what Web3 and crypto are all about,&#8221; a16z GP Ali Yahya tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>While a16z was early to crypto, the rise of so-called &#8220;crypto native&#8221; investment funds operating closer to founder and developer networks in the space has made it necessary for legacy firms like a16z to get bolder in backing new groups like DAOs. Andreessen Horowitz sees plenty of areas where they can help PleasrDAO including policy and regulatory concerns &#8212; an area where DAOs currently seem to be operating in a gray area of as unregulated investment funds of pooled capital.</p>
<p>A16z&#8217;s bet on the group is, in many ways, a leveraged bet on NFTs, which the group has already bet heavily on. This year, the firm backed NFT marketplace OpenSea, NFT gaming giant Sky Mavis and NFT music platform Royal, among others. The firm also anchored Meta4 &#8212; a $100 million venture fund dedicated to buying up pricey NFTs. These investments are being made from the firm&#8217;s massive $2.2 billion crypto-centric fund, which the firm debuted this summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to underestimate the potential of NFTs,&#8221; Yahya says. &#8220;It very well could be that NFTs will be enormous and that the total market cap of all NFTs down the line will actually be bigger than the market cap for fungible tokens.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It would have been a legendary payoff for any investor, let alone a public agency: swapping an undrivable car for a multibillion-dollar stake in a hot new EV startup.</p>
<p>Until last year, Space Florida, the state&#8217;s economic development agency for aerospace, believed that it owned 3% of Rivian as a result of a canny lease-back agreement made a decade earlier. Following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/rivian-raises-10-5b-in-one-of-the-hottest-ipos-of-2021/">Rivian&#8217;s blockbuster IPO</a> in November, that stake would have been worth nearly $3 billion based on Rivian&#8217;s current market capitalization &#8212; a more than 1,000-fold return on Space Florida&#8217;s investment. That investment, which totaled nearly $2 million, included buying prototypes from Rivian in exchange for warrants in the company as well as the cost of buying the stock.</p>
<p>Instead &#8212; and through a mechanism that neither the agency nor Rivian can explain &#8212; Space Florida has ended up holding just 60,000 shares in the company, worth less than $7 million, public records from the agency show.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So why did a commercial space booster get involved with an EV pickup maker in the first place, and how did its supposed ownership evaporate?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spaceflorida.gov/">Space Florida</a> began working with Rivian before it was called Rivian &#8212; and even before it was making electric vehicles. In 2009, RJ Scaringe founded Mainstream Motors as a spin-out from his father&#8217;s R&amp;D firm in Rockledge, Florida. His original plan was to design an ultra-efficient gas-powered coupe capable of 60 miles per gallon and bring it into production in Florida using lightweight materials and modular manufacturing, all by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>The Florida Energy and Climate Commission committed $2 million in seed money, enough for Scaringe to hire a small team to design a prototype. This is separate from Rivian&#8217;s deal with Space Florida. According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/rivian-founder-s-long-bumpy-road-to-electric-pickup">to a Bloomberg report</a>, the team then worked around the clock to produce plans for the vehicle, apart from its engine. When the plans were ready, they shipped them to a contract manufacturer in Detroit, along with a Mini Cooper for its powerplant.</p>
<p>Scaringe then pulled off what must have seemed to be a stroke of genius. In June 2010, with the company&#8217;s first prototype still just a collection of custom and scavenged parts in Detroit, Scaringe sold it to Space Florida for $500,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Originally, there was a potential that it would bring an automobile manufacturing plant to Florida,&#8221; Dale Ketcham, VP of Space Florida, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. &#8220;But it was more the possible applications off-planet, whether on the moon or Mars, that piqued our interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the first prototype, nicknamed &#8220;The Blue Thing,&#8221; arrived in Florida in October 2010, Space Florida immediately leased it back to Scaringe for $100 a year. The car was not ready to drive on public roads, let alone move into production, according to Bloomberg. But the company could use it for testing and demonstrations, including a (never-consummated) plan to speed-test it at NASA&#8217;s Shuttle Landing Facility in the Kennedy Space Center, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21151621-2011-4-8-rivian-and-nasa-space-act">records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show</a>. After the 10-year lease was up, Scaringe could repurchase the vehicle from Space Florida for a final $100.</p>
<p>But as an &#8220;additional consideration,&#8221; according to Space Florida documents, the startup would also issue to Space Florida a warrant to acquire 100 shares of its common stock, redeemable any time in the next decade, for $1,000 per share.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the little things we&#8217;d done in the past with other organizations,&#8221; Ketcham recalled. &#8220;It gave us a little piece of the pie and it gave them some cash.&#8221; Space Florida also assisted the small company with business advice.</p>
<p>Scaringe changed Mainstream Motors&#8217; name to Avera. In March 2011, he changed it again &#8212; to Rivian &#8212; and persuaded Space Florida to repeat the deal. The agency would buy three more vehicles for $1 million, and once more lease them back to Rivian for $100 a year. This time, Rivian issued Space Florida a warrant for a further 200 shares, at $1,843 each. Which means if Space Florida wanted to redeem those shares it would cost them $368,600.</p>
<p>It was a dark time for Rivian. Scaringe was scrambling for investors and down to a skeleton crew of employees. It took Rivian until June 2014 to complete the three promised vehicles, and months more to start the lease. Soon afterward, and following a big investment from Saudi Arabia, Scaringe relocated Rivian to Michigan, bought a factory in Illinois and put Florida in his rearview mirror.</p>
<p>But he left a little bit of his company behind. Space Florida recorded the Rivian warrant agreements<a href="https://www.spaceflorida.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SFL2014-FinancialStatements.pdf"> in its financial statement</a> for the year 2013. The first warrant for 100 shares, it noted, &#8220;is estimated to equal a 1% ownership interest&#8221; in the company. The second, for 200, &#8220;is equal to a 2% ownership interest.&#8221; Space Florida believed its 300 shares represented a full 3% of the young startup, albeit one whose future was still uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have our investment fund to make those kinds of investments,&#8221; Ketcham said. &#8220;Everything isn&#8217;t going to be a winner. If a company craters, then you&#8217;re S.O.L. like everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivian did not crater, however. In fact, its progress was little short of exponential, with hundreds of millions in funding flowing in from Amazon, Ford and Cox Automotive, then billions more from T. Rowe Price, Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford and others.</p>

<p>In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/an-inside-look-at-rivians-ev-ambitions-from-ai-batteries-to-electric-jet-skis/">Scaringe told TechCrunch</a>: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a good relationship with Space Florida. They hoped we would be able to manufacture there but as the company began to grow, the lack of automotive infrastructure became a problem. They do have a significant number of warrants, and I would imagine they&#8217;re quite pleased with the progress of the company given that those warrants are becoming quite valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how valuable exactly? Between 2013 and 2020, Space Florida accounted for those 300 warrants at their cost price of just under $1.5 million. In the meantime, Rivian&#8217;s valuation soared from the $10 million that the 2010 Space Florida transaction implied into the billions, and its stock split multiple times. (This means that even a handful of shares acquired in Rivian&#8217;s early days as a private company could have turned into many thousands as the company grew and eventually went public).</p>
<p>All the while, Space Florida assumed that it still owned 3% of Rivian, according to public financial statements <a href="https://www.spaceflorida.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FS-2019-Audited-Financial-Statements-Space-Florida-Final.pdf">filed as late as October 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The warrants were finally executed in late 2020. The <a href="https://www.spaceflorida.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FS-2020-Audited-Financial-Statements-Space-FLorida.pdf">latest financial statement</a>, issued by Space Florida in October, now shows the agency holding just 60,000 Rivian shares, worth less than $7 million. That is about 500 times less than a 3% stake would represent and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-much-a-%241000-investment-in-nasdaq-made-10-years-ago-would-be-worth-today-2021-09">less than half</a> of what Space Florida would have earned if it had simply invested in the Nasdaq instead of Rivian a decade ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something does feel a little weird here,&#8221; said Scott Orn, COO at <a href="https://kruzeconsulting.com/">Kruze Consulting</a>, an accounting firm that specializes in funded early-stage companies. He notes that an early ownership interest can be diluted as bigger investors come on board, or be reduced by other strategies, such as recapitalizing the company. &#8220;But you&#8217;re going to go from, say, 10% ownership to 1% ownership,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You can&#8217;t wash them out completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivian would not comment on Space Florida&#8217;s warrant agreements or ownership stake, citing shareholder confidentiality. Space Florida did not dispute the figures in its financial statements but declined to comment on the value of its investment &#8220;pending board review of policy for these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ketcham predicted that &#8220;it will still prove to have been a very nice investment for the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the large and somewhat mysterious discrepancy, Space Florida has no plans to pursue Rivian through the courts. &#8220;Our relationship with Rivian has been and remains excellent,&#8221; Ketcham said. &#8220;They did what they needed to do. And we want them to succeed as much as anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the disappearances don&#8217;t end there: Neither organization could tell TechCrunch what happened to the four original prototype Rivian vehicles that nearly rewrote investing history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/spotlight-1-year-anniversary">announced</a> today that it paid over $250 million to more than 12,000 creators this year on Spotlight, its TikTok clone. Unlike Snapchat&#8217;s friend-to-friend, ephemeral messaging, Spotlight allows users to reach a wide audience. Since last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight launched</a>, Snap says that creators are posting three times as often now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the race for short-form video dominance is underway. As TikTok became one of the fastest apps to reach <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion</a> monthly active users, competitors like Snapchat Spotlight, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts rolled out creator funds to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">incentivize</a> people to make content specifically for their platform. Instagram Reels <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html">won&#8217;t promote uploads</a> with a TikTok watermark, while Snapchat reduced its original $1 million-per-day payouts because it was paying for too much &#8220;<a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snapchat-spotlight-copycat-content-spiegel-1235071625/">copycat content</a>,&#8221; CEO Evan Spiegel said in September. Even platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/twitter-is-the-latest-platform-to-test-a-tiktok-copycat-feature/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/twitter-is-the-latest-platform-to-test-a-tiktok-copycat-feature/">Twitter</a> are experimenting with TikTok-like feeds.</p>
<p>Now, Snap says that 65% of Spotlight submissions use a Snapchat creative tool like an augmented reality lens &#8212; in particular the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/">Cartoon Style 3D Lens</a>, which went viral this summer, generated 2.8 billion impressions in just its first week on the app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247227" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247312" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247312" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2247312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Story-Studio-1.gif?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snapchat Story Studio</p></div></p>
<p>Snap is also catering toward creators with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-story-studio-a-new-standalone-app-to-edit-stories/">Story Studio</a>, a standalone app released at the Snap Partner Summit in May. Some creators edit their videos with tools like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere on their desktops, then send them to their phones &#8212; but Snap has tried to give users more flexibility. Story Studio lets creators do more intensive editing on their phone, while the Spotlight for web app allows users to upload their content without leaving their computers.</p>
<p>Creators can also profit on Spotlight through in-app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/">gifting</a> and Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/snap-to-launch-a-new-creator-marketplace-this-month-initially-focused-on-lens-creators/">creator marketplace</a>, which allows brands to more easily collaborate with AR developers and influencers. Creators receive a share of the revenue from gifts, but they keep 100% of the revenue earned through the creator marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to Day One of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>! Get ready for two full days of programming dedicated to the visionary people forging and funding a sustainable space economy — a little something we like to call Space 2.0.</p>
<p>Ready to join your global community of space pioneers to learn, network and create opportunities? Soak up all the interviews, panel discussions, fireside chats and breakout sessions with the space industry’s mightiest movers and shakers — founders, investors, government policy makers and academics — it’s a veritable a galaxy of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Admit one:</strong> Still need a pass? We don’t judge — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">get yours here</a> and join this global space mission.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here’s a quick glimpse of what you can experience today. You’ll find times for all presentations listed in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#24513748-ac7b-490b-ad48-4b0767bf0c58">event agenda</a>, which will automatically reflect your specific time zone. Okay, let’s get to the, ahem, right stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Money, Team Space: Company Concept, Capital and Customers</strong> —Disruptive and game-changing technology and entrepreneurial initiatives are the new space norm. However, a great technical design is not enough to sustain these entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing an idea across markets also takes capital and customers. Transitioning from concept to development phase is more likely to succeed when a company can obtain stable forms of capital and potential long-term customers. The Fast Money session focuses on how a startup identified the right venture partners to grow its business and secured opportunities to prototype and test its designs with the U.S. government. Presented by The Aerospace Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>New Kids on the Launch Block</strong> — There’s a new crop of launch companies nipping at the heels of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, including Astra, Firefly and Launcher. We’ll hear from their leaders about what the opportunities are in the evolving launch market, and how they’re posted to take advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Maneuvering Towards Better In-space Propulsion</strong> — What goes up must come down, but we can delay that second part a bit with better propulsion on our satellites and spacecraft. Accion Systems, Phase Four and Morpheus Space are pushing the boundaries of in-space propulsion and will discuss the challenges and opportunities in changing how in-space assets move about.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Space SPACs and the Public Market</strong> — We saw a number of space companies go public this past year, and many took the SPAC merger route to get there.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are already a number of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-give-cryptocurrency-as-a-gift-5205409">ways to gift cryptocurrencies</a>, but today Cash App will make doing so simpler with a new feature rolling out to its peer-to-peer payments app. The app, owned by Block (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">formerly known as Square</a>) will now allow users in the U.S. to send bitcoin, as well as traditional stocks, as gifts to other U.S. Cash App users.</p>
<p>While services like <a href="https://www.stockpile.com/gift/basket/choose_stock">Stockpile</a> and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/gifting">Coinbase</a> allow users to gift stocks and cryptocurrencies, respectively, Cash App notes this is the first time such features have been offered in a peer-to-peer payments app.</p>
<p>The feature builds on prior <a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/31021-sending-and-receiving-bitcoin">functionality</a> Cash App offered that allows users to send bitcoin to any $Cashtag on the app for free. What makes this new &#8220;gifting&#8221; feature different is that now, users can send bitcoin using their Cash App USD balance or debit card, not just their existing bitcoin balance. That means users don&#8217;t have to actually own any bitcoin &#8212; or any stock, for that matter &#8212; on the Cash App mobile app in order to send it as a gift.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247104" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247137" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247137" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2247137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=768,1577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=748,1536 748w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=998,2048 998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-btc-3.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247137" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p>
<p>To make this feature work, users will actually be sending the fiat value of the stock or the bitcoin from either their Cash App balance or a linked debit card, the company explains. While the earlier feature of sending bitcoin was accessed from the investing tab, the new feature is available both from the app&#8217;s payment tab or from a new &#8220;gift box&#8221; button on the investing tab.</p>
<p>The recipient will then receive the market value of the asset at the time they accept the gift. But if they&#8217;d rather not take the stock or bitcoin &#8220;gift,&#8221; they can instead choose to receive the gift in USD.</p>
<p>Of course, the launch arrives just in time for Cash App to capitalize on holiday gift-giving and could make for an easy last-minute gift. But the company notes users can now also choose to split bills and pay back friends by sending them stocks or bitcoin, not just cash.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More importantly, perhaps, the feature may serve as a way for existing users to encourage newcomers to investing to get started with stock ownership or bitcoin via Cash App, as opposed to a competitor&#8217;s app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247139" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247139" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2247139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=768,1577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=748,1536 748w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=998,2048 998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/send-stock-3.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p>
<p>Cash App isn&#8217;t the only peer-to-peer app that has expanded into the investing or crytpo market &#8212; its top rivals, PayPal and Venmo &#8212; also both offer the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Plus, Venmo this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/venmo-to-allow-credit-cardholders-to-automatically-buy-cryptocurrency-with-their-cash-back/">added the ability</a> for credit card users to buy cryptocurrency with their cash back, as another means of pushing users to invest through its app. It had positioned the feature as a way for newcomers to enter the market without having to worry about the process of making cryptocurrency purchases.</p>
<p>Similarly, Cash App&#8217;s gifting feature could help draw in other new investors who wouldn&#8217;t have necessarily sought out bitcoin investments on their own, but were invited to do so by a friend or family member.</p>
<p>The new feature is launching today for Cash App users located in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released a new Android app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect">&#8220;Tracker Detect&#8221;</a> to help people who don&#8217;t own Apple products to identity unexpected AirTags near them in an effort to boost privacy. If a user thinks they may be being tracked, they can use the app to scan for nearby AirTags. If the app finds any, it will flag it as an &#8220;unknown AirTag.&#8221; If a detected item tracker is known to be moving with a user for more than 10 minutes, users will be able to play a sound on the detected item tracker to help locate it. From there, the user will be given instructions on how to learn more about it and how to disable it by removing the battery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tracker Detect looks for item trackers that are separated from their owner and that are compatible with Apple’s Find My network,&#8221; the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect">description reads</a>. &#8220;These item trackers include AirTag and compatible devices from other companies. If you think someone is using AirTag or another device to track your location, you can scan to try to find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At launch, the Tracker Detect app on the Google Play Store and is compatible with supported Find My network supported item trackers, which include Apple&#8217;s AirTag and the Chipolo ONE Spot. It won&#8217;t work to find other non-Find My compatible trackers, like Tile, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247210" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247210" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2247210" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="725" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png 1576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=1536,1088 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-11.12.44-AM.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Apple</p></div></p>
<p>It also can&#8217;t help users keep track of AirTags associated with an Apple account, so it can&#8217;t be used to actually take advantage of AirTags&#8217; full capabilities.</p>
<p>“AirTag provides industry-leading privacy and security features and today we are extending new capabilities to Android devices,&#8221; a spokesperson for Apple told TechCrunch in an email, confirming the new app&#8217;s launch. &#8220;Tracker Detect gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a user finds an unknown AirTag, they can tap it with an iPhone or another NFC-capable device and instructions will guide them as to how to disable the AirTag. Users with the Tracker Detect app will be able to learn more about the AirTag as well as read instructions on how to disable it from within the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of the new app follows concerns that Apple&#8217;s AirTag could be used to secretly track people, as they&#8217;re small enough to be discreetly placed in a bag or a coat. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/">Washington Post report</a> from earlier this year explained how Apple&#8217;s AirTags made it easier to potentially stalk someone without them knowing. There were many other reports that also alleged that the tracking devices can be used to secretly surveil individuals.</p>
<p>In response to these reports, the tech giant updated the time period after which an AirTag that is no longer with its owner will play a sound when moved. Originally set for three days at launch, Apple changed the time period to a randomized time between 8 and 24 hours. A user&#8217;s iPhone will also display an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227">&#8220;Item Detected Near You&#8221; message</a> if it detects an unknown AirTag near it, which means that iOS users don&#8217;t need a separate app to locate unknown AirTags.</p>
<p>However, since there wasn&#8217;t a way for Android users to discover nearby unknown AirTags, Apple had also announced that it planned to launch an Android app to enable users to detect an AirTag that may be traveling with them.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised over AirTag, Apple&#8217;s support for scanning for trackers put the company ahead of the competition which had yet to offer any such anti-stalking functionality. Following the launch, competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/tile-unveils-its-new-product-lineup-including-its-upcoming-apple-airtag-rival-tile-ultra/">Tile said</a> it would allow anyone to use the Tile app to perform a manual scan at any time. The feature is expected to arrive in early 2022.</p>
<p>Apple launched AirTag <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">earlier this year in April</a>. They are priced at $29 each or $99 for a pack of four. The item tracking uses the company’s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what Apple calls “Precision Finding.” The device also uses Bluetooth LE (low-energy).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is now rolling out access to its new, lower-cost Apple Music Voice plan, first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">introduced</a> this fall at the company&#8217;s hardware event. The new service, designed largely for use with HomePod speakers or AirPods, limits consumers to accessing Apple Music using Siri commands. Due to its stripped-down nature, the voice-only service is offered at $4.99 per month, compared with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">$9.99 per month</a> for a standard individual plan.</p>
<p>The new music subscription is a part of the broader iOS 15.2 update, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/">which also brings</a> other features like app privacy reports, Message safety warnings for children, a &#8220;Hide My Email&#8221; privacy feature, and more.</p>
<p>Initially, some people may have been confused as to why anyone would want a music subscription designed only to be used by way of voice commands. But Apple was not the first company to go this route, in fact.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247160" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2019, Amazon introduced a more affordable way to stream its Amazon Music service with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/amazon-music-echo-ads/">launch of a free, ad-supported tier</a> that streamed only over its Echo speakers. In other words, it was a version of Amazon Music that could only be accessed by way of Alexa commands.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s Siri-only service is similar, but isn&#8217;t restricted to Apple&#8217;s smart speakers alone. Instead, Apple says users will be able to request music using any of their Siri-enabled devices, including the HomePod, AirPods, iPhone, or other devices, as well as CarPlay.</p>
<p>The new voice-only tier isn&#8217;t a pared-down version of Apple Music with a limited song selection. Like traditional subscriptions, subscribers will gain access to Apple Music&#8217;s catalog of 90 million songs, its tens of thousands of playlists, and its hundreds of new mood and activity playlists, personalized mixes, and genre stations. It also includes Apple Music Radio.</p>
<p>To access this content, <a href="https://support.apple.com/music/voice">users can request</a> a song, album or artist via Siri, or, more likely, they can ask for a genre or type of playlist by using voice commands like &#8220;play something chill,&#8221; or &#8220;play the dinner party playlist,&#8221; or even &#8220;play more like this.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voice Plan subscribers can also use the Apple Music app to some extent. But instead of being able to browse across the full library, as usual, a &#8220;Listen Now&#8221; screen will present music they had recently played and will help them to discover more recommendations that can be played with either a tap or a Siri command. A Radio tab will offer access to live and on-demand radio. And there is a Search feature, but you can only play the results by asking Siri. The app will also include a section that teaches users how to optimize Siri for Apple Music.</p>
<p>Users can give Siri specific feedback by saying things like &#8220;I like this song,&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this song,&#8221; and learn about the music being played by asking things like who sings a song, the song or album name, the release year, and more.</p>
<p>Over time, users who engage with Apple Music with their voice will be training Siri to better understand their preferences. That means they&#8217;ll be able to ask Siri to &#8220;play some music I like&#8221; or &#8220;play my favorites mix&#8221; and Siri, in theory, would deliver music they enjoy listening to.</p>
<p>In addition to being competitive with Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/echo">Echo-only plan</a>, the Apple Music Voice Plan could help Apple gain access to a trove of user data on Siri usage, which could help it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/apples-new-music-subscription-plan-is-likely-an-audacious-attempt-at-improving-siri/">improve</a> its product, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704233/siri-apple-digital-assistant-10-years-development-problems-why">has lagged behind</a> both Alexa and Google Assistant. More broadly, it&#8217;s also just an easy way for Apple to entice price-sensitive users to try out a paid music subscription service for the first time. Further down the road, the voice plan could lead these users into higher-priced tiers after they realize the convenience of having access to on-demand and ad-free music, instead of relying on a free, ad-supported option like Pandora.</p>
<p>The Apple Music Voice is available via the iOS 15.2 update in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you shop for a holiday gift, you probably read at least one review. Garner Health’s bet is when you look for a doctor, you’ll want to do the same thing &#8212; but you’ll find that existing reviews aren’t enough to go on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garner Health, founded in 2019, is a service designed to help people sort through doctors. The company contracts with employers who offer health plans to workers. Employees can search through Garner’s app for doctors in their area, particularly ones who have expertise in their particular issue. And, if employees use the service to select a doctor, they’ll unlock funds provided by employers to cover medical costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company closed a $45 million Series B round on Tuesday, led by Redpoint Ventures. It includes participation from Founders Fund, Thrive Capital and Optum Ventures. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round follows a Series A round <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/finding-the-best-doctors-garner-health-brings-in-12-5m-series-a-for-recommendation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised in February</a>, and brings the company’s total financing to $70 million, CEO and founder Nick Reber told TechCrunch. This includes previous investment from Sequoia Capital and Maverick Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reber said interest in this round has been driven by a tenfold increase in Garner’s client base, savings on healthcare costs for employers and a high rate of employee use of Garner’s service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re, on average, saving 10% realized savings for our employers. And we&#8217;re getting over 40% of employees to use our tool to find a doctor. So we&#8217;re really proud of both of those numbers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, Garner’s doctor search functionality doesn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sound </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all that different from a service like Zocdoc (though Zocdoc has raised some </span><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/zocdoc-banks-150m-new-funding-as-it-expands-into-virtual-care-vaccine-scheduling" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million in growth financing this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and has about a </span><a href="https://www.investx.com/issuer/ZocDoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2 billion valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Garner differentiates itself in two ways: the data it uses to rank, and analyze doctor performance, and the incentives it’s offering to employees and employers to use the service. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garner Health’s doctor recommendations are compiled not from crowdsourced reviews, but rather, from medical claims data. Reber said that the company’s algorithms have combed through some 200 million patients’ worth of claims, and compared the procedures doctors are actually prescribing to those considered best practice in scientific literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Working with the medical community, we’ve written over 500 different individual measures, of how doctors should treat different patients, and what are good health outcomes,” said Reber. “And we measure these individual behaviors in the claims data, and that gives us a lot more insight into how they practice who they&#8217;re keeping.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result, per Reber, is a “totally objective” review system. Albeit, one that relies on the byzantine process of submitting medical claims. Medical claims </span><a href="https://openpublichealthjournal.com/contents/volumes/V2/TOPHJ-2-11/TOPHJ-2-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conduct public health research, but there are some underlying problems with the approach: for example, medical claims may be incomplete, and certain conditions may not have billing codes, </span><a href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(13)01164-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as one review points out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also easy to imagine that a system like this might privilege some doctors over others in unintended ways. If a doctor works with a community with high rates of underlying disease, or a community that’s already underserved medically, would that harm individual performance metrics, even if the doctor does the best they can? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reber says his team is “obsessive about this.” His algorithms, he argues, will only compare doctors based on groups of comparable patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second piece of Garner’s puzzle comes down to the way the company plans to work with employers. Part of the company’s promise is that if you select a doctor using the service, it will “unlock” funds provided by an employer to help cover out-of-pocket costs of the visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the sell on that for employers? Reber’s pitch is that, already, companies are facing mounting healthcare costs and risk losing talent if they cut employee benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers do see healthcare costs as a pain point. One </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/report/how-large-employers-view-rising-health-care-cost-and-the-role-of-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 300 large private employers conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 83% agreed that the cost of healthcare benefits was excessive (49% moderately agreed, 28% considerably agreed and 6% strongly agreed). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, employers in general expect their healthcare costs to rise moderately next year &#8212; about 5%, per a </span><a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-US/News/2021/10/with-healthcare-cost-increases-returning-to-pre-pandemic-levels-us-employers-focus-on-affordability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by benefits consultant Willis Towers Watson. This is, in part, driven by the fact that people will likely begin routine screenings and treatments that were once stalled during the pandemic’s first peaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers can go a few different routes to offset costs. Some are considering adding “spousal surcharges” to existing premiums, or may narrow the selection of in-network options, per the </span><a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-US/News/2021/10/with-healthcare-cost-increases-returning-to-pre-pandemic-levels-us-employers-focus-on-affordability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willis Towers Watson survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other companies might pick up the slack themselves. Among the largest of the 1,502 employers surveyed by human resources consulting firm Mercer, </span><a href="https://www.mercer.com/newsroom/employers-expect-an-increase-in-health-benefit-costs-for-2022-as-they-focus-on-improving-employee-benefits-rather-than-cost-cutting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will actually decrease premium costs to employees in an attempt to retain talent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reber’s aim is to convince companies that Garner can help them stick with option 2: retain existing benefits, with the hope that directing patients toward certain specialists will cut long-term costs. So far, the company claims to have realized 10% savings for employers in terms of healthcare costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, to sweeten the deal for employees, employers use some of those savings to cover some of the out-of-pocket bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The basic idea is we&#8217;re going to cover that deductible bill, that copay, that coinsurance bill. And when you do, we know more savings are going back to your employer, which means that total costs borne by the employer are going down,” said Reber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, says Reber, Garner has worked with about 100 clients in 47 states. But with this current round, Garner will look to expand its client base. Garner’s platform works with both large and small companies, but Reber sees special opportunities for companies in the small to mid-size range. Those companies, Garner says, have often been left out of advanced benefits solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has other plans for the round beyond expanding a client base. The company is also in the process of rolling out a “scorecard” service specifically for doctors and providers. For example, it might reveal that one doctor is performing more of a certain test, or has a higher level of complications among patients than a regional average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That service is intended to give doctors insight into how their patients do relative to other specialists, or, for instance, help primary care physicians make referrals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, this provider and doctor-based service is a small arm of the business. So far, Reber says that they’re piloting this service with “a few” large primary care groups, hospital systems and other multi-speciality providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the funding will also go toward improving Garner’s data science and analysis capacity.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to apply for a mortgage, you know that it can be a time-consuming, expensive and often painful process &#8212; both in terms of just filling out the application and then waiting for the transaction to close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a number of digital lenders have emerged to bring more technology to the process with the goal of making it all less tedious and slow. What we have seen less of are startups building the digital infrastructure to help these lenders deliver on a mortgage much faster than has historically been possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Staircase. The Philadelphia-based startup has developed an application programming interface (better known as an API) that aims to bring together the various parties involved in the mortgage origination process. By integrating all these different parties, Staircase is pledging to provide a better &#8212; and significantly faster &#8212; experience for the borrowers and the companies that are providing the mortgages.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The sheer number of entities and systems that must share and validate data to originate a loan makes it a complicated transaction. The lack of a universal language among all of these systems makes it even more difficult,&#8221; Staircase CEO and co-founder Adam Kalamchi. &#8220;What we are doing is creating an integration orchestration layer that brings all of those parties together and makes all these new mortgage-related technologies available instantly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at some numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It currently takes an average of 45 days to obtain a mortgage loan, and according to a recent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), total loan production expenses totaled an average of $9,140 per loan in the third</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">quarter of 2021.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Staircase says that its API can give every participant in the process a way to talk to one another “in just a few clicks” and thus, will bring down the time to get a mortgage to 10 days, and the cost to originate a loan to $1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamchi (a former proptech investor) and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soofi Safavi (who worked for years in application development at JPMorgan Chase) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">started Staircase when they realized “there was no clean set of API infrastructure that was purpose-built for mortgage.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there&#8217;s so many technologies out there that are amazing, but you have to integrate them one by one by one. And they’re all different,” Kalamchi told TechCrunch. “The thing we&#8217;re here to do is to make it better, faster and cheaper</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Staircase is doing for the mortgage industry what AWS marketplace does for the enterprise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like AWS, we want our product to stand on its own and be easy to integrate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lofty claim. But one that a number of investors are willing to take a bet on. Staircase has closed on $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Bessemer Ventures, bringing the company’s total raised since its early 2020 inception to $24 million. RRE Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vid Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, MetaProp Ventures and Zigg Capital also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As with many of our most successful developer platform investments at Bessemer and within the industry, the Staircase team has been doing the hard work to build a platform for developers that solves the most critical data, integration and workflow problems within the mortgage landscape,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Charles Birnbaum, partner</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at Bessemer Venture Partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting to know Staircase since the company&#8217;s formation and working with early customers, we were excited to back them in this journey to help finally bring among the slowest movement segments of the financial services landscape into the cloud by making it easier to access modern solutions without completely replacing legacy systems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting thing about Staircase’s APIs is that its founders claim it won’t just help digital lenders, it can also help a wide range of entities including government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, employment verification services, first-generation mortgage technology providers like Ellie Mae and Black Knight, mortgage insurers, retail banks and wholesale banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That too is appealing to Bessemer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There have been some great new products that have enabled the mortgage industry to begin to provide more digital experiences to their end customers over the past several years but no true platform like Staircase to tie it all together and work with both innovative, digital-first as well as legacy providers in order to automate more of the process and leverage the cloud in the same way that many other segments of consumer financial services have already been doing for quite some time,&#8221; Birnbaum told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Staircase plans to use its new capital in part toward hiring so it can continue developing its product. Out of 50 some employees, more than 40 are engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just all about product development, and maturation, and then going into the market and making sure the technology is helping borrowers,” Kalamchi said.</span></p>

<p>Among those is a pickup, which could compete with the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Ford&#8217;s F-150 Lightning</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Rivian&#8217;s R1T</a>.

As such, there could be an electric option for the next version of that pickup.</p>

<p>Other models include a Sports EV and an FJ Cruiser-style Compact Cruiser EV. There are commercial models too, such as the Micro Box and Mid Box. Toyota once again showed off the self-driving e-Palette, which was used to transport athletes during this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-toyota-e-palette-tokyo-olympics-2020.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Summer Olympic</a> and Paralympic games. The company pulled them from use at the Paralympics after the EV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-epalette-tokyo-paralympic-games-collision-201745169.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">hit a visually impaired athlete</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the higher end of the spectrum, Toyota also <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/12/14/lexus-rz450e-electric-car-concept-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="0">revealed</a> a lineup of Lexus electric EV concepts. It said the Electrified Sport should be able to go from 0-60 MPH in just over two seconds and have a range of about 435 miles. The brand also showed off an Electrified Sedan and Electrified SUV.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-12%2F629aab20-5cf1-11ec-bb67-a1754e316901&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=7d2bac9a940143dc52bbdee9e62964073c0d805b" alt="Lexus concepts for upcoming electric vehicles." data-uuid="d2b9b853-8c5c-3eb3-a5c8-1798fd16518a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toyota</div>
</figure>
<p>Although Toyota has now committed to spend around $70 billion on electrifying its vehicles, its medium-term projections for EVs are relatively conservative. It <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-says-have-30-battery-electric-line-up-vehicles-by-2030-2021-12-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">expects</a> to sell around 3.5 million EVs per year by 2030, which is around a third of its current volume of vehicle sales.</p>
<p>By contrast, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-ev-sales-2030-target-153212862.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1">Volkswagen estimates that</a>, by that time, half of its vehicle sales will be electric models, and by 2040, the majority of its sales in major markets will be EVs. After becoming an early leader in hybrid vehicle tech, Toyota is playing catchup with other automakers in the EV market, so making comparatively muted projections shouldn&#8217;t come as too much of a surprise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Toyota recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-greensboro-randolph-megasite-ev-annoucement-202448241.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1">announced plans</a> to build a $1.29 billion EV battery factory in North Carolina by 2025. The company last month declined to join other automakers, including GM and Ford, in pledging to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. However, Lexus plans to only sell EVs by 2035.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[If Pair’s announcement is any indication, the direct-to-consumer eyewear market is doing quite well.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Purchasing new glasses used to be about finding the right pair that would go with everything until you needed the next set. <a href="https://paireyewear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pair Eyewear</a> turned that on its head with magnetic frames, called Top Frames, that enable glasses-wearers to change their style with any outfit or any occasion for as little as $25.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, Pair grew its revenue 10 times year over year and attracted the attention of investors who pumped $60 million of new Series B funding into the company to give Pair $73.5 million in total funding. The round included investors like Rick Yang of NEA, NFL player Christian McCaffrey, Olivia Culpo, Sterling K. Brown and YouTube and professional gamer Ninja.</p>
<p>We profiled Pair and its co-founders Sophia Edelstein and Nathan Kondamuri back in April when the company secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/pair-eyewear-raises-12m-to-bring-more-personality-to-your-glasses/">$12 million in Series A funding</a>. At the time, the company was touting its magnetic base frame and interchangeable Top Frames for children.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“One of our main priorities was to expand, and while we are focused on children, we launched a full adult collection and started growing,”  Edelstein told TechCrunch. “We were capitalized, but received so much investor interest. With how well the adult collection was doing and after meeting with Rick, it made sense to partner and put together more capital to grow.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pair Eyewear raises $12M to bring more personality to your glasses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/pair-eyewear-raises-12m-to-bring-more-personality-to-your-glasses/embed/#?secret=DLv5vSyLE5" data-secret="DLv5vSyLE5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since the Series A, the company secured licensing deals with brands like Marvel, Major League Baseball and Harry Potter. Pair Eyewear began 2020 with four people and now has 65 full-time employees, most of whom joined in 2021, Kondamuri said. In addition, more and more adults wanted Top Frames for their glasses as they purchased them for their children, so the company began its line of adult Top Frames, Edelstein said.</p>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to continue growing, Kondamuri said. In 2022, the company intends on attracting a broader customer base, growing its team and offering unique products. In addition to current licensing agreements, the company will add more brands in the celebrity, art and sports areas to its list that also includes DC Comics and Sesame Street.</p>
<p>What they also learned was that as Pair Eyewear leveraged more social media coverage, adults also were asking for a way to change their style on a continual basis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246761" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246761" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2246761" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?w=680" alt="Pair Eyewear" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg 6103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adult-product-photo-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246761" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pair Eyewear</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“They want to match glasses to their outfits and moods, and we found that adults are even better customers because they purchase more rapidly for themselves,” Edelstein said. “We have customers that now own hundreds of tops, and there are now thousands of posts on TikTok of them switching them out on.”</p>
<p>If Pair’s announcement is any indication, the direct-to-consumer eyewear market is doing quite well. Other companies are working to make glasses more hip, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/cheeterz-club-wants-to-make-reading-glasses-hip/">Cheeterz Club</a>, while Warby Parker found success when it made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly/">public debut via direct listing</a> in September. Edelstein believes Pair Eyewear’s differentiation is its razor blade business model, which brings back customers on a monthly basis as new styles drop.</p>
<p>Yang says that at a macro level, Pair has enabled a new consumer fashion category and that in seeing how consumer behavior has changed over the years, there is organic excitement for what the company is doing.</p>
<p>In fact, Pair’s recurring and repeatable business model is proof of why Yang himself owns the number of Top Frames that he does, Yang added.</p>
<p>“It is one of those things where there is product market fit, but the more exciting piece is changing the way people think about eyewear,” he said. “What Pair is doing is not only in a capital efficient manner, but some of the numbers look software-like, and that is exciting. To me, the overlay of a big consumer trend they are riding, and in so many ways enabling, is an important part of our investment thesis.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K.&#8217;s antitrust watchdog has given the clearest signal yet that interventions under an upcoming reform of the country&#8217;s competition rules will target tech giants Apple and Google &#8212; including their duopolistic command of the mobile market, via iOS and Android; their respective app stores; and the browsers and services bundled with mobile devices running their OSes.</p>
<p>So it could mean good news for third-party developers trying to get oxygen for alternatives to dominant Apple and Google apps and services down the line.</p>
<p>Publishing the first part of a wide-ranging mobile ecosystem market study &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">announced this summer</a> &#8212; the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said today that it has &#8220;provisionally&#8221; found Apple and Google have been able to leverage their market power to create &#8220;largely self-contained ecosystems&#8221;; and that the degree of lock-in they wield is damaging competition by making it &#8220;extremely difficult for any other firm to enter and compete meaningfully with a new system&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247095" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The CMA is concerned that this is leading to less competition and meaningful choice for customers,&#8221; the watchdog writes in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/apple-and-google-duopoly-limits-competition-and-choice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. &#8220;People also appear to be missing out on the full benefit of innovative new products and services &#8212; such as so-called ‘web apps’ and new ways to play games through cloud services on iOS devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulator said it&#8217;s also concerned consumers could be facing higher prices versus what they would have to pay in a more competitive market, including for Apple phones, app subscriptions and purchases made within apps.</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s study points to a now (very) familiar line-up of competition concerns attached to how the tech giants operate their platforms, and thereby maintain what its PR characterizes as a &#8220;vice-like grip&#8221; over mobile devices, including bundling services; self preferencing; restrictive T&amp;Cs for third-party developers; and the 30% commission each platform can charge on some in-app payments. (Or what some irate third parties, such as Epic Games and Spotify, like to attack as the &#8220;Apple tax&#8221;; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-calls-app-store-fees-a-de-facto-global-tax-on-the-internet/">Elon Musk has dubbed a &#8220;defacto global tax on the Internet&#8221;</a>.)</p>
<p>Separately, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">CMA is investigating Apple&#8217;s App Store</a> following complaints from developers of unfair terms &#8212; although that investigation is taking place under current U.K. competition rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The regulator also has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">ongoing intervention related to Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposals</a>; aka the latter&#8217;s plan to deprecate Chrome&#8217;s support for tracking cookies and switch to alternative ad targeting technologies &#8212; which has raised the ire of advertisers worried the move will further increase Google&#8217;s market power. And the CMA is in the midst of consulting on accepting a set of commitments from Google which would include a monitoring trustee in a bid to reassure the wider market that it&#8217;s playing fair.</p>
<p>At the same time as this ongoing antitrust oversight of digital giants, the U.K. has an in-train plan to update competition rules &#8212; that&#8217;s aimed at addressing the market muscle of big tech. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Specifically, ministers want to intervene to boost competition &#8212; proposing to tackle platform power through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">bespoke ex ante rules for tech giants</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">this major &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition</a>&#8221; digital reboot is still waiting the required legislation to get going. </span></p>
<p>As it waits for new powers to tackle platform power, the CMA has been busy enhancing its understanding of digital market dynamics. And, indeed, familiarizing itself with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">usual tech giant talking points</a> vis-à-vis charges of monopolistic/anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>It also, of course, continues to hand down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">orders</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both firms argue that many of these controls are needed to maintain the security and quality of the overall service to their users, and in some cases to safeguard users’ personal information,&#8221; the regulator writes now, anticipating push-back to its early mobile duopoly conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA agrees that these considerations are very important but is concerned that Apple and Google are making decisions on these grounds that favour their own services and limit meaningful choice, when other approaches are available,&#8221; it warns.</p>
<p>Potential remedies for tackling anti-competitive behavior by the mobile duopoly considered in the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making it easier for users to switch between iOS and Android phones when they want to replace their device without losing functionality or data.</li>
<li>Making it easier to install apps through methods other than the App Store or Play Store, including so-called “web apps”.</li>
<li>Enabling all apps to give users a choice of how they pay in-app for things like game credits or subscriptions, rather than being tied to Apple’s and Google’s payment systems.</li>
<li>Making it easier for users to choose alternatives to Apple and Google for services like browsers, in particular by making sure they can easily set which browser they have as default.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CMA is consulting on its initial findings &#8212; it&#8217;s soliciting market feedback by February 7, 2022.</p>
<p>Apple and Google were contacted for a response to the<a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-ecosystems-market-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> study</a>. (See the base of this post for their remarks.)</p>
<p>Any actual U.K. antitrust intervention over the mobile duopoly looks to be on ice while the CMA waits for the competition reboot to kick in. And, specifically, for legislation to empower the Digital Markets Unit (DMU), which will be responsible for overseeing key parts of the incoming regime.</p>
<p>Although, in further remarks today, the CMA writes that its &#8220;work so far suggests&#8221; both Apple and Google would &#8220;meet the incoming criteria for ‘Strategic Market Status’ (SMS) designation for several of their ecosystem activities&#8221;.</p>
<p>Under the reform, SMS is the bar for ex ante competition interventions to kick in.</p>
<p>But the DMU will be responsible for making a final call on which tech giants meet that threshold. Although the unit (which got going earlier this year) sits within the CMA, and will be drawing on the regulator&#8217;s expertise and past work in the digital sphere, so wildly divergent views seem unlikely.</p>

<p>SMS status will lead to Apple and Google facing &#8220;legally enforceable codes of conduct to govern their behaviour and to prevent them from exploiting their powerful positions&#8221;, the CMA writes now.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this in mind, the CMA’s current view is that the firms’ market power in this area will be best dealt with through the DMU, which the government has recently proposed powers for,&#8221; it goes on, also noting it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-government-proposals-on-new-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awaiting stronger competition and consumer law powers</a> from the government (also recently consulted on).</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s announcement also references the two aforementioned big tech probes, into Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox, with the regulator noting: &#8220;While both examine issues falling within the scope of this study, this work into mobile ecosystems is much broader. The CMA will adopt a joined-up approach across all these related cases, to ensure the best outcomes for customers and other businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also hasn&#8217;t finished its deep dive into the mobile ecosystem: A second half of the study is ongoing, with the CMA expecting to publish a final report in June 2022.</p>
<p>Whether the U.K.&#8217;s competition reboot will have been done and dusted by the middle of next year &#8212; meaning the DMU and CMA would be empowered to take steps to reconfigure the mobile duopoly &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In a public response to the CMA&#8217;s market study, an Apple spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face intense competition in every segment in which we operate, and our North Star is always the trust of our users. We will continue to create new opportunities for developers while protecting our user’s privacy and security.</p>
<p>Our rules and guidelines are constantly evolving, and we have made many recent changes that benefit developers and consumers alike. We will continue to engage constructively with the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority as their work on this study progresses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cupertino also claimed the iOS App Economy in the U.K. supports more than 330,000 jobs.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson also sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps and app stores they use. The Android app ecosystem also supports nearly a quarter of a million jobs across thousands of app developer and phone maker businesses in the UK. At Google we regularly review how we can best support these businesses &#8212; for example &#8212; as a result of recent changes, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. We&#8217;re committed to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers succeed.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is the latest social media platform to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXb7-X1PrQ6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roll out</a> the option to allow users to reply to comments with videos. Users can now do so via the company&#8217;s Idea Pins feature. Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">launched</a> Idea Pins earlier this year to allow creators to record and edit videos with up to 20 pages of content, using tools like voiceover recording, background music, transitions and other interactive elements. Now, when users find a comment they want to respond to, they can select the three dots menu and click &#8220;reply with an Idea Pin.&#8221; From there, you can choose to film a new video or upload an existing one.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are more ways than ever to engage with your community on Pinterest. Now you can respond to all the comments, questions and requests with a tailored Idea Pin reply,&#8221; the company said in an announcement post about the new feature. &#8220;We wanted to spare you and your thumbs from the long, novel-text replies because some things are simply better when shown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch of Pinterest&#8217;s new feature comes a few days after Instagram rolled out a similar one. Late last week, Instagram introduced a “<a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels Visual Replies</a>” feature that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they’ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247135" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the idea for video replies was first made popular by TikTok. The short-form video platform launched video replies last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of the feature, it’s no surprise that Instagram and Pinterest have launched similar features for their own platforms.</p>
<p>Pinterest has launched several new features aimed at creators over the past few months. The company further invested in creator tools and video with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/pinterest-invests-in-creator-tools-with-acquisition-of-video-creation-and-editing-app-vochi/">acquisition of video creation and editing app Vochi</a> for an undisclosed sum. Pinterest also rolled out a new way for users to browse Idea Pin videos in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">a TikTok-like “Watch” tab</a>, where it encouraged participation with $20 million in creator awards.</p>
<p>The launch of these features indicates that Pinterest is interested in trying to reinvent itself for the TikTok era, largely by copying TikTok features and then adding its own twists. Pinterest isn&#8217;t alone in doing so, as TikTok has fueled clones across top social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Snap, Reddit and others.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One argument in favor of SPACs is that it helps younger companies list. Consider this a more extreme example.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Christmas has come early this year in the form of a new SPAC deal. <a href="https://www.infiniteworld.com/">InfiniteWorld</a> announced yesterday it will <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211213005343/en/InfiniteWorld-a-Leading-Metaverse-Infrastructure-Platform-for-Brands-Announces-Plans-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-a-Merger-with-Aries-I-Acquisition-Corporation">merge</a> with <a href="https://www.ariescorp.io/">Aries I Acquisition Corporation</a> in a deal that will value the startup at around $700 million, per company calculations.</p>
<p>Another day, another SPAC deal. We know. But this time we&#8217;re talking metaverse, so we have no choice but to take a look.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In the wake of Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">deciding</a> that its original product remit was too narrow, something solved by declaring itself a metaverse company, the phrase has been inescapable. The metaverse might be a somewhat squidgy term &#8212; it&#8217;s something involving <em>digital, community, commerce </em>and<em> having a second online existence</em> &#8212; but it&#8217;s hot around the tech world.</p>
<p>That makes it unsurprising that a company working on the theme has found a blank-check company willing to merge.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What&#8217;s InfiniteWorld and what does it do? A grand question; I had no idea. Happily, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001841867/000110465921148881/tm2135215d1_ex99-2.htm">investor deck</a> helps a bit.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the deal, what the metaverse company sells, and then discuss its somewhat humorous financial projections. To say that InfiniteWorld is a nascent commercial enterprise is an understatement, and in a world where many crypto companies are scaling to huge revenues, it stands out as a low-income concern.</p>
<p>To date, that is. InfiniteWorld has huge projections. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>The deal</h2>
<p>Infinite Assets, Inc., better known as InfiniteWorld, is merging with Aries I Acquisition Corporation. Aries I is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;RAM.&#8221; As of this morning, the company is trading at roughly $10 per share, having regained modest lost ground since its midyear IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The four years that Apex.ai spent rewriting — and then safety certifying — the robot operating system to give automakers and other mobility companies a toolkit to integrate software applications into vehicles has paid off.</p>
<p>The startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic has attracted a number of new strategic and private investors, including suppliers Continental and ZF in a Series B $56.5 million fundraising round led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures and others participated in the round. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. Notably, ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex.</p>
<p>Investor appetite for companies like Apex has increased, as with the development of autonomous vehicles, and as the automotive industry has sought to build so-called &#8220;software-defined&#8221; vehicles that can deliver to drivers and passengers digital services capable of updating the software wirelessly — like a smartphone. As vehicles have become more complex, demand for a safety certified software development kit grows. Or at least that is what Apex and its many investors are betting on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Apex.AI has cornered a unique market by making it easier for manufacturers to implement safety-critical software into mobility systems,&#8221; said Ahmed Sallam, partner at Orillion, who is also joining the board. &#8220;We also invested in Apex.ai because we see significant potential to expand the market for their operating system beyond the automotive industry and into other markets such as agriculture, robotics and internet of things (IoT).&#8221;</p>
<p>Apex.ai has focused on giving automakers and mobility companies a way to seamlessly and safely integrate software applications into vehicles. The startup, which has offices in Palo Alto, Berlin, Stuttgart and Munich, have developed two products. Apex.OS is a software development kit for autonomous driving software and other safety-critical mobility applications. Apex.OS received certification earlier this year by the TÜV NORD for functional safety according to the highest level of ISO 26262. This means the software is verified to be used in production vehicles, which expands the market potential for Apex.ai.</p>
<p>More recently, the company has been working on an enterprise middleware product, called Apex.middleware, that integrates various protocols to improve communication between software applications.</p>
<p>The fresh capital will be used to ramp up Apex in just about every way possible. Becker told TechCrunch the company plans to double its workforce from about 70 today to 140 by the end of next year, expand into Asia and commercialize its existing products and develop new ones in areas adjacent to the automotive industry, including agriculture, mining, industrial automation and internet of things (IoT). Former Panasonic executive Tavis Szeto will lead the Asia expansion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, e-commerce company Big Cartel&#8217;s co-founders Matt Wigham and Eric Turner voluntarily recognized the Big Cartel Workers Union. After the new year, the union &#8212; which represents all 30 non-management employees at the Salt Lake City-based tech company &#8212; will begin negotiating their contracts. This news comes just nine months after workers at the software company Glitch signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/following-unionization-glitch-signs-collective-bargaining-agreement/">the tech industry&#8217;s first</a> collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Big Cartel Workers Union will be represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Tech Workers Union Local 1010, the same group that represents unions at </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">Kickstarter</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cfaworkersunited.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for America</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that the founders of Big Cartel want this union to be successful, and they see how all of our values line up,&#8221; said Andrew Shaw, who has worked in marketing for two years at Big Cartel. &#8220;I expect the bargaining can go pretty smoothly and quickly and continue to be a good example of how unionizing can go forward in a tech company in an amicable way.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Often, unionization pushes are spurred by a particular moment of crisis. But in the case of Big Cartel, the movement to unionize stemmed from a desire to simply affirm and uphold workplace protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really building protections around the things in our working conditions that we value, so ensuring that our pay is solid and equitable across genders, races and teams within the company, and making sure that our benefits are more guaranteed than they are now without a contract. We&#8217;re interested in more transparency and more participation in the decision-making processes for the company,&#8221; Shaw told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Big Cartel Workers Union will also be the first tech union in a &#8220;right-to-work&#8221; state. Twenty-seven states, according to the OPEIU, have &#8220;right-to-work&#8221; laws, which prohibit union security agreements between employers and unions. This means that no employee can be forced to join a union or pay union dues, but sometimes, these policies can make it <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more difficult</a> for employees to form unions in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;So often in these companies, benefits just kind of come up [in conversation], or there has to be an individual conflict in order for you to work out some of these details,&#8221; Shaw said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see that we can have these conversations without having to begin with a conflict, or without having to feel like it&#8217;s an urgent crisis moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Right now, workers at video game company Activision Blizzard are experiencing their own &#8220;urgent crisis moment.&#8221; This summer, the developer of games like &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221; and &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/22/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> by state labor regulators for discriminatory workplace practices, and in September, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">confirmed</a> it is being investigated by the SEC. Since then, over a thousand workers at Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a petition</a> to remove CEO Bobby Kotrick, who reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered up</a> sexual assault allegations in the workplace. Last week, a group called <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Better ABK</a> initiated an open-ended strike and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/activision-blizzard-workers-announce-open-ended-strike-and-union-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a union drive</a> &#8212; already, executives have asked employees to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consider the consequences</a>&#8221; of joining a union.</p>
<p>But even in less extreme cases, the road can be rocky for tech workers who are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">starting to unionize.</a> When Kickstarter employees <a href="https://www.opeiu.org/Home/NewsandMedia/TabId/2838/ArtMID/4815/ArticleID/1784/Kickstarter-Refuses-Employees%E2%80%99-Request-to-Recognize-Union.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formed a union</a> in 2019, the crowdfunding company&#8217;s leadership refused to voluntarily recognize the unit. When management doesn&#8217;t recognize a workers&#8217; union, the organizers must conduct an election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) &#8212; in the case of the Kickstarter union, this process took 10 months before they ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">voted to unionize</a>.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, workers at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/controversial-crime-app-citizen-launches-20-month-protect-service/">controversial</a> crime-tracking app Citizen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/citizen-app-workers-vote-to-unionize-fearing-outsourcing-moves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to unionize</a> over a year after unionization efforts began. Earlier this year, a spokesperson for Citizen<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/04/citizen-app-workers-push-to-form-union-as-company-blasts-outside-meddling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> told the New York Post</a> that the company opposed the union drive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely inspired by our comrades at Code for America and Kickstarter,&#8221; Shaw told TechCrunch. &#8220;We want others to be inspired by the work that we&#8217;re doing because we want to make sure that not just the 30 people here at Big Cartel are protected, but that workers across all industries and across all companies are protected and treated fairly.&#8221;</p>
