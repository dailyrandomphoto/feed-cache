										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A four-year antitrust investigation into PC games geo-blocking in the European Union by distribution platform Valve and five games publishers has led to fines totalling €7.8 million (~$9.4M) after the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_170">confirmed today</a> that the bloc&#8217;s rules had been breached.</p>
<p>The geo-blocking practices investigated since 2017 concerned around 100 PC video games of different genres, including sports, simulation and action games.</p>
<p>In addition to Valve &#8212; which has been fined just over €1.6M &#8212; the five sanctioned games publishers are: Bandai Namco (fined €340k), Capcom (€396k), Focus Home (€2.8M), Koch Media (€977k) and ZeniMax (€1.6M).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission said the fines were reduced by between 10% and 15% owing to cooperation from the companies, with the exception of Valve who it said chose not to cooperate (a &#8220;prohibition Decision&#8221; rather than a fine reduction was applied in its case).</p>
<p>Valve has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>The antitrust investigation begun in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/europe-opens-antitrust-geo-blocking-probe-into-valve-others/">February 2017</a>, with a formal statement of objections issued just over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">two years later</a> when the Commission accused the companies of &#8220;entering into bilateral agreements to prevent consumers from purchasing and using PC video games acquired elsewhere than in their country of residence&#8221; in contravention of EU rules.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/embed/#?secret=JvHGT3Bpna" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The mechanisms used by the companies to prevent certain cross-border sales of certain PC games were geo-blocked Steam activation keys and bilateral licensing and distribution agreements to restrict certain cross-border sales.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers has now found that these business practices partitioned certain European markets according to national borders &#8212; denying regional consumers the benefits of the EU&#8217;s Digital Single Market to shop around for the best offer.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up competition policy for the bloc, said: “Today&#8217;s sanctions against the &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales. Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to the Commission&#8217;s investigation, geo-blocking of Steam activation keys prevented activation of certain of the five games&#8217; publishers titles outside of Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>It said agreements between the companies to geo-block activation keys had lasted between one and five years and were found to have been implemented at various times between September 2010 and October 2015.</p>
<p>While four of the games publishers (not Capcom) were found to have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with various PC games distributors (not Value) in the European Economic Area (EEA) which contained clauses which restricted cross-border sales of the affected titles within the EEA, including the aforementioned Central and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>The Commission said these agreements lasted generally longer (&#8220;between three and 11 years&#8221;), and were implemented at different times between March 2007 and November 2018.</p>
<p>Since the investigation started, EU lawmakers have passed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/at-last-an-end-to-geoblocking-in-europe-nope-not-by-a-long-chalk/">regulation against unjustified geo-blocking</a>. Although the legislation only applies to PC video games distributed on CDs or DVDs, not to downloads. So games are only partially covered.</p>
<p>A Commission review of how the geo-blocking regulation is operating, published <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">last November</a>, discussed a possible extension of its scope in a range of areas, including for games. However it did not make a strong case for that change. (It also found d<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">emand for cross-border access to games (and software generally) relatively low vs </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">other content services.)</span></p>
<p>But while games distributed via digital downloads look set to remain outside the scope of the EU&#8217;s unjustified geo-blocking regulation, the fines against Valve et al show that geo-blocking can still be a legal minefield as contractual agreements to restrict cross-border sales run counter to the bloc&#8217;s antitrust rules.</p>
<p>The specific breaches are of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101">Article 101</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area which prohibit agreements between companies that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU&#8217;s Single Market, per the Commission.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab has launched its 18th mission, and the first of 2021, as of 8:26 PM NZT (2:30 AM EST). The &#8216;Another One Leaves The Crust&#8217; mission took off from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, and flew a single communications microsatellite on behalf of client OHB Group, a satellite manufacturer based in Europe with facilities in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s launches often feature payloads from more than one customer on the same Electron launch vehicle, but this dedicated payload launch is an example of how the flexibility of its smaller rocket can serve customers even for single small satellite missions. The rocket successfully delivered its payload as intended shortly following take-off.</p>
<p>While Rocket Lab has been developing and testing a booster stage recovery process to help it re-use part of its launch vehicles on subsequent flights, this particular mission did not include a recovery attempt. The company has had significant success with that development process however, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">recovered its first booster last year</a>. Sometime this year, it&#8217;s expected to attempt a recovery that includes a mid-air catch of the returning first stage via helicopter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hipeople.io/">HiPeople</a>, a HR tech startup based in Berlin that wants to automate the reference checking process, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/mattias-ljungman-leaving-atomico/">Mattias Ljungman’s Moonfire</a>, with participation from Capnamic Ventures, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/cherry-ventures-iii/">Cherry Ventures</a>. It follows a $1.1 million pre-seed in late 2019. Notably, the seed round was closed fully remote, without any in-person meetings. “Just like the hiring processes of HiPeople&#8217;s clients,” founders Jakob Gillmann and Sebastian Schüller told me in an email.</p>
<p>HiPeople says the investment will be used to support growth so that more recruiters can hire remotely using automated reference checks. Longer term, the company is developing a candidate analytics platform to provide rich data and insights on each candidate and enable what it frames as &#8220;data-driven&#8221; hiring.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Abstractly-speaking HiPeople is in the talent insights business,” say Gillmann and Schüller. “It’s mission is to enable better hiring by automatically collecting and analyzing talent data, and providing rich insights. HiPeople currently solves this by automating candidate reference checks from request, to collection, and analysis. This allows companies to extend the information they have on a candidate without additional manual work”.</p>
<p>The idea behind the software-as-a-service is that HiPeople’s approach creates a seamless user experience for the recruiter, and “verified, in-depth reference checks they can trust”. As a result, the startup claims that its users on average collect 2x the amount of references on a candidate, in 50% of the time. “Traditionally, reference checks are underutilized due to the highly manual process, and often only exclusively used for executive hiring. HiPeople dusts off reference checks, and enables rich talent insights by rethinking how they are done,” says HiPeople’s founders.</p>
<p>HiPeople’s customers span fast growing startups to tech scale-ups and more established upper mid-market companies. For example, process mining company Celonis, which doubled its workforce in the last 12 months to 1,200 employees globally, uses HiPeople to improve hiring quality for roles in San Francisco, Munich and Tokyo. “By programmatically conducting reference checks the company hires talent based on verified insights on topics like areas of improvement, skills, teamwork style, or work values,” explains HiPeople.</p>
<p>Adds Moonfire’s Mattias Ljungman: “Workflow automation of repetitive processes, and insights on the candidate that go beyond the limitations of the CV, are a clear pain for anybody in recruiting. The Covid-influenced reality of remote work, hence remote hiring practices, has increased the complexity of finding the right talent. HiPeople created a way to enable anybody who is hiring to make better decisions, whilst improving processes and increasing hiring velocity”.</p>
<p>Gillmann and Schüller tell me that in Europe, HiPeople mainly competes with the existing infrastructure and processes recruiters use to manually conduct references checks. In the U.S., companies like Xref or Crosschq are more direct competitors in terms of automating reference checks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba&#8217;s billionaire founder resurfaced as he spoke to 100 rural teachers through a video call, three months after his last public appearance in October, sending the e-commerce firm&#8217;s shares up more than 8% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A recording of the call was first posted on a <a href="https://tm.zjol.com.cn/interface/getNews?id=271099&amp;doc_type=9">news portal</a> backed by the government of Zhejiang, the eastern province where Alibaba is headquartered, and the video was verified by an Alibaba spokesperson.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/jack-ma-missing/">Speculations swirled around Ma&#8217;s whereabouts</a> after media reported in December that he skipped the taping of a TV program he created. Ma, known for his love for the limelight, has seen his e-commerce empire Alibaba and fintech giant Ant Group increasingly in the crosshairs of the Chinese authorities in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma last appeared publicly at a conference where he castigated China&#8217;s financial regulatory system in front of a room of high-ranked officials. His controversial remark, according to reports, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">prompted the Chinese regulator to abruptly halt</a> Ant&#8217;s initial public offering, which would have been the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/ant-group-could-raise-as-much-as-34-5b-in-ipo-in-what-would-be-worlds-largest-ipo/">biggest public share sale of all time</a>.</p>
<p>Ant has since been working on corporate restructuring and regulatory compliance under the directions of the government. Alibaba, China&#8217;s largest e-commerce platform, also came under scrutiny as market regulators opened an investigation into its alleged monopolistic practices.</p>
<p>Some argue that the recent clampdown on Jack Ma&#8217;s internet empire signals Beijing&#8217;s growing unease with the country&#8217;s super-rich and private-sector power brokers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Alibaba and its archrival, Tencent, control more personal data and are more intimately involved in everyday life in China than Google, Facebook and other American tech titans are in the United States. And just like their American counterparts, the Chinese giants sometimes bully smaller competitors and kill innovation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/technology/china-jack-ma-alibaba.html">wrote</a> Li Yuan for the New York Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don’t have to be a member of the Communist Party to see reasons to rein them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 50-second clip, Ma is seen talking directly into the camera against what appears to be decorative paintings depicting a water town typical of Zhejiang. An art history book is shown amid a stack of books, alongside a vase of fresh flowers and a ceramic figurine of a stout, reclining man who looks relaxed and content.</p>
<p>Ma addressed the 100 teachers receiving the Jack Ma Rural Teachers Award, which was set up by the Jack Ma Foundation to identify outstanding rural teachers every year. It&#8217;s unclear where Ma was speaking from, but the video briefly shows him visiting a rural boarding school in Zhejiang on January 10. The award ceremony was moved online this year due to the pandemic, Ma told the award recipients.</p>
<p>When Ma announced his retirement plan, he pledged to return to his teaching roots and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/jack-ma-officially-retires-as-alibabas-chairman/">devote more time to education philanthropy</a>, though the founder still holds considerable sway over Alibaba by keeping a seat in the powerful <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/governance_9">Alibaba Partnership</a>. The legendary billionaire began his career as an English teacher in Hangzhou, and on Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent, he nicknames himself the &#8220;ambassador for rural teachers.&#8221;</p>

<p>We last chatted to Landbot back in 2018 when it raised a $2.2M seed and had 900+ customers. It&#8217;s grown that to ~2,200 paying customers, with some 50,000 individuals now using its tool (across both free and paid accounts).</p>
<p>Since its seed it&#8217;s also increased recurrent revenues 10x &#8212; and is expecting growth to keep stepping up, fuelled by the new financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It says the coronavirus pandemic has supercharged demand for conversational landing pages as all sorts of businesses look for ways to automate higher volumes of digitally inbound customer comms, without needing to make major investments in in-house IT.</p>
<p>Landbot&#8217;s customers range from SMEs to specific teams and products within larger organisations, with the startup name-checking the likes of Nestlé, MediaMarkt, CocaCola, Cepsa, PcComponentes and Prudential among its customer roster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing strong traction from industries like eCommerce, Financial Services and Marketing Agencies,&#8221; CEO &amp; co-founder Jiaqi Pan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The ecommerce segment is one we have seen the most growth in since COVID-19, where we increased 2x the number of customers <span aria-invalid="grammar">from ecommerce</span> industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to double Landbot&#8217;s team during 2021 (currently it employs 40 people) &#8212; with hiring planned across sales, marketing and engineering.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its &#8216;no code&#8217; flavor of chatbot builder back in 2017, previously relocated HQ from Valencia to Barcelona to help with recruitment.</p>
<p>Since Landbot&#8217;s launch, the burgeoning &#8216;no code/low code&#8217; movement has become a fully fledged trend driven by demand for productivity- and lead-boosting digital services outstripping most businesses&#8217; supply of expert in-house techies able to build stuff.</p>
<p>Hence the rise of service-builder tools that make customizable tech capabilities accessible to non-technical staff.</p>
<p>The pandemic has merely poured more fuel on this fire &#8212; and low-friction tools like Landbot are clearly reaping the rewards.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as well as competing with other conversational chatbot builders, like San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/manychat">ManyChat</a>, Landbot says it&#8217;s seeing traction from customers who are seeking to replace web forms with more engaging chat interfaces.</p>
<p>Its drag-and-drop chatbot builder tool supports information workers to design what Landbot bills as &#8220;an immersive web page experience filled with gifs and visual elements to capture the attention of the end-user&#8221; &#8212; so you can understand the appeal for SMEs to be able to replace their boring old static forms with an experience any smartphone user is familiar with from using messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of the main competitor in the no-code space, we have some overlap with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/manychat-series-a/">ManyChat</a> as the most direct competitor for Chatbot. On the other hand, as we have a lot of customers using us to replace their forms we are competing also against form builders like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a>,&#8221; says Pan, the latter another Barcelona-based startup which similarly bills itself as a platform for &#8220;conversational&#8221; and &#8220;interactive&#8221; data collection.</p>
<p>Landbot notes it recently acquired India-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/morph-ai">Morph.AI</a>, a chat-based marketing automation tool, which it&#8217;s using to help convert social, website and ad traffic into leads &#8212; also with the aim of further expanding into presence in the Asian market.</p>
<p>To date, 90% of its customers are international, with 60% coming from the U.S., U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Juan Revuelta, general partner of Swanlaab, said: “The beauty of Landbot is in the drag and drop solution of the product. The simplicity is critical to making this product accessible to everyone across many different types of business. If you’re a small company you don’t have the luxury of time or money to solve issues in customer service or run lavish marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Landbot helps all businesses to have truly frictionless conversations with customers and exchange the data they need to make smarter decisions and scale. The team has had a remarkable 2020, and we’re excited to support them in helping more businesses this year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer and serial entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/anthony-levandowski-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-as-new-4b-lawsuit-against-uber-is-filed/">who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison</a> on one count of stealing trade secrets, has received a pardon from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The full pardon, which was one of 73 issued late Tuesday evening, means Levandowski will avoid a prison cell. The president also commuted 70 sentences. Levandowski received his sentence in August 2020. However, Judge Alsup, who presided over the case, said he didn&#8217;t need to report to prison until the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family and I are grateful for the opportunity to move forward, and thankful to the President and others who supported and advocated on my behalf,&#8221; Levandowski told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Anthony Levandowski sentenced to 18 months in prison as new $4B lawsuit against Uber is filed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/anthony-levandowski-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-as-new-4b-lawsuit-against-uber-is-filed/embed/#?secret=IIyaJsUjuf" data-secret="IIyaJsUjuf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Levandowski&#8217;s pardon was supported by technology founders and investors, including Founders Fund&#8217;s co-founder Peter Thiel and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey;  trial lawyers Miles Ehrlich and Amy Craig; and businessman and investor Michael Ovitz. Other people connected to Thiel organizations also supported Levandowski, including Trae Stephens, partner at Founders Fund and Blake Masters, who is COO at Thiel Capital and president of The Thiel Foundation.</p>
<p>Here is the full description, which includes people who supported the pardon, that was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/">posted by the White House</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anthony Levandowski &#8212; President Trump granted a full pardon to Anthony Levandowski. This pardon is strongly supported by James Ramsey, Peter Thiel, Miles Ehrlich, Amy Craig, Michael Ovitz, Palmer Luckey, Ryan Petersen, Ken Goldberg, Mike Jensen, Nate Schimmel, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and James Proud, among others. Mr. Levandowski is an American entrepreneur who led Google&#8217;s efforts to create self-driving technology. Mr. Levandowski pled guilty to a single criminal count arising from civil litigation. Notably, his sentencing judge called him a &#8220;brilliant, groundbreaking engineer that our country needs.&#8221; Mr. Levandowski has paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levandowski has been a polarizing figure in the autonomous vehicle industry. He is by all accounts — even among some of his harshest critics — a brilliant engineer. His bravado and risk-taking combined with a likable, even affable personality won him followers and rivals.</p>
<p>He has been vilified as a thieving tech bro, unceremoniously ejected from Uber, and forced into bankruptcy by a $179 million award against him. He has also been heralded as a star engineer who was an early pioneer of autonomous vehicles. Levandowski was one of the founding members in 2009 of the Google self-driving project, which was internally called Project Chauffeur. He was rewarded handsomely  — about $127 million by Google — for his work on Project Chauffeur, according to the court documents.</p>
<p>The criminal case that led to Levandowski’s sentencing in August is part of a multi-year legal saga that has entangled Levandowksi, Uber and Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet.</p>
<p>In 2016, Levandowski left Google and started Otto with three other Google veterans:<a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lior-ron"> Lior Ron,</a> Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later. Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn’t a party to either arbitration. However, under the indemnification agreement between Uber and Levandowski, the company was compelled to defend him.</p>
<p>While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, Uber agreed to not incorporate Waymo’s confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That calculated at the time to about $244.8 million in Uber equity.</p>
<p>While Levandowski wasn&#8217;t a defendant in the Waymo v Uber suit, he would soon face a bigger obstacle.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the U.S. District Attorney charged Levandowski alone with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets while working at Google. Levandowski and the U.S. District Attorney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/anthony-levandowski-pleads-guilty-to-one-count-of-trade-secrets-theft-under-plea-deal/"> reached a plea deal</a> in March 2020. Under that agreement, Levandowski admitted to downloading thousands of files related to Project Chauffeur. Specifically, he pleaded guilty to count 33 of the indictment, which is related to taking what was known as the Chauffeur Weekly Update, a spreadsheet that contained a variety of details including quarterly goals and weekly metrics as well as summaries of 15 technical challenges faced by the program and notes related to previous challenges that had been overcome.</p>
<p>The U.S. District Attorney’s office had recommended a 27-month sentence. Levandowski had sought a fine, 12 months home confinement and 200 hours of community service. Alsup ultimately determined that home confinement would &#8220;[give] a green light to every future brilliant engineer to steal trade secrets. Prison time is the answer to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Alsup sentenced Lewandowski to 18 months, but delayed his prison time until the pandemic was under control. Levandowski also agreed to pay $756,499.22 in restitution to Waymo and a fine of $95,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, the 14-year-old, Toronto-based, venture-backed storytelling platform with reach into a number of verticals, is being acquired by Naver, the South Korean conglomerate, in a $600 million cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Naver plans to incorporate at least part of the business into another of its holdings, the publishing platform <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon</a>, which Naver launched in 2004, brought to the U.S. in 2014, and that features thousands of comic strips created by its users. It also has a huge audience. According to Naver, Webtoon was averaging more than <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">67 million monthly users</a> as of last August.</p>
<p>On its face, the deal appears to make sense. According to Korea&#8217;s Pulse News, some of the region&#8217;s webtoons are finding a broader geographic audience and <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">crossing over into film</a>. (Below is a trailer for one popular series called &#8220;The Secret of Angel.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, Wattpad, which originally launched as an e-reading app, has evolved into a highly popular platform where users publish their original work and more than 90 million people visit monthly to read them. (Indeed, according to a story published last week in the Verge, Wattpad has published more than a billion stories over the years,  and it claims its users spend a collective <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22215052/wattpad-authors-fanfiction-netflix-hulu-streaming-movies-romcom-teen-drama">22 billion minutes per month</a> reading these.)</p>
<p>Like Webtoon, Wattpad has been more focused on streaming media, given the many platforms now needing fresh content, from Netflix to Apple to farther flung outfits, like GoJek&#8217;s GoPlay, launched by the Indonesian ride-hailing giant in 2019. (In addition to <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">Wattpad Studios</a>, Wattpad also launched a book <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">publishing division</a> in 2019.)</p>
<p>CEO Jun Koo Kim of Webtoon said in a press release about the new tie-up that it represents a &#8220;big step towards us becoming a leading global multimedia entertainment company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CEO Seong-Sook Han of Naver &#8212; a search engine giant whose properties include the popular Tokyo-based messaging app Line &#8212; said in a separate release that Wattpad co-founders Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen will continue to lead the company they have built post-acquisition.</p>
<p>As for whether the acquisition is a win for Wattpad&#8217;s investors, it appears to be a moderate one. (It&#8217;s hard to discern much without knowing the terms under which each outfit invested.)</p>
<p>Wattpaid had raised $117.8 million from investors in Asia, the United States, and Canada over the years and closed its most recent round with $51 million from Tencent Holdings, BDC, Globe Telecom’s Kickstart Ventures, Peterson Group, Canso, and Raine Ventures.</p>
<p>That last deal, announced in 2018, assigned the company a post-money valuation of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/"> $398 million according to Pitchbook</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve spent more time than I care to mention over the last several years wondering aloud about the value of in-person trade shows. There’s something seemingly antiquated in the idea of jamming a bunch of people in a room, walking from booth to booth. Sure, they’ve fulfilled an important need in the past, but aren’t they just a relic in this hyperconnected world?</p>
<p>I’ve always assumed that if trade shows were to go extinct, it would be a gradual process &#8212; a slow fade into cultural irrelevance, like bookstores and record stores (both things I miss dearly). Technology has, for many intents and purposes, dramatically reduced their relative value to our society.</p>
<p>While it’s undoubtedly true that Spotify and the Kindle Store are lacking in much of the appeal and all of the charm of their real-world counterparts, we’re happy to sacrifice all that and more at the alter of convenience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A rampaging pandemic has effectively given us a year without in-person trade shows. That means, among other things, we’ve had a much more immediate control variable in this question about trade shows. Last year’s CES managed to get in just under the wire. The next major consumer electronics show &#8212; Mobile World Congress &#8212; was eventually canceled after much hand-wringing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pHHD1DQ7eM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/">GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concerns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/embed/#?secret=pHHD1DQ7eM" data-secret="pHHD1DQ7eM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The CTA (the governing body behind CES) appeared to have been planning a scaled-back in-person version of the show this year, following a similar move by the team behind the Berlin-based IFA over the summer. By July, however, it was clear that such a plan was untenable. To put it bluntly, the United States didn’t have its shit together when it comes to keeping this virus in check (I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we just hit 400,000 deaths on the day I’m writing this).</p>
<p>CES 2021 was far from the first tech show to go all virtual over this past year. The size and scope of the event, on the other hand, are relatively unique here. Per the CTA, the 2020 show drew north of 170,000 attendees. The majority of the tech events I’ve attended virtually in the past year have been put on by a single company. CES is obviously a different beast entirely.</p>
<p>The CTA’s (nee CEA) role in the industry certainly afforded it a fair bit of goodwill up front. The show, after all, dates back to the late-60s. It has ebbed and flowed over the years (taking hits from external forces like the 2008 financial crisis), but it has remained a constant. Those of us who’ve been doing this for a while tend to face the show with equal parts anticipation and dread. But the companies always come out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Per the CTA’s numbers, nearly 2,000 companies launched products at the 2021 event. The figure pales in comparison to the 4,419 companies exhibiting last year, but that’s to be expected. In addition to the uncertain nature of the event, it’s been a remarkably crappy year for plenty of companies. I certainly had my questions and doubts going in &#8212; chief among them was the value of an event like this for a startup? Without an in-person element, wasn’t this just yet another chance to get lost in the noise?</p>
<p>I heard similar feedback from startups on the side, though ultimately nearly 700 chose to exhibit at the show. I know because I ended up going through all of them for the purposes of our coverage. It brought back a kind of visceral memory of the year I challenged myself to walk every square inch of the show, and ended up being challenging for entirely different reasons.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this was the element I missed the most. For me, CES’s biggest appeal has been the element of discovery. Eureka Park, the jam-packed startup portion of the show at the Sands Expo, is easily the best part. The vast majority of exhibitors are not for us, but I still get a charge stumbling on something new and innovative I’ve not seen before. The blogger instinct that lives dormant inside kicks in and I can’t wait to get back in front of my laptop to tell the world.</p>
<p>There was no Eureka Park this year &#8212; not even a virtual version. There’s just no good way to approximate a show floor online &#8212; at least none that I’m aware of. A couple of existing contacts offered to send me stuff in the mail to look out. Sensel, for instance, has a new version of its trackpad (which it announced today will be integrated into Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad). But for obvious reasons, it’s just not possible to get all 700 startups to send review units to my one-bedroom in Queens.</p>
<p>More than anything, the virtual event highlighted the technology limitations of an event at this scale. Press conferences are simple enough (though I found frustration in the various different platforms the CTA employed). More often than not, these felt like lengthy commercials for the exhibiting company. The in-person versions are, as well, of course, but we tend to be blinded by the spectacle. For my own purposes, there just wasn’t a lot that that couldn’t have been accomplished more efficiently with a press release.</p>
<p>The nature of news releases was far more nebulous this year. More companies seemingly took liberties by dumping their news well ahead of the show. Other companies offered their own sort of counter programming. One of the biggest advantages to these events when it comes to my own peace of mind is how they regulate the news flow. I know going into the year that there’s going to be one hair-pullingly difficult week at the beginning of the year where a ton of news is announced.</p>
<p>With CES less of a center of gravity this year, I anticipated seeing a less segmented news flow. I’ve commented to colleagues over the last couple of years that there’s “no more slow season” when it comes to hardware news, and this will likely only increase that sentiment. Obviously there’s upside in having things more evenly spread out, but I’ve got the feeling we’re moving toward something more akin to a series of small CES-like events throughout the year, and the thought makes my blood turn cold.</p>

<p>It’s been clear in recent years that companies would rather break out from the noise of CES in favor of their own events, following in Apple’s footsteps. Virtual events are a perfect opportunity to adopt that approach. Apple, meanwhile, moved from one event to a series of one smaller event every month toward the end of the year. When you’re not asking people to fly across the country or world to attend an event, the bar for what qualifies as news lowers considerably. Perhaps instead of having thousands of companies vying for our attention at one event, we’re moving toward a model in which there are instead thousands of events. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>I have some hyper-specific grievances about the CTA’s format, but I’ll save them for the post-event survey that I may or may not get around to filling out. I still found value in the virtual event. It was an excuse to talk to a bunch of startups I wasn’t familiar with. Ultimately, however, I think the event served as a testament to the fact that as much as we bemoan all of the headaches and head colds that come with an event like CES, there’s still a lot of value to be had in the in-person event.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the CTA and the rest of these sorts of organizations are champing at the bit to return to in-person events, even as a bumpy vaccine rollout leaves a big question mark around the expected timeline. There’s a very good chance that we’ll view 2020/2021 as the beginning of the end for the in-person trade show. But given the sorts of limitations we’ve seen in the past year, I’m not ready to declare them fully dead any time soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decentralized tech community is aiming to find support for technologies that go beyond cryptocurrency support.</p>
<p>In a blog post today the team at Brave <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">announced</a> that they have worked with Protocol Labs to integrate native support for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) inside their browser. The peer-to-peer file-sharing standard launched in 2015 and has been gathering support among open-source advocates who laud the protocol&#8217;s ability to stop companies and government bodies from taking down content across the web, as well as the more functional performance improvements, offline file-viewing capabilities and underlying reliability.</p>
<p>IPFS shares plenty of similarities with BitTorrent and allows files to be hosted by a multitude of users distributed across networks. With the update, Brave users will be able to access content from web addresses starting with <em>ipfs://</em> and will be able to host an IPFS node themselves. The company says that adding support for IPFS will help improve &#8220;the overall resilience of the Internet.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why The Internet Needs IPFS Before It&#8217;s Too Late&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/embed/#?secret=I8YcqmtsFz" data-secret="I8YcqmtsFz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave is a likely home for the IPFS protocol given the company&#8217;s affinity for all things decentralized. The startup founded by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich says it now has 24 million monthly active users. Some of Brave&#8217;s most unique features have involved blockchain or peer-to-peer tech. In 2018, Brave announced a beta of Tor Tabs bringing the decentralized Onion protocol into the mix.</p>
<p>Last year, Opera <a href="https://press.opera.com/2020/03/30/opera-introduces-major-updates-to-its-blockchain-browser-on-android/">announced</a> that it was bringing limited support for IPFS to its Android application.</p>
<p>Decentralization tech is finding more mainstream interest as tech companies have slowly warmed up to the opportunities in cryptocurrency. Last week, TechCrunch looked into how Twitter was looking to help build out a decentralized network for social media platforms.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this is a technology that more mainstream browsers will opt to support natively, given the clear potential for abuse that exists in allowing users to work around file takedowns and the fact that it is a pretty niche technology for the time being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After two days locked up in an Italian prison, American Max Craddock was finally able to make his case to a judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a weapon of war,&#8221; his lawyer <a href="https://www.lanuovasardegna.it/olbia/cronaca/2018/06/26/news/negli-stati-uniti-e-solo-un-gioco-1.17006714">told the investigating magistrate</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a toy they sell to children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock had been arrested in the Sardinian port city of Olbia in June 2018 after trying to board a private party bus with a collectible flamethrower from Elon Musk&#8217;s latest startup, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/">The Boring Company</a>. Craddock had painted his flamethrower black, and written on it the name of a floating music festival in the Bahamas he had attended the previous year while starring in reality TV show <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/unanchored/season-1/ep-1">Unanchored</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alarmed by the sight of what he thought was a gun, the bus driver refused to drive off, and then called the police.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were very chill at first,&#8221; Craddock told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview. &#8220;But as the night went on, it kept getting worse. I spent the first night in jail in Olbia and then they took me to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Craddock managed to get a lawyer, she told him the judge would probably just let him go with a warning. Instead, the magistrate ordered him back to his cell. That was when Craddock, pictured below, learned possession of a flamethrower in Italy can carry a 10-year prison sentence.</p>

<p>A few months later, author John Richardson was sitting down to work at his home in London when there was a loud knock at the door. He opened it and five police officers barged in wearing tasers and tactical gear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a couple of them also had handguns,&#8221; Richardson told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I&#8217;m slightly hazy on that because my legs went wobbly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police officers sat Richardson down on his sofa and informed him that they had a warrant to search the premises. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on here?&#8217; &#8221; Richardson recalled. &#8220;Then something clicked and I said, &#8216;Is this about the flamethrower?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>The raid was indeed about his flamethrower.</p>
<p>Craddock and Richardson are not the only Boring Company customers to have fallen foul of law enforcement.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 flamethrower purchasers abroad have had their devices confiscated by customs officers or local police, with many facing fines and weapons charges. In the U.S., the flamethrowers have been implicated in at least one local and one federal criminal investigation. There have also been at least three occasions in which the Boring Company devices have been featured in weapons hauls seized from suspected drug dealers.</p>
<p>The upshot: What Musk and his army of fans thought was just another of his money-spinning larks is having real-world consequences for people and countries not in on the joke.</p>
<p>The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions from TechCrunch for this story.</p>
<h2>The spark of an idea</h2>
<p>Inspired by Los Angeles traffic, Musk launched The Boring Company in December 2016. The startup&#8217;s mission was to solve urban traffic jams by moving cars through tiny tunnels. But re-engineering sewer tunneling technology to build a revolutionary subterranean transportation network doesn&#8217;t come cheap. In an effort to drum up awareness and funds, Musk announced in December 2017 a limited run of novelty flamethrowers designed and branded by The Boring Company.</p>
<p>It was a scheme that had produced results earlier that year. Musk raised $1 million just weeks after launching sales of a $20 Boring Company hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie,&#8221; Musk told Joe Rogan during an <a href="https://sonix.ai/resources/full-transcript-joe-rogan-experience-elon-musk/">infamous podcast</a> in 2018. &#8220;They have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs, and, like, the kids love that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device uses a standard propane gas canister and is functionally similar to propane torches for melting ice, killing weeds or applying roofing materials. But with its rifle-style stock, pistol grip and sci-fi styling, the Boring Company&#8217;s flamethrower had a very different aesthetic &#8212; more post-apocalyptic party accessory than everyday yard maintenance.</p>
<p>Musk did his best to hype sales, tweeting to his Twitter followers, which numbered about 22 million at the time: &#8220;Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty &#8216;match&#8217; to ignite!&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1005549006573846528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He also threw a launch party in Los Angeles, where Craddock was one of the first 1,000 customers to collect a flamethrower, just before his European trip. &#8220;I removed the gas canister, put the flamethrower in my carry-on, and had no trouble on the flights,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s influence and the appeal of the product provided a winning combination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no intention of going around setting fire to stuff,&#8221; said Richardson. &#8220;I just thought it looked pretty cool, and was something I could potentially flip for a lot more money down the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Boring Company would make 20,000 flamethrowers and sell them at $500 each, netting the young company $10 million.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Not&#8217; a Flamethrower</h2>
<p>The 20,000 flamethrowers quickly sold out, with orders flooding in from around the world. As the shipping date neared, however, The Boring Company realized its scorching new product could also be a legal hot potato.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers,&#8221; Musk told Rogan in 2018. &#8220;So, to solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labelled it, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower">&#8216;Not a Flamethrower.&#8217; &#8220;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Did it work? Was it effective?&#8221; asked Rogan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think so. Yes,&#8221; Musk replied.</p>
<p>The correct answer was no.</p>

<p>In London, the flamethrower came to the attention of Operation Viper, a rapid response team dedicated to tackling gun crime. Working with customs officials, Viper tracked Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers en route to the nation&#8217;s capital. &#8220;There has been a debate as to whether these are firearms,&#8221; one of the Viper officers wrote in an email to Richardson. &#8220;Similar flamethrowers have been seized right across London.&#8221; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringCompany/comments/9jqx36/i_was_arrested_in_the_uk_for_ordering_a/">One Londoner</a> had his laptop and several cellphones confiscated along with the flamethrower.</p>
<p>Flamethrower raids were also happening around the U.K. and across Europe. A YouTube vlogger in Manchester was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/police-obtain-search-warrant-for-syndicates-home-for-elon-musk-flamethrower-218232/">targeted by police</a> after featuring the Boring Company&#8217;s gadget in one of his videos, while up to <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/not-a-flamethrower-von-elon-musk-spielzeug-oder-waffenimitat-ld.1507777">1,000 purchasers in Switzerland</a> had devices confiscated and were issued fines. One took his case to court, saying the flamethrower was little different from a school Bunsen burner. He lost.</p>
<h2>Not just a European problem</h2>
<p>Without the immediacy of a Customs check, the backlash to Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers in the United States took longer to arrive. But in June 2019, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate introduced a bill that would criminalize owning and using Musk&#8217;s flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Boring Company released a new flamethrower&#8230; without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s1637">reads S1637</a>. &#8220;This bill establishes that owning and using a flamethrower is a criminal act, unless it is used for agricultural, construction or historical collection purposes. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not every police force believes that new laws are necessary &#8212; finding that existing ones are enough. In June 2020, police in Springfield, Massachusetts <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/springfield-flamethrower-brandon-mcgee-elon-musk-the-boring-company/">stopped a car</a> for a missing inspection sticker. One of the officers noticed what he thought was a rifle hidden beneath a seat &#8212; actually a Boring Company flamethrower. Its owner, passenger Brandon McGee, was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon and an &#8220;infernal machine&#8221; (a device for endangering life or property using fire).</p>
<p>The same month, FBI agents executing a search warrant against a Pennsylvania man, Brandon Althof Long, stumbled across his Boring Company flamethrower propped against a wall. Long had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to riot and cause civil disorder, and conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony, during riots in Ohio protesting police brutality.</p>
<p>The agents seized the flamethrower out of concern for their safety, which a U.S. district judge later ruled lawful. &#8220;Other individuals could be located inside the house and the flamethrower could have been used to endanger officers as they retreated from Long&#8217;s home,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Novel items like flamethrowers are rarely specified in law, says <a href="https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/faculty/calo-ryan">Ryan Calo</a>, a law professor and co-founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. &#8220;Some items &#8211; like guns or spring knives &#8211; are weapons &#8216;per se,&#8217; meaning that they are always weapons. But most statutes have an &#8216;or other deadly weapon&#8217; clause as well, meaning that anything that is capable of causing serious bodily harm, even a rock, can be a weapon in the right circumstances,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The problem is, what circumstances? A flame-spouting weed-killer might not attract the interest of police, whereas a similar device styled like an assault rifle is more likely to be considered threatening. &#8220;And if you use the item during the commission of another crime, this can lead to a distinct offense of using a deadly weapon to commit a felony,&#8221; said Calo.</p>
<p>For all Musk&#8217;s portrayal of the Not a Flamethrower as just an entertaining toy, police forces &#8212; and criminals &#8212; in North America are increasingly treating them as dangerous weapons. In rural Wisconsin, a two-year narcotics investigation led police to arrest two men in July 2020 with a hoard of drugs, cash and weapons. Among the cocaine, pistols and assault rifles prominently displayed in the traditional seizure photo was a Boring Company flamethrower. Similar seizures were displayed by <a href="https://www.thewhig.com/news/local-news/police-seize-rifles-flamethrower-from-houses-in-deseronto-tyendinaga">police in Canada</a> in December and again <a href="https://www.guelphtoday.com/police/flamethrower-drugs-among-items-seized-as-guelph-police-raid-two-homes-3244115">this month</a>.</p>

<p>No company has complete control over what customers do with its products. However, this isn&#8217;t the first time a product connected to Musk has been misused.</p>
<p>Tesla, the electric automaker led by Musk, has been criticized for naming its advanced driver assistant system Autopilot and for calling the $10,000 add-on option Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though the driver must remain engaged at all times and is legally liable. A German court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/">banned the company</a> from using the terms &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; or &#8220;full potential for autonomous driving&#8221; on its website or in other marketing materials.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F8tz78dZ1D"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/">Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminology</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/embed/#?secret=F8tz78dZ1D" data-secret="F8tz78dZ1D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Safety advocates have argued that using terms like Autopilot and FSD misrepresents the capabilities of the system. The name, along with the lack of an in-cabin camera that monitors the driver, has led owners to push well beyond the bounds of the system.</p>
<p>Videos showing Tesla owners misusing Autopilot and FSD abound on YouTube. Some have had run-ins with law enforcement. One Canadian man was charged for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54197344">sleeping in his Tesla</a> as it drove down the highway.</p>
<h2>Eternal flame</h2>

<p>John Richardson eventually got his Not a Flamethrower back from the Metropolitan police. He now intends to keep it out of the public eye, at least until it&#8217;s worth selling. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to sit on it for however long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if there is a zombie apocalypse, at least I&#8217;ve got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, Craddock remains the only person that TechCrunch can identify as having been incarcerated solely for possessing a Not a Flamethrower. &#8220;It was a hair-raising experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the middle of nowhere in Sardinia, on 24-hour lockdown with an older guy giving off Mafia vibes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After nearly a week in prison, Craddock was abruptly handed his belongings (flamethrower aside) and set free. &#8220;My lawyer asked the judge, &#8216;Do you really want to be the guy on international news keeping an American in jail over this toy?&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that was the key to getting me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock took the first plane home. He says he now regrets taking the flamethrower abroad, and carrying it in public: &#8220;I would have preferred not to have spent that week in an Italian prison, but now I&#8217;ve got a hell of a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also has another flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I got back, I built myself a new one,&#8221; said Craddock. &#8220;You can follow YouTube videos with links to all the things you need. It&#8217;s pretty simple.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podchaser.com/">Podchaser</a>, a startup building what it calls &#8220;IMDB for podcasts,&#8221; recently announced that it has raised $4 million in a funding round led by Greycroft.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a site where — similar to <a href="https://www.imdb.com">the Amazon-owned Internet Movie Database</a> — users can look up who&#8217;s appeared in which podcasts, rate and review those podcasts and add them to lists. In fact, CEO Bradley Davis told me that the startup&#8217;s &#8220;vibrant, exciting community of podcast nerds&#8221; have already created 8.5 million podcast credits in the database.</p>
<p>Davis said this is something he simply wanted to exist and was, in fact, convinced that it had to exist already. When he realized that it didn&#8217;t, he posted on Reddit asking whether anyone was willing to build the company with him — which is how he connected with his eventual co-founder and CTO Ben Slinger in Australia. (Podchaser is a fully distributed company, with Davis currently based in Oklahoma City.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, Davis doesn&#8217;t think podcast nerds are the only ones taking advantage of the listings. Instead, he suggested that it&#8217;s useful for anyone looking to learn more about podcasts and discover new ones, with Podchaser&#8217;s monthly active users quintupling over the past year.</p>
<p>For example, he said that one of the most popular pages is politician <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/creators/pete-buttigieg-107ZztJDdR">Pete Buttigieg&#8217;s profile</a>, where visitors don&#8217;t just learn about Buttigieg&#8217;s own podcast but see others on which he&#8217;s appeared. (You can also use Podchaser to learn more about TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/equity-508514">Equity</a>, <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/techcrunch-mixtape-592290">Mixtape</a> and <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/original-content-547492">Original Content</a> podcasts, though those profiles could stand to be filled out a bit more.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/">Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/embed/#?secret=uhZrdLVRDq" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There has been endless discussion about how to fix podcast discovery, and while Davis isn&#8217;t claiming that Podchaser will solve it wholesale, he thinks it can be part of the solution — not just through its own database, but through the broader <a href="https://podcasttaxonomy.com">Podcast Taxonomy</a> project that it&#8217;s organizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we are successful at standardizing a lot of the terminology, and if we do an analysis of all podcasts, of how popular they are, that [will help many listeners] to cull and find the good stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Podchaser plans to add new features that will further encourage user contributions, like a gamification system and a discussion system.</p>
<p>While the consumer site is free, the startup recently launched a paid product called <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/pro">Podchaser Pro</a>, which provides reach and demographic data across 1.8 million podcasts. It also monetizes by providing podcast players with access to its credits through an API.</p>
<p>Davis said the startup was &#8220;lucky&#8221; that it decided to build a database that&#8217;s &#8220;agnostic&#8221; from any specific podcast player.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we had a lot of latitude to work with those platforms, we integrate with many of those platforms and you’re going to see a lot of our credits showing up [in podcast players],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Greycroft, Advancit Capital, LightShed Ventures, Powerhouse Capital, High Alpha, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Poplar Ventures also participated in the round, as did TrendKite founder A.J. Bruno, Ad Results Media CEO Marshall Williams and Shamrock Capital Partner Mike LaSalle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in the face of a pandemic, the podcast market continues to grow at a breakneck pace,&#8221; said Greycroft co-founder and chairman Alan Patricof in a statement. &#8220;The demand from consumers and brands is insatiable. Podchaser’s data and discovery tools are crucial to taking podcasting to new heights.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.adthena.com">Adthena</a> is expanding its partnership with market research company Kantar by acquiring Kantar&#8217;s paid search business.</p>
<p>The two companies <a href="https://www.research-live.com/article/news/kantar_and_adthena_launch_search_intelligence_partnership/id/5078462">announced an agreement earlier this month</a>, through which Adthena data will be integrated into Kantar&#8217;s ad intelligence product. Now, through this new acquisition, Adthena said Kantar search clients will get access to the Adthena product suite.</p>
<p>Kantar moved into the paid search business in 2012 by <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121221005332/en/Kantar-Media-Acquires-AdGooroo">acquiring AdGooroo</a> (not surprisingly, it eventually rebranded the offering).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As search continues to become the barometer by which all advertising efforts are measured, the importance of having access to the best intelligence possible cannot be understated,” said Adthena CEO Ian O’Rourke in a statement. “And this acquisition of Kantar’s paid search assets, in combination with our Kantar partnership, will enable us to break new ground for brands and agencies while also helping us to continue upon our growth trajectory.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/adthena-united-states/">O&#8217;Rourke previously told me</a> that Adthena stands out thanks to its &#8220;whole market view,&#8221; using artificial intelligence to create visualizations of all the keywords in paid and organic search used to find a business and their competitors.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Adthena confirmed that some Kantar team members will be joining the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based construction startup TraceAir today announced a $3.5 million Series A. Led by London-based XTX Ventures, this round brings the company’s total funding up to $7 million. The raise includes existing investor Metropolis VC, along with new additions Liquid 2 Ventures, GEM Capital, GPS Ventures and Andrew Filev.</p>
<p>We first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/our-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-17th-batch/slide/11/">noted the company back in 2016</a>, when it pitched a method for using drones to spot construction errors before they become too expense. It’s a pretty massive field that various technology companies are attempting to solve through a variety of different means, ranging from quadrupedal robots to site-scanning hard hats.</p>
<p>Last February, TraceAir announced a new drone management tool. “Haul Router provides the best mathematically objective hauls for each given drone scan,” the company noted at the time. “Any employee can use the tool to design a haul road and export the results to feed into grading equipment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic has thrown the construction industry for a loop (along with countless others). But unlike other sectors, demand still remains high in many places. TraceAir is hoping its solution will prove beneficial as many outfits seek a way to continue the process in spite of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“The Covid-19 pandemic created new challenges for the U.S. and worldwide construction industries, resulting in delayed projects and growing unemployment rates,” CEO Dmitry Korolev said in a release tied to the news. “Our platform allows industry leaders to manage projects more efficiently and collaborate with their teams remotely, minimizing the need for a physical presence on-site.”</p>
<p>TraceAir says the additional funding will go toward its sales and marketing, along with future product developments, including an unnamed product set for release this quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every picture posted to Facebook and Instagram gets a caption generated by an image analysis AI, and that AI just got a lot smarter. <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-people/">The improved system</a> should be a treat for visually impaired users, and may help you find your photos faster in the future.</p>
<p>Alt text is a field in an image&#8217;s metadata that describes its contents: &#8220;A person standing in a field with a horse,&#8221; or &#8220;a dog on a boat.&#8221; This lets the image be understood by people who can&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>These descriptions are often added manually by a photographer or publication, but people uploading photos to social media generally don&#8217;t bother, if they even have the option. So the relatively recent ability to automatically generate one — the technology has only just gotten good enough in the last couple years — has been extremely helpful in making social media more accessible in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9osJmffyHu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/ava-expands-its-ai-captioning-to-desktop-and-web-apps-and-raises-4-5m-to-scale/">Ava expands its AI captioning to desktop and web apps, and raises $4.5M to scale</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ava expands its AI captioning to desktop and web apps, and raises $4.5M to scale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/ava-expands-its-ai-captioning-to-desktop-and-web-apps-and-raises-4-5m-to-scale/embed/#?secret=9osJmffyHu" data-secret="9osJmffyHu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook created its Automatic Alt Text system in 2016, which is eons ago in the field of machine learning. The team has since cooked up many improvements to it, making it faster and more detailed, and the latest update adds an option to generate a more detailed description on demand.</p>
<p>The improved system recognizes 10 times more items and concepts than it did at the start, now around 1,200. And the descriptions include more detail. What was once &#8220;Two people by a building&#8221; may now be &#8220;A selfie of two people by the Eiffel Tower.&#8221; (The actual descriptions hedge with &#8220;may be&#8230;&#8221; and will avoid including wild guesses.)</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more detail than that, even if it&#8217;s not always relevant. For instance, in this image the AI notes the relative positions of the people and objects:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098299" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098299" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2098299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg" alt="The Facebook smartphone app showing detailed captions for an image." width="1024" height="688" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=1536,1032 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=2048,1375 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Obviously the people are above the drums, and the hats are above the people, none of which really needs to be said for someone to get the gist. But consider an image described as &#8220;A house and some trees and a mountain.&#8221; Is the house on the mountain or in front of it? Are the trees in front of or behind the house, or maybe on the mountain in the distance?</p>
<p>In order to adequately describe the image, these details should be filled in, even if the general idea can be gotten across with fewer words. If a sighted person wants more detail they can look closer or click the image for a bigger version — someone who can&#8217;t do that now has a similar option with this &#8220;generate detailed image description&#8221; command. (Activate it with a long press in the Android app or a custom action in iOS.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the new description would be something like &#8220;A house and some trees in front of a mountain with snow on it.&#8221; That paints a better picture, right? (To be clear, these examples are made up, but it&#8217;s the sort of improvement that&#8217;s expected.)</p>
<p>The new detailed description feature will come to Facebook first for testing, though the improved vocabulary will appear on Instagram soon. The descriptions are also kept simple so they can be easily translated to other languages already supported by the apps, though the feature may not roll out in other countries simultaneously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is always in search of a better way to instantly connect users to something to watch, instead of having them waste time unsuccessfully scrolling through all the available programming options. Now, the company says a recent test focused on solving this problem, Shuffle Play, has proven popular enough to roll out to all users worldwide.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">the streamer&#8217;s Q4 2020 earnings</a>, announced today, Netflix noted the product development only briefly. It referred broadly to a test of a new feature that &#8220;gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse.&#8221; It also noted the feature would reach all users worldwide sometime in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch the test in question is Shuffle Play, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">which we first covered back in August 2020</a>. However, the company tells us the actual name of the feature is something that&#8217;s still being tested.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shuffle Play puts a big button right on the Netflix home screen, beneath your profile icon. When clicked, Netflix randomly plays content its personalization algorithms think you&#8217;ll like. This could include a movie you&#8217;re currently watching, something you&#8217;ve saved to your watch list or a title that&#8217;s similar to something you&#8217;ve already watched, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sRUh1EToYV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">Netflix shares soar as it passes 200M paying subscribers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix shares soar as it passes 200M paying subscribers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/embed/#?secret=sRUh1EToYV" data-secret="sRUh1EToYV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A variation has also been spotted in the TV app&#8217;s sidebar navigation. More recently, we&#8217;ve found this sidebar option relabeled as &#8220;Shuffle Play,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Play Something&#8221; as before.</p>
<p>In addition, as you start scrolling down through the Netflix home screen on the TV, you&#8217;ll eventually come across a screen that explains what the option is for and points to the new button with a red arrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sure what to watch?&#8221; this page asks, before explaining how Shuffle Play works.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098323" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098323" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png 3712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=1536,935 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=2048,1246 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098323" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The button has already appeared on some users&#8217; Netflix app for TV devices, due to the ongoing tests.</p>
<p>In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said the user response to Shuffle Play has been positive &#8212; which is funny because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">the original responses to the feature on social media</a> were decidedly mixed. However, the company doesn&#8217;t make its decisions based on what a <a href="https://twitter.com/SiphokaziKayana/status/1293980088892100612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293980088892100612%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">handful</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/kgdobs/status/1293069402338820096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293069402338820096%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stylesperiodt/status/1295667352676126720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295667352676126720%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">once</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerLevison/status/1295543859141844992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295543859141844992%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">said</a>, but rather in how Netflix members actually used the product, of course.</p>
<p>Netflix also tells us the feature is still being tested only on TV devices, not other platforms like web or mobile. It declined to say how many users or what percentage had been opted into the test to date.</p>
<p>Shuffle Play is the latest in a long series of tests where Netflix has tried to make it easier to find something to watch right away.</p>
<p>In 2019, for example, Netflix tried out a shuffle mode that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/netflix-says-its-testing-a-shuffle-feature-for-when-you-dont-know-what-to-watch/">let you click on a popular show to start playing a random episode</a>. This may have worked well when users wanted to play a random episode of <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-mov-netflix-the-office-0705-20190703-fjlo4pkt5jb7llpo2aixl7o2pe-story.html">their default pick</a>, like the “The Office” or “Friends,” but Netflix has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/nbc-pulling-office-netflix-2021-n1021791">lost</a> <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1107124/how-to-survive-friends-leaving-netflix-they-re-still-there-for-you">both.</a></p>
<p>It has also promoted its shows on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/netflix-experiments-with-promoting-its-shows-on-the-login-screen/">the login screen</a> and as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/netflix-adds-a-screensaver-to-its-tv-apps-to-promote-its-original-content/">screensavers</a>, and notoriously autoplayed previews until last year, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/">finally caved in to user demand</a> for a way to turn this off.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yH1YH28Go0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/">Netflix’s horrible autoplay previews can be turned off</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix’s horrible autoplay previews can be turned off&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/embed/#?secret=yH1YH28Go0" data-secret="yH1YH28Go0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Overall, the goal is to make the Netflix experience closer to that of traditional TV, where you could switch the set on and content just started playing.</p>
<p>Netflix says Shuffle Play will roll out globally in the first half of 2021, but didn&#8217;t share more specifics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Qualtrics debut is going to be huge, and that matters. Can the bankers get its IPO price closer to what retail investors are willing to pay?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, Qualtrics dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828021000498/qualtricss-1a2.htm">new S-1 filing</a>, this time detailing its proposed IPO pricing. That means we can now get a good look at how much the company may be worth when it goes public later this month.</p>
<p>The debut has been one TechCrunch has been looking forward to since the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">announced</a> that it would be spun out from its erstwhile corporate parent, SAP. In 2019, the Germany-based enterprise giant SAP snatched up Qualtrics for $8 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">just before it was to go public</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Qualtrics is either worth less than we would have guessed, or its first IPO range feels light.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That figure provides a good marker for how well SAP has done with the deal and how much value Qualtrics has generated in the intervening years. Keep in mind, however, that the value of software companies has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">risen greatly</a> in the last few years, so the numbers we&#8217;ll see below benefit from a market-wide repricing of recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Qualtrics estimates that it may be worth $22 to $26 per share when it goes public. Is that a lot? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Qualtrics&#8217; first IPO range</h2>
<p>First, scale. Qualtrics is selling just under 50 million shares in its public offering. As you can math out, at more than $20 per share, the company is looking to raise north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>After going public, Qualtrics anticipates having 510,170,610 shares outstanding, inclusive of its 7.4 million underwriter option. Using that simple share count, Qualtrics would be worth $11.2 billion to $13.3 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix capped off a year of impressive streaming growth by adding 8.5 million net new paying subscribers during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>That means the streaming giant now has a total of 204 million paying subscribers worldwide — net growth of 37 million new subscribers for the full year, up from 28 million net additions in 2019.</p>
<p>The company also <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">reported</a> that it brought in $6.64 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $1.19 during Q4, compared to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX"> analyst predictions</a> of $6.63 billon in revenue and EPS of $1.39.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In response to the earnings report, Netflix shares were up 12.4% in after-hours trading (as of 4:43 p.m. Eastern).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Netflix projected that it will add 6.0 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2021 — the same as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">old forecast for Q4</a>, and less than half the 15.8 million subscribers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/neflix-q1-earnings/">Netflix added in Q1 2020</a> (right as lockdowns were beginning in the United States).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h3aGby0m9w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">Netflix user growth slows as production ramps up again</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The company&#8217;s investor letter also highlights a number of hit titles from the quarter, projecting that 72 million households will &#8220;choose to watch&#8221; (watch at least two minutes of) &#8220;The Midnight Sky&#8221; in its first 28 days of release, while 68 million households chose to watch &#8220;Holidate.&#8221; It also said the most recent season of &#8220;The Crown&#8221; was its most popular yet, with more than 100 million households choosing to watch the show &#8220;since its initial launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural zeitgeist,&#8221; Netflix said. &#8220;In 2020 alone, we had ​&#8217;Tiger King,​&#8217; &#8216;​Bridgerton​&#8217; and ​&#8217;The Queen’s Gambit​.&#8217; &#8230; In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company acknowledged growing competition from new(-ish) streaming services like Disney+, Peacock and HBO Max, but its user numbers still put it far ahead of any streaming competition — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney+, for example, had 86.8 million subscribers</a> as of early December (Disney&#8217;s service launched a little over a year ago and is still rolling out globally).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment,&#8221; Netflix said. &#8220;This past year is a testament to this approach. Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history.&#8221;</p>
<p>EMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom made a similar point in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netflix ended 2020 on a high note, adding over 36 million subscribers and passing 200 million subscribers. Despite increasing competition from Disney and others, Netflix had its strongest year yet and will look to grow further in 2021, with a strong content release slate already planned. So far, Netflix has been a clear winner of the streaming wars.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[When should deep-tech companies hire marketers, and do these hires need industry experience?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deep tech startups develop cutting-edge innovations with the power to truly revolutionize society. The founding team members at these companies often come from deeply technical backgrounds, which powers rapid product progress but can create bottlenecks on the go-to-market side.</p>
<p>In this post, I outline the answers to four key questions around marketing at early-stage deep tech companies that are post-revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing teams at deep tech companies do.</li>
<li>When to hire the marketing team.</li>
<li>Whether the marketing team needs industry experience.</li>
<li>How to source and evaluate talent for the marketing team.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this post, deep tech startups can formulate their marketing hiring strategy and attract and cultivate top talent to drive their go-to-market plan. Without business execution, even the most groundbreaking innovations do not achieve their intended impact.</p>
<h2><strong>What do marketing teams at deep tech companies do? </strong></h2>
<p>To set the context, I share below the typical projects of deep tech marketing teams, which look different from marketing in other industries given the greater product focus and complexity, regulatory oversight and longer time to market.</p>
<h3><strong>Go-to-market</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers leverage the strength of the IP to establish collaborations with large companies, such as pharma companies and institutions, such as the government, universities or hospitals. To this end, marketers develop creative ways to gather lists of, and information on, key contacts at these potential partners. They also build sales collateral, such as demo videos, pitch decks and one-pagers, to more effectively reach and build long-term relationships with these prospects.</p>
<p>More broadly, marketers also develop the go-to-market strategy beyond partnerships. To this end, marketers conduct in-depth market research on business models, monetization strategies and reimbursement channels.</p>
<h3><strong>Communications</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers create original content to establish the company as a thought leader, build the company’s brand credibility through social media and apply for awards and honors to validate the potential of the company’s solution.</p>
<h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers work with finance and product teams to formulate projections as the company moves into the clinical phase.</p>
<h2><strong>When should deep tech companies hire marketers?</strong></h2>
<p>The CEO and other members of the founding team take on marketing work in the formation stage to better understand and empathize with the needs, capabilities and opportunities in the department before bringing someone on full time.</p>
<p>Once the product shows signs of repeatable revenue, a marketing lead is needed. Specifically, this is ahead of a large Series A round, after a small Series A round or when a commercial partner has expressed interest in larger, long-term contracts. Instead of the typical chief marketing officer or chief revenue officer title, deep tech startups call this person a chief commercial officer or chief partnerships officer.</p>
<p>For additional support in the formation stage, companies bring on MBA interns and work with their investors. Prior to the Series A, platform teams at deep tech venture-capital funds are hands-on in helping with marketing through actually doing marketing projects for their portfolio companies, ideating on long-term marketing strategy with the founders through regular feedback sessions and connecting founders with vetted marketing contractors or agencies.</p>
<p>For companies that require FDA approval, commercial advisors, consultants and board members fully take on the partnership strategy work (which represents the bulk of the marketing needs) prior to the Series A round. Similarly, external consultants, such as marketing agencies, can take over major projects like launch strategy. External consultants can then join the team should their performance be strong.</p>
<p>For drug-development companies, the marketing leader is most crucial when the company enters the clinical phase and prepares for trials, regardless of funding stage.</p>
<h2><strong>Do marketing hires need industry experience? </strong></h2>
<p>Of course, it is ideal to hire someone with experience selling into the space and someone who is comfortable with the complex supply chains and long sales cycles. However, if the choice is between someone with functional expertise but no industry expertise and someone with industry experience but limited or no functional expertise, it is better to hire the former candidate and leverage the rest of the team for domain expertise. Deep tech is a niche area, so the other team members can support the marketer in developing industry expertise.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.micromobility.com/">Bolt Mobility</a>, the Miami-based micromobility startup co-founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt, is expanding to 48 new markets after acquiring the assets of Last Mile Holdings.</p>
<p>Bolt Mobility&#8217;s rise and Last Mile&#8217;s demise captures the uncertainty that plagued micromobility companies in the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic upended business models that were, in some cases, already on shaky ground.</p>
<p>Bolt Mobility and Last Mile were both negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bolt Mobility, for instance, had to shut down in several markets in early 2020 due to the pandemic. The company rebounded after it tweaked its business model and began to partner with local operators, added GM&#8217;s former VP global design Ed Welburn as an adviser and came out with a new scooter equipped with dual brakes, 10-inch wheels, LED lights, swappable batteries with 25 miles of range and NanoSeptic surfaces on its handlebars and brake levers designed to rid these common contact points of germs and bacteria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last Mile Holdings didn&#8217;t fare as well.</p>
<p>If Last Mile Holdings doesn&#8217;t sound familiar, the brands it once owned might. Last Mile was a holding company that owned the OjO Electric scooters and Gotcha Mobility, which had a portfolio of electric trikes, scooters and bikes. The company acquired Gotcha in a $12 million cash and stock deal that closed in March 2020.</p>
<p>As Bolt Mobility grew, with its customer base hitting 300,000 users in 2020, Last Mile hit headwinds. Last Mile Holdings, which traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under MILE, ended up selling its U.S. assets in an auction. Bolt Mobility acquired substantially all of the assets of the company for a credit bid of $3 million, according to a filing at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Those assets include 8,500 new devices, including e-scooters, e-bikes, pedal bikes and sit-down cruisers and licenses to operate in 48 new markets, the majority of which (more than 30) are exclusive contracts, according to Bolt CEO Ignacio Tzoumas. The 48 new markets include 18 university campuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition represents a significant expansion for Bolt on all fronts,&#8221; Tzoumas said, adding that the company brought on former Gotcha Chief Operating Officer Matt Tolan, who will now serve as Bolt&#8217;s chief commercial officer, as well as about 20 team members who were formerly a part of Gotcha&#8217;s tech and operations teams.</p>
<p>Riders in Bolt&#8217;s new markets will continue to be able to access and use the e-scooters, e-bikes and pedal bikes through the Gotcha Mobility and Ojo Electric iOS and Android mobile apps. Bolt is working with cities and universities to transition these markets to Bolt&#8217;s platform. The acquisition adds e-bikes to the Bolt platform for the first time. Although, the company was already developing its own line of e-bikes that it plans to launch later this year.</p>

<p>Bolt credits its new business model for helping it survive and even thrive in 2020. Instead of continuing to handle the complex and expensive task of fleet management and operations, Bolt decided to partner with local companies. These partners operate <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bolt’s fleets on the ground in each individual market. This customizable approach allowed for a business partnership model in select markets where Bolt leased scooters to delivery workers, restaurants and other small businesses, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">By July, Bolt and its partners were operating in five new or re-launched markets. Bolt also has a backlog of agreements with partners for an additional 20 markets that the acquisition is primed to fulfill, according to the company. </span></p>
<p>Tzoumas said Bolt was able to execute the deal without taking on any additional debt, and &#8220;under terms that will allow us to continue devoting our resources to expanding and improving our services in all of the markets where we operate.&#8221; The acquisition was funded in part by Fuel Venture Capital, an existing Bolt investor.  Bolt is also backed by Sofreh Capital and The Yucaipa Companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded Bolt because we believe in micromobility as a movement that can transform the way people live and move within their communities,&#8221; Usain Bolt said in a statement. &#8220;This expansion proves that anything is possible for micromobility when you support it with talented people, innovative technology, and the incredible work ethic of the Bolt team.&#8221;</p>
