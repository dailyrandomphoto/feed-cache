										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically speaking, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to offer a real review of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the long-awaited follow-up to <em>The Witcher 3</em> from developer CD Projekt Red. In the first place, it&#8217;s so big that the few days I&#8217;ve had with it aren&#8217;t enough to realistically evaluate the game; second, it&#8217;s so buggy and janky now that it feels wrong to review it before it becomes the game I know it will be; and finally, everyone&#8217;s going to buy it anyway.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 is among the most universally lauded games of the last decade, up there with <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and <em>Dark Souls</em>. Though it had its flaws — lackluster combat, a limited scope — it did the open world thing better than anyone before or since, largely through improved writing, interesting characters, and consequences to player choices.</p>
<p>It was during what you might call that game&#8217;s honeymoon period that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was announced, and in the years since then the game has approached untenable levels of hype: It could never live up to what people expected, but it could very feasibly be a good game in its own right.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent controversies, however, have cast a pall over the launch: A seemingly hypocritical condemnation of pre-release crunch from the developer, some indefensible choices regarding diversity in the game (racialized gangs and a questionable approach to gender and trans representation), and delays suggested this may not be the magnum opus people hoped for.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>In the first place I can confirm that the game probably should have been given a few more months of polish, at least on PC, the platform I played it on. From the very start I encountered obvious bugs like characters failing to animate, objects floating in mid-air, and the admittedly expected physics silliness one finds in every open-world game with simulated objects interacting. A day-one patch may fix some of them, but it&#8217;s clear that a game this big is nearly impossible to smooth out entirely. (I should say that I&#8217;m only partway through the 40-odd-hour campaign, though like its predecessor that will be padded out considerably with side quests.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a shame, because the world CD Projekt Red has created — or rather adapted from the tabletop RPG on which it is based — is undeniably rich and lovingly fashioned. The easiest way to describe it is simply to say that it&#8217;s exactly what you imagine when you think of &#8220;cyberpunk,&#8221; no more but surely no less.</p>
<p>The look of overcrowded streets filled with weirdo future people, shuffling between food carts offering vat-grown meat, beneath floating neon advertisements for cybernetic limbs and hacking tools, all watched over by enormous corporations of dubious intention&#8230; it&#8217;s right out of Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic, Strange Days, Ghost in the Shell, Neuromancer, and dozens of other genre pieces that informed both the original RPG and the general ideas that constitute &#8220;cyberpunk&#8221; in the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familiar world you&#8217;ll be entering in some ways, with few real surprises if you&#8217;re at all conversant in the genre. That is a good thing in many ways, as it feels like a lived-in place: a crystallization and expansion of ideas that, while you have seen them elsewhere, have never been at your fingertips so readily, save perhaps in the original Deus Ex, which had its own limitations.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Yet at the same time there is very much the feel of a lack of imagination and willingness to update those ideas in ways that seem obvious. The gangs based on racial identities seem like such a poor fit for both this era and for a future in which such distinctions have no doubt declined in relevance, especially in a vast melting pot like Night City. The stereotypical &#8220;Mexican tough guy&#8221; dialogue of your otherwise likeable companion Jackie grates, for instance, as do for example the stilted, supposedly Japanese mannerisms of staff at an Arasaka corporate hotel.</p>
<p>Gender is also a mixed bag. Reviews by queer-identifying reviewers at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22158019/cyberpunk-2077-review-cd-projekt-red-pc-ps4-xbox-one-stadia">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/30-hours-with-cyberpunk-2077-brings-mixed-feelings-1845824151">Kotaku</a> have much more relevance here than anything I can say, but I can only concur that the freedom the player has in selecting their presentation is an important step towards better representation of queerness in games — but also has a &#8220;do as I say, not as I do&#8221; feeling. Elsewhere in the game sex and gender are handled regressively or inconsistently with the clear implication that, with body modification something anyone one can do on a street corner for a few eurobucks, race and gender are fluid and unimportant in this world.</p>
<p>This future feels like it was extrapolated exclusively from the forward thinking but still limited minds of a bunch of smart white guys from the &#8217;90s. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I feel so comfortable in it. But as Ready Player One demonstrated, there&#8217;s a limit to how much can be accomplished by those methods.</p>
<p>At the same time I want to call out the care that was obviously taken in some ways to have a future filled with people of different shapes, sizes, colors, inclinations, and everything else — it&#8217;s clear there is genuine good intention here, even if it stumbles with unfortunate regularity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>&#8220;What about the game itself, you babbler,&#8221; you ask, after 800 words, &#8220;is it any good?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s good, but difficult to categorize. On one hand, you have a paralysis-inducing freedom in shaping the capabilities with which your character approaches the various situations he or she will encounter. Brute force, stealth, hacking, gunplay — all are quite viable, but don&#8217;t expect to get far relying on only one. A &#8220;pure hacking&#8221; approach, for instance, will be far more tedious than it&#8217;s worth, while a &#8220;pure gunplay&#8221; one will likewise miss the point.</p>
<p>In navigating an enemy base, taking down some rando street gang, or getting through one of the game&#8217;s highly involved criminal operations, there are many options for any given situation, but none is reliable enough (certainly not early on, anyway) to get you through without resorting to the others.</p>
<p>One inconveniently placed guard may be susceptible to having his eyes hacked, while another may be easily distracted by one of the numerous items you can make fizzle out and attract their attention. But when you eventually slip up and the bullets start to fly, you&#8217;re not going to hack your way out of it. That&#8217;s okay, though: You&#8217;re not a scalpel, you&#8217;re a Swiss Army knife. Act like it!</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The open world in which you&#8217;ll be undertaking all these missions is a rich one&#8230; perhaps too rich. Open the map and you&#8217;re presented with a sea of icons, though they&#8217;re not quite the Ubisoft-style to-do list so much as letting you know that this is a big, dense city where you&#8217;ll never lack for gun shops, criminal activities to engage in or disrupt, and interesting locations to explore. If you think of the map as more &#8220;where&#8217;s a ripper around here? Let me check my phone&#8221; than generic &#8220;video game map&#8221; it makes more sense, though it&#8217;s obviously the latter as well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be driving around a lot as well, a process that is about as smooth as it was in <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>. Using the totally inadequate keyboard controls for my car, I&#8217;ve caused panics and accidents, mowed people down, and obstructed traffic constantly, while attempting to follow every law and attract as little attention as possible. This part of the game feels hilariously last generation, like how in <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Odyssey</em>, your all-terrain horse vehicle was an object of terror and lethality to any peasant stupid enough to walk on one of that game&#8217;s many mountain trails.</p>
<p>The helpful GPS directions once took me through a pedestrian occupied area with a gate that was just narrow enough to completely trap the car, though it extricated itself offscreen when I called it. Another time I summoned the car to my location and instantly heard a distant explosion and screams. The car arrived 30 seconds later completely trashed, missing the doors on one side. Fortunately it seems to repair itself by mysterious means when you&#8217;re not looking.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>But when you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing — you know, cyberpunk stuff — things are smoother, if not what I&#8217;d call completely modern. I had this feeling the whole time like I was playing a game whose bones were built 8 years ago and then wrapped in layer after layer of stuff, creating systems and environments that feel incredibly cool in some ways and, like the car, huge throwbacks in others. The gunplay isn&#8217;t as good as any shooter today, the melee is about at <em>Skyrim</em> quality, the hacking is perhaps <em>Deus Ex</em> levels, and stealth is nowhere near <em>Metal Gear</em> — but none of those games actually offered the breadth or richness of systems and environments as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>In the final — for the purpose of this article, which is to say incredibly limited and initial — analysis, it&#8217;s both accurate to say that this game is <em>GTA: Night City 2077</em> and totally inadequate. It&#8217;s both unique and totally derivative, futuristic and regressive, wide-open and painfully restrictive. Like many AAA games these days, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> contains multitudes, and short of being a total faceplant, which it undeniably isn&#8217;t, it has a huge draw and value for the millions of players who want to hoon around a cyberpunk dystopia, hacking and shooting and scheming and getting better armblades, eyeball replacements, and future-guns.</p>
<p>I suppose the simplest summary of my review would be that I look forward to playing <em>Cyberpunk</em> when it&#8217;s finished. <em>The Witcher 3</em> came out to acclaim but also criticism of many of its systems, and over time it has evolved into the genre-leading game it is. <em>Cyberpunk</em> has that potential, but it undeniably also has real issues that I would like to let them address before I play it. If you have any patience, I&#8217;d give it a few months at least so you don&#8217;t have the best of the game spoiled by the worst. At some point in the future I think <em>Cyberpunk</em> will be a pivotal title in gaming, but not yet — let&#8217;s just hope it gets there before 2077.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation, </a>the autonomous vehicle startup backed by Sequoia Capital and Amazon, has reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that will value the combined company at $10 billion.</p>
<p>Aurora is not paying cash for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ATG, a company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/uber-atg-1-billion-toyota-denso-vision-fund-spin-out/">valued at $7.25 billion</a> following a $1 billion investment last year from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (As a refresher, Uber held an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519188316/d767435d8k.htm">SEC</a>. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8% in the company.) Shareholders in Uber ATG will now become minority shareholders of Aurora.</p>
<p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will take a board seat in the newly expanded Aurora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017, is focused on building the full self-driving stack, the underlying technology that will allow vehicles to navigate highways and city streets without a human driver behind the wheel. Aurora has attracted attention and investment from high-profile venture firms, management firms and corporations such as Greylock Partners, Sequoia Capital,  Amazon and T. Rowe Price, in part because of its founders Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, all of whom are veterans of the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Urmson led the former Google self-driving project before it spun out to become the Alphabet business Waymo. Anderson is best known for leading the development and launch of the Tesla Model X and the automaker’s Autopilot program. Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, helped launch Uber’s efforts in autonomy, ultimately heading the autonomy and perception team at the Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Aurora plans to bring autonomous trucks to market first. However, Urmson has maintained that the company is still pursuing other applications of its self-driving stack such as robotaxis. The deal with Uber ATG provides Aurora with talent and operational facilities. But it delivers on two other important areas: relationships with Uber ATG investors, specifically Toyota, as well as a partnership with Uber that will give it access to its vast ride-hailing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we want to build this company has been with this mindset of let&#8217;s build it to scale — let&#8217;s create an environment where people can do their best work,&#8221; Urmson said in an interview Monday. &#8220;And then let&#8217;s go look for great teams and bring them in. It&#8217;s one way to get a combination of talent and technology, and in this case, also relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement, which confirms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/uber-in-talks-to-sell-atg-self-driving-unit-to-aurora/">TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting in November</a>, marks the beginning of what promises to be a huge undertaking to merge Uber ATG, a 1,200-person business unit with operations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto with its smaller competitor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if all Uber ATG employees will be folded into Aurora, which has 600-person workforce and operations in San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Texas and Bozeman, Montana. At least one executive — Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer — will not be joining the company.</p>
<p>Urmson emphasized that work to integrate the companies and their technology will begin without haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most fun things we&#8217;ll be doing over the next 60 days is bringing the two teams together,&#8221; Urmson said. &#8220;And then kind of dispassionately looking at what is the technology that accelerates our first product to market and then amplifying that — whether it&#8217;s from the existing Aurora team or to the new Aurora team — and pushing that forward, whether it&#8217;s ideas or code or bits of hardware together to accelerate our time to market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to assess the workforce and technology as quickly as possible, Urmson said.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s AV history</h2>
<p>For Uber, the deal marks one of the last expensive pursuits that it had yet to either spin or sell off as the company narrowed in on its core businesses of ride-hailing and delivery. In the past year, Uber has dumped shared micromobility unit Jump, sold a stake in its growing but still unprofitable logistics arm, Uber Freight and acquired Postmates. Uber is also reportedly in talks to sell off its autonomous air taxi business Uber Elevate.</p>
<p>Uber ATG was one of those businesses that promised financial benefits in the long term, but delivered lots of pain, controversy and upfront costs since almost the moment it was created.</p>
<p>In early 2015, Uber kicked off its pursuit of autonomous vehicles when it announced a strategic partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Center. The agreement to work on developing driverless car technology resulted in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-uber-a-friend-or-foe-of-carnegie-mellon-in-robotics-1433084582">Uber poaching dozens of NREC researchers</a> and scientists. A year later, Uber acquired a self-driving truck startup called Otto, a startup founded by one of Google’s star engineers, Anthony Levandowski, along with three other Google veterans: Lior Ron, Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette.</p>
<p>Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn’t a party to either arbitration. While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>
<p>With the trial over, Uber pressed on, but almost immediately was involved in another deadlier controversy when one of its autonomous test vehicles — which had a human safety driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a pedestrian in March 2018. The entire industry took pause and Uber halted all testing.</p>
<p>Uber spun out Uber ATG in spring 2019 after closing $1 billion in funding from Toyota, auto parts maker Denso and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Even with the spin off, Uber still faced a costly enterprise. Uber reported in November that ATG and “other technologies” (which includes Uber Elevate) had a net loss of $303 million in the nine months that ended September 30, 2020. In its S-1 document, Uber said it incurred $457 million of research and development expenses for its ATG and “other Technology Programs” initiatives.</p>
<h2>What Aurora values</h2>
<p>Despite the trail of problems that have plagued Uber ATG, Urmson insists that the company has the talent and some interesting technology that makes it a worthy asset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the work they&#8217;ve been doing in designing their next-generation hardware for the vehicles is exciting and interesting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the software side, they have really cool stuff in prediction, and how they&#8217;ve combined prediction and the perception system together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others close to the deal said Uber ATG has valuable and talented mid-level and low-level engineers, making the acquisition particularly appealing to Aurora.</p>
<p>This is not Aurora&#8217;s first acquisition, although it is certainly its largest and most complex. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">Aurora acquired Blackmore</a>, a Bozeman, Montana-based lidar company, and simulation startup 7D Labs. Aurora has touted its  &#8220;no jerks&#8221; policy and its company culture, which is now about to absorb hundreds of new people.</p>
<p>Post-merger integrations can take months, even years, which can in turn slow down technological or operational progress. Urmson thinks differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything, this accelerates our objectives,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.odysee.com">Odysee</a> is a new video site that CEO Jeremy Kauffman said was created to recapture some of the freedom and independence of the internet he grew up with — an internet where &#8220;anyone could speak and anyone could have a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kauffman argued that since then, the internet has become &#8220;very corporate,&#8221; with a small number of companies controlling the flow of information. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nimbuz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nimbuz">Odysee <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was created to provide an alternative — and eventually, more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some would call it an alternative to YouTube,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We like to think it’s the successor.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The site was created by the team behind the <a href="https://lbry.com/">Lbry</a> (pronounced &#8220;library&#8221;) blockchain protocol. Kauffman emphasized that neither Odysee creators nor their viewers need to know anything about the technology (&#8220;blockchain is a how, it&#8217;s not a why&#8221;), but he said this approach gives those creators more direct control of their content and their audience. As Kauffman put it, &#8220;Your channel exists, effectively, in a cryptocurrency wallet that you can download.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lbry website <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/what-is-lbry">offers a few more details</a>: &#8220;For the same reasons that nobody can prevent a Bitcoin transaction from taking place, nobody can prevent a transaction (like a publication or a tip) from appearing on the LBRY blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Odysee website sits on top of this protocol. While anyone could, in theory, publish anything to the Lbry blockchain, Odysee restricts content based on <a href="https://odysee.com/@OdyseeHelp:b/Community-Guidelines:c">a handful of community guidelines</a> that prohibit things like pornography and content that promotes violence or terrorism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jqSSj5Dzg1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/youtube-suspends-and-demonetizes-one-america-news-network-over-covid-19-video/">YouTube suspends and demonetizes One America News Network over COVID-19 video</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube suspends and demonetizes One America News Network over COVID-19 video&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/youtube-suspends-and-demonetizes-one-america-news-network-over-covid-19-video/embed/#?secret=jqSSj5Dzg1" data-secret="jqSSj5Dzg1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, Kauffman said, &#8220;We do think that YouTube is far too strict.&#8221; As an example, he pointed to the Google-owned platform&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/17/scott-atlas-youtube/">remove an interview with the Trump administration&#8217;s pandemic advisor Scott Atlas</a> in which he questioned social distancing and stay-at-home orders. (Dr. Atlas <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/30/politics/scott-atlas-resigns-trump-administration-coronavirus-task-force/index.html">resigned from his position</a> in the administration last week.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Strict&#8221; is not exactly the word I&#8217;d use to describe YouTube&#8217;s moderation policies, and I&#8217;d also argue that it&#8217;s a good thing that the big digital platforms are being (somewhat) more proactive in blocking or at least labeling misinformation around high-stakes topics like the COVID-19 pandemic, or President Trump&#8217;s efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/youtube-demonetizes-but-wont-pull-trump-won-video-following-backlash/">de-legitimize his defeat in the November election</a>.</p>
<p>Kauffman countered that in the Atlas example, &#8220;You don&#8217;t delete the video. That&#8217;s not how science progresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while loudly declaring your dedication to &#8220;free speech&#8221; has increasingly served as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">a euphemism for attracting right-wing content and users</a>, Kauffman said that&#8217;s not his aim.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mX1iuhVLMB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/embed/#?secret=mX1iuhVLMB" data-secret="mX1iuhVLMB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to be a space where all voices can be heard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a compelling argument that the big platforms <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-all-the-tech-hearings?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDg1NTUsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE1MzU3OTA5LCJfIjoiN0ZkYjIiLCJpYXQiOjE2MDczNzE4MTYsImV4cCI6MTYwNzM3NTQxNiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTExODQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.ft9XIJA4r3c8qdoVmKg2_SMRZyHyaWAW7wvMFckelho">simply have too much power</a>, so regardless of your opinion on any particular platform or decision, you could see Odysee as an attempt to return that power to individual creators.</p>
<p>Plus, politics only represents one slice of what&#8217;s being published on the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to go watch &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; or Gordon Ramsay clips, go to YouTube,&#8221; Kauffman said. &#8220;If you want to watch this crazy, trippy video that a 19-year-old made in their house but it’s super interesting, that’s the kind of stuff that you can find on Odysee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Odysee necessarily expects creators to post exclusively to the site, as <a href="https://odysee.com/@UpperEchelonGamers:3">Upper Echelon Gamers</a> acknowledged in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest draw for me to Odysee was an automated second library of content that can build on its own without increasing my workload. Combine that with a much clearer monetization formula, and far more responsive communication with the administration and you have a platform that is very exciting to work with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odysee officially launched this month, but it says that since the beta version went live in September, more than 400,000 people have posted a total of 5 million videos to the site, which is already attracting 8.7 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>The plan is to eventually make money from advertising, with creators given full control over how they monetize. Individual viewers, meanwhile, will also be able to pay to skip ads, even if it&#8217;s just for one video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Do people want their at-home fitness to come in video-game form? The incredible <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/ring-fit-adventure-has-sold-over-4-million-units-worldwide/">popularity of games like Ring Fit Adventure</a> suggests yes.</p>
<p>London-based startup <a href="https://quell.tech">Quell</a> thinks it&#8217;s just the beginning for this genre, and they&#8217;ve raised a $3 million seed round to help prove it.</p>
<p>At the core of Quell&#8217;s gameplay is the &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; — a harness, of sorts, that the player slips on to control Quell&#8217;s games. As players punch and dodge their way through the world, Gauntlet&#8217;s built-in sensors measure things like punch speed and accuracy, while customizable resistance bands keep things challenging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We initially wrote about Quell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/quells-resistance-based-workout-can-get-you-in-shape-by-boxing-virtual-enemies/">back in August</a>, and named it as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/our-12-favorite-startups-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-2/">one of our top startups</a> from the Y Combinator S20 Demo Day.</p>
<p>Investors in this round include Twitch co-founders Kevin Lin and Emmett Shear, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, WikiHow founder Josh Hannah, TenCent, Khosla Ventures, Heartcore, Social Impact Capital and JamJar Investments. Quell co-founder Doug Stidolph tells me they were initially raising at a valuation of $10 million; by the time they&#8217;d closed the final investors in this round, the valuation had increased to $15 million. The company also recently closed a Kickstarter campaign, where it raised £501,341 (around $670,000 USD) from nearly 3,000 backers. With the ongoing pandemic making it scarier and riskier to hit the gym (if your state/county even allows it), interest and demand for home fitness options will just keep going up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2032690" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2032690" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2032690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Quell_Promo.2020-08-17-17_29_01.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2032690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Quell</p></div></p>
<p>Quell&#8217;s hardware and games are initially being built to work with PC, Mac and mobile devices. That means no console support at first — a bummer, as a big ol&#8217; TV seems like the ideal display for games like this, and consoles are probably the most user-friendly way of getting it there. It&#8217;s something the company says it has on its roadmap to hopefully tackle in the future, but the added cost/complexity of the console hardware approval process was a bit too much to take on at launch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Quell’s resistance-based workout can get you in shape by boxing virtual enemies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/quells-resistance-based-workout-can-get-you-in-shape-by-boxing-virtual-enemies/embed/#?secret=jTG7NTglOv" data-secret="jTG7NTglOv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Quell is building out its own in-house game studio, hiring folks like Peter Cornelius (formerly lead producer at the developer-centric gaming tech company Improbable) as Game Production director. One of the main goals, Quell co-founder Cameron Brookhouse tells me, is to build games that get the player exercising while still being deeply immersive; they want the gameplay to encourage movement intuitively, rather than tossing up prompts that say something like, &#8220;OK! Time for jumping jacks!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Quell team tells me they expect their first hardware to ship by the end of 2021. They&#8217;re currently working on transitioning their prototypes into production, figuring out how to do things like make it easier to adjust resistance or swap the Gauntlet from user to user, and to increase the number of different exercises its sensors can detect and gamify.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sidewalkinfra.com/">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, the company which spun out of Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs to fund, develop, and own the next generation of infrastructure, has unveiled its latest project &#8212; Reslia, which focuses on upgrading the efficiency and reliability of power grids.</p>
<p>Through a $20 million equity investment in the startup OhmConnect, and an $80 million commitment to develop a demand response program leveraging OhmConnect&#8217;s technology and services across the state of California, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sidewalk-infrastructure-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sidewalk-infrastructure-partners">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> intends to plant a flag for demand-response technologies as a key pathway to ensuring stable energy grids across the country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We’re creating a virtual power plant,&#8221; said Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners co-CEO, Jonathan Winer. &#8220;With a typical power plant … it’s project finance, but for a virtual power plant… We’re basically going to subsidize the rollout of smart devices.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that people will respond to signals from the grid isn&#8217;t a new one, as Winer himself acknowledged in an interview. But the approach that Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners is taking, alongside OhmConnect, to roll out the incentives to residential customers through a combination of push notifications and payouts, is novel. &#8220;The first place people focused is on commercial and industrial buildings,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>What drew Sidewalk to the OhmConnect approach was the knowledge of the end consumer that OhmConnect&#8217;s management team brought to the table The company&#8217;s chief technology officer was the former chief technology officer of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Winer noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s cool about the OhmConnect platform is that it empowers participation,&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;Anyone can enroll in these programs. If you&#8217;re an OhmConnect user and there&#8217;s a blackout coming, we&#8217;ll give you five bucks if you turn down your thermostat for the next two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The San Francisco-based demand-response company already has 150,000 users on its platform, and has paid out something like $1 million to its customers during the brownouts and blackouts that have roiled California&#8217;s electricity grid over the past year.</p>
<p>The first collaboration between OhmConnect and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners under the Resilia banner will be what the companies are calling a &#8220;Resi-Station&#8221; &#8212; a 550 megawatt capacity demand response program that will use smart devices to power targeted energy reductions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At full scale, the companies said that the project will be the largest residential virtual power plant in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OhmConnect has shown that by linking together the savings of many individual consumers, we can reduce stress on the grid and help prevent blackouts,” said OhmConnect CEO Cisco DeVries. “This investment by SIP will allow us to bring the rewards of energy savings to hundreds of thousands of additional Californians – and at the same time build the smart energy platform of the future.” </span></p>
<p>California&#8217;s utilities need all the help they can get. Heat waves and rolling blackouts spread across the state as it confronted some of its hottest temperatures over the summer. California residents already pay among the highest residential power prices in the counry at 21 cents per kilowatt hour, versus a national average of 13 cents.</p>
<p>During times of peak stress earlier in the year, OhmConnect engaged its customers to reduce almost one gigawatt hour of total energy usage. That&#8217;s the equivalent of taking 600,000 homes off the grid for one hour.</p>
<p>If the Resilia project was rolled out at scale, the companies estimate they could provide 5 gigawatt hours of energy conservation &#8212; that&#8217;s the full amount of the energy shortfall from the year&#8217;s blackouts and the equivalent of not burning 3.8 million pounds of coal.</p>
<p>Going forward, the Resilia energy efficiency and demand response platform will scale up other infrastructure innovations as energy grids shift from centralized power to distributed, decentralized generation sources, the company said. OhmConnect looks to be an integral part of that platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The energy grid used to be uni-directional.. .we believe that in the near future the grid is going to be become bi-directional and responsive,&#8221; said Winer. &#8220;With our approach, this won’t be one investment. We’ll likely make multiple investments. [Vehicle-to-grid], micro-grid platforms, and generative design are going to be important.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finn.auto/">Finn.auto</a> — which allows people to subscribe to their car instead of owning it, and offsetting their CO₂ emissions — has raised a $24.2 million / €20 million Series A funding round. <a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a> (which has also invested in Tier Mobility), and the Zalando co-CEOs Rubin Ritter, David Schneider and Robert Gentz, are new investors in this round. All previous investors participated.</p>
<p>The funding comes just under a year since the company launched, after selling just 1,000 car subscriptions. It’s also partnered with Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Telekom AG.</p>
<p>A number of car manufacturers have launched similar subscription services powered by various providers, such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/drover" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="drover">Drover, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> LeasePlan and Wagonex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>U.K.-based startup Drover has raised a total of $40 million in funding over five rounds. Their latest Series B funding round was with Shell Ventures and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cherry-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cherry-ventures">Cherry Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Plus, there are branded services which include Audi on Demand, BMW, Citroën, DS, Jaguar Carpe, Land Rover Carpe, Mini, Volkswagen and Care by Volvo.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="na0JFHYnDa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/">UK&#8217;s Drover raises $26M to take its car subscription marketplace to Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s Drover raises $26M to take its car subscription marketplace to Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/embed/#?secret=na0JFHYnDa" data-secret="na0JFHYnDa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Digitally led subscription services have the potential to disrupt the traditional car sales model, and new startups are entering the market all the time.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/finn-b149" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="finn-b149">finn.auto <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> model is proving to appeal to environment-conscious millennials. For each car subscription, the company is offsetting the CO₂ emissions of its vehicles, meaning subscribers can drive their cars in a climate-neutral manner. It&#8217;s now expanding its range of fully electric vehicles and, in cooperation with <a href="https://www.climatepartner.com/en">ClimatePartner</a>, is supporting selected regional climate protection and development projects.</p>
<p>Key to the Munich-based startups’ play is the automation of fleet management processes and customer interactions, meaning it’s much easier and cheaper to run this kind of subscription operation.</p>
<p>Max-Josef Meier, CEO and founder of finn.auto, said: &#8220;We are delighted to have been able to bring such high-caliber investors on board and that our existing investors are cementing their confidence with the current round. Mobility with your own car becomes as easy as buying shoes on the internet. We already offer a large selection of different car brands, whose cars can be ordered online on our platform in just five minutes and at flexible runtimes. The delivery is then conveniently made to the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas Stocks, general partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/white-star-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="white-star-capital">White Star Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> added: &#8220;There is a huge opportunity globally to streamline outdated customer experiences in the automotive retail space and become the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of the automotive industry. This is something finn.auto is excellently placed to capitalize on with its offering of convenience, flexibility, value and sustainability.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> timeline is currently overrun with ads for some users, in what appears to be a glitch involving the distribution of Promoted Tweets. Typically, a Promoted Tweet &#8212; which is just a regular tweet <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/overview/what-are-promoted-tweets.html">an advertiser has paid to promote more broadly</a> &#8212; will appear just once at the top of a user&#8217;s timeline, then scroll through the timeline like any other tweet. Now, however, Promoted Tweets are popping up with increased frequency. <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1336024788985393152?from_editor=true">Some users</a> report seeing them as often as every four to six tweets, in fact. Others are reporting seeing the same Promoted Tweet more than once.</p>
<p>This indicates some sort of issue with Twitter&#8217;s ad system, as the company intends for Promoted Tweets to be targeted and relevant to the end user, without being an overly frequent part of users&#8217; timelines.</p>
<p>As Twitter&#8217;s Business website <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/overview/what-are-promoted-tweets.html">explains</a>, &#8220;we’re thoughtful in how we display Promoted Tweets, and are conservative about the number of Promoted Tweets that people see in a single day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously not the case when it seems like nearly every other tweet is now an ad &#8212; and often, a repeated ad.</p>

<p>Twitter has not yet publicly addressed the bug through its <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport">@TwitterSupport</a> account, or others that communicate with the public, like <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms">@TwitterComms</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterMktg">@TwitterMktg</a>, so it&#8217;s been unclear how many users are impacted, on which platforms or in which geographic regions. However, we&#8217;ve seen complaints coming from users both in the U.S. and abroad and on both the &#8220;Home&#8221; and &#8220;Recent Tweets&#8221; timelines.</p>
<p>Given the lack of updates and information, some Twitter users have been dealing with the influx of Promoted Tweets by muting or blocking the advertiser&#8217;s account. That could have lasting consequences, as advertisers won&#8217;t be able to again reach those users if they get blocked.</p>
<p>Twitter, reached for comment, says it&#8217;s looking into the issue. We&#8217;ll update when the company has more to share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portable audio recording solutions abound, and many recently released devices have done a lot to improve the convenience and quality of sound-recording devices you can carry in your pocket &#8212; spurred in part by smartphones and their constant improvement in video recording capabilities. A new device from Austria&#8217;s mikme, the <a href="https://shop-eu.mikme.com/collections/pockets/products/mikme-pocket">mikme pocket (€369 or just under $450 USD)</a>, offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and quality in a very portable package, delivering what might just be the ultimate pocket sound solution for reporters, podcasters, video creators and more.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>mikme pocket is small &#8212; about half the size of a smartphone, but square and probably twice as thick. It&#8217;s not as compact as something like the Rode Wireless GO, but it contains onboard memory and a Bluetooth antenna, making it possible to both record locally and transmit audio directly to a connected smartphone from up to three mikme pockets at once.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2083738,2083739"]</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The mikme pocket features a single button for control, as well as dedicated volume buttons, a 3.5mm headphone jack for monitoring audio, a micro-USB port for charging and for offloading files via physical connection, and Bluetooth pairing and power buttons. It has an integrated belt clip, as well as a 3/8&#8243; thread mount for mic stands, with an adapter included for mounting to 1/4&#8243; standard camera tripod connections.</p>
<p>In the box, mikme has also included a lavalier microphone with a mini XLR connector (which is the interface the pocket uses) and a clip and two windscreens for the mic. They also offer a &#8220;pro&#8221; lavalier mic as a separate, add-on purchase (€149 or around $180 USD), which offers improved performance versus the included lav in terms of audio quality and dynamic range.</p>

<p>The internal battery for the mikme pocket lasts up to 3.5 hours of recording time, and it can last for more than six months in standby mode between recordings, too.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p>The mikme pocket is a pretty unadorned black block, but its unassuming design is one of its strengths. It has a textured matte feel which helps with grittiness, and it&#8217;s easy to hide in dark clothing, plus the integrated belt clip works exactly as desired, ensuring the pack is easily secured to anyone you&#8217;re trying to wire for sound. It features a single large button for simplified control, which also easily shows you its connectivity status using an LED backlight.</p>
<p>Controls for more advanced functions like Bluetooth connectivity, as well as the micro-USB port, are located on the bottom, where they&#8217;re unlikely to be pressed accidentally by anyone during recording. The mini XLR interface for microphones means that once a mic is plugged in, it&#8217;s also securely locked in place and won&#8217;t be jostled out during sessions.</p>
<p>You can use the mikme pocket on its own, thanks to its 16GB of built-in local storage, but it really shines when used in tandem with the smartphone app. The app allows you to connect up to three pockets simultaneously, and provides a built-in video recorder so you can take full advantage of the recording capabilities of modern devices like the iPhone 12 to capture real-time synced audio while you film effortlessly. The mikme pocket and app also have a failsafe built in for filling in any gaps that might arise from any connection dropouts thanks to the local recording backup.</p>
<p>In terms of audio quality, the sound without adjusting any settings is excellent. Like all lavalier mics, you&#8217;ll get better results the closer you can place the actual mic capsule itself to a speaker&#8217;s mouth, but the mikme pocket produced exceptional clean-sounding, high-quality audio right out of the box &#8212; in environments that weren&#8217;t particularly sound-isolated or devoid of background noise.</p>

<p>The included mini XLR lav mic is probably good enough for the needs of most amateur and enthusiast users, while the lavalier pro is a great upgrade option for anyone looking to make the absolute most of their recordings, especially with post-processing via desktop audio editing software. The mikme app has built-in audio tweaking controls with a great visual interface that allows you to hear the effects of processing tweaks in real time, which is great for maximizing sound quality on the go before sharing clips and videos directly from your device to social networks or publishing platforms.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>From on-phone shotgun mics, to handheld recorders and much more, there are plenty of options out there for capturing audio on-the-go, but the mikme pocket is the one that offers the best balance of very high-quality sound that&#8217;s essentially immediately ready to publish, in a package that&#8217;s both extremely easy to carry anywhere with you and that offers durability and user-friendliness to suit newcomers and experts alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has just <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/auction-904-winning-bidders">published</a> the results of its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction, which sounds rather stiff but involves distributing billions to broadband providers that bring solid internet connections to under-served rural areas &#8220;on the wrong side of the digital divide.&#8221; Included is $885 million earmarked for SpaceX, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/spacex-launches-starlink-app-and-provides-pricing-and-service-info-to-early-beta-testers/">Starlink</a> satellite service could be a game-changer for places where laying fiber isn&#8217;t an option.</p>
<p>Only three other companies garnered more funds: Charter with $1.22 billion; Minnesota and Iowa provider LTD Broadband with $1.32 billion; and utility collective Rural Electric Cooperate Consortium, with $1.1 billion. Those are all traditional wireline-based broadband, and a quick perusal of the list of grantees suggests no other satellite broadband provider made the cut (180 bidders were awarded support in total).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/auction/904">The $9.2 billion auction</a> (though the specifics of the process itself are not relevant) essentially asks for bids on how much a company can provide service to a given area for, ideally with a 100 megabit downstream and 20 up. Local companies can collect the hundred grand necessary to fund a fiber line where there&#8217;s now copper, and big multi-state concerns may promise to undertake major development projects for hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Starlink has the advantage of not requiring any major construction projects to reach people out in the boonies. All that&#8217;s needed is a dish and for their home to be in the area currently covered by the rapidly expanding network of satellites in low-Earth orbit. That means the company can undercut many of its competitors — in theory anyway.</p>

<p>Starlink has not had any major rollout yet, only small test deployments, which, according to SpaceX, have gone extremely well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/spacexs-starlink-asks-potential-service-testers-for-addresses-says-private-beta-starts-this-summer/">The first wave of beta testers</a> for the service will be expected to pay $99 per month plus a one-time $500 installation fee, but what the cost of the commercial service would be is anyone&#8217;s guess (probably a bit lower).</p>
<p>In order to secure the $885 billion in the FCC&#8217;s auction, SpaceX would need to demonstrate that it can provide solid service to the areas it claims to for a reasonable price, so we can expect the costs to be in line with terrestrial broadband offerings. No other satellite broadband provider operates in that price range (Swarm offers IoT connection for $5/month, but that&#8217;s a totally different category).</p>

<p>The FCC doesn&#8217;t just knock on Elon Musk&#8217;s door with a big check, though. The company must demonstrate &#8220;periodic buildout requirements&#8221; at the locations it&#8217;s promised, at which point funds will be disbursed. This continues for a period of several years, and should help the fledgling internet provider stay alive while undergoing the rigors and uncertainties of launch. By the time the FCC cash dries up the company will ideally have several million subscribers propping it up.</p>
<p>This is &#8220;Phase I&#8221; of the auction, targeting the areas most in need of new internet service; Phase II will cover &#8220;partially-served&#8221; areas that perhaps have one good provider but no competition. Whether SpaceX will be able (or want) to make a push there is unclear, though the confidence with which the company has been approaching the market suggests it may make a limited play for these somewhat more hardened target markets.</p>
<p>The push for expanding rural broadband has been a particular focus for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-will-step-down-to-make-way-for-the-biden-administration/">outgoing FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</a>, who had this to say about its success so far:</p>
<blockquote><p>We structured this innovative and groundbreaking auction to be technologically neutral and to prioritize bids for high-speed, low-latency offerings.  We aimed for maximum leverage of taxpayer dollars and for networks that would meet consumers’ increasing broadband needs, and the results show that our strategy worked. This auction was the single largest step ever taken to bridge the digital divide and is another key success for the Commission in its ongoing commitment to universal service. I thank our staff for working so hard and so long to get this auction done on time, particularly during the pandemic.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a product manager, I’m a true believer that you can solve any problem with the right product and process, even one as gnarly as the multiheaded hydra that is microservice overhead.</p>
<p>Working for Vertex Ventures US this summer was my chance to put this to the test. After interviewing 30+ industry experts from a diverse set of companies — Facebook, Fannie Mae, Confluent, Salesforce and more — and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/13z4d063621t087/Vertex%20Ventures%20US%20Webinar%20-%20The%20State%20Of%20Microservices.mp3?dl=0">hosting a webinar</a> with the co-founders of PagerDuty, LaunchDarkly and OpsLevel, we were able to answer three main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do teams adopt microservices?</li>
<li>What are the main challenges organizations face?</li>
<li>Which strategies, processes and tools do companies use to overcome these challenges?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>How do teams adopt microservices?</strong></h2>
<p>Out of dozens of companies we spoke with, only two had not yet started their journey to microservices, but both were actively considering it. Industry trends mirror this as well. In an O’Reilly <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png">survey of 1500+ respondents</a>, more than 75% had started to adopt microservices.</p>
<p>It’s rare for companies to start building with microservices from the ground up. Of the companies we spoke with, only one had done so. Some startups, such as LaunchDarkly, plan to build their infrastructure using microservices, but turned to a monolith once they realized the high cost of overhead.</p>
<p>“We were spending more time effectively building and operating a system for distributed systems versus actually building our own services so we pulled back hard,&#8221; said John Kodumal, CTO and co-founder of LaunchDarkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an example, the things we were trying to do in mesosphere, they were impossible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We couldn’t do any logging. Zero downtime deploys were impossible. There were so many bugs in the infrastructure and we were spending so much time debugging the basic things that we weren’t building our own service.”</p>
<p>As a result, it’s more common for companies to start with a monolith and move to microservices to scale their infrastructure with their organization. Once a company reaches ~30 developers, most begin decentralizing control by moving to a microservice architecture.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Teams may take different routes to arrive at a microservice architecture, but they tend to face a common set of challenges once they get there.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Large companies with established monoliths are keen to move to microservices, but costs are high and the transition can take years. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atlassian" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atlassian">Atlassian’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform infrastructure is in microservices, but legacy monoliths in Jira and Confluence persist despite ongoing decomposition efforts. Large companies often get stuck in this transition. However, a combination of strong, top-down strategy combined with bottoms-up dev team support can help companies, such as Freddie Mac, make substantial progress.</p>
<p>Some startups, like Instacart, first shifted to a modular monolith that allows the code to reside in a single repository while beginning the process of distributing ownership of discrete code functions to relevant teams. This enables them to mitigate the overhead associated with a microservice architecture by balancing the visibility of having a centralized repository and release pipeline with the flexibility of discrete ownership over portions of the codebase.</p>
<h2><strong>What challenges do teams face?</strong></h2>
<p>Teams may take different routes to arrive at a microservice architecture, but they tend to face a common set of challenges once they get there. John Laban, CEO and co-founder of OpsLevel, which helps teams build and manage microservices told us that “with a distributed or microservices based architecture your teams benefit from being able to move independently from each other, but there are some gotchas to look out for.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the linked <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1.png">O’Reilly chart</a> shows how the top 10 challenges organizations face when adopting microservices are shared by 25%+ of respondents. While we discussed some of the adoption blockers above, feedback from our interviews highlighted issues around managing complexity.</p>
<p>The lack of a coherent definition for a service can cause teams to generate unnecessary overhead by creating too many similar services or spreading related services across different groups. One company we spoke with went down the path of decomposing their monolith and took it too far. Their service definitions were too narrow, and by the time decomposition was complete, they were left with 4,000+ microservices to manage. They then had to backtrack and consolidate down to a more manageable number.</p>
<p>Defining too many services creates unnecessary organizational and technical silos while increasing complexity and overhead. Logging and monitoring must be present on each service, but with ownership spread across different teams, a lack of standardized tooling can create observability headaches. It’s challenging for teams to get a single-pane-of-glass view with too many different interacting systems and services that span the entire architecture.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re not familiar with Jamstack, it’s a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. It lets you take advantage of global edge networks with a focus on performance.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a very famous pop artist and you’re launching your new album on your website tomorrow. You expect to get a huge traffic spike and a ton of orders.</p>
<p>If you also happen to be a web developer, you could develop a Jamstack website to make sure that your website remains available and loads quickly. Instead of using a traditional content management system to host your content and deliver it to your users, a Jamstack framework lets you decouple the front end from the back end.</p>
<p>You could write a few posts in your content management system and then deploy your website update. Your Jamstack application will prebuild static pages based on what you just wrote. Those pages will be cached on a global edge network and served in a few milliseconds across the world. It&#8217;s like photocopying a letter instead of writing a new copy every time somebody wants to read it.</p>
<p>But what if somebody wants to buy your new album on the buy page? On that page, there will be a checkout module, which is dynamic content that can’t be cached. You can leverage a payments API, such as Stripe, so that the user doesn’t load content from your server at all.</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but many companies have been going down this path. For static content, everything is prebuilt and cached. For dynamic content, companies build microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong’s</a> screenshots, Cloudflare Pages lets you deploy sites with a simple Git commit. It integrates directly with your GitHub repository if you’re hosting your source code on the platform.</p>
<p>You can configure a Node.js build command that will be executed every time you change something to your code. Once the build process is done, your website is accessible to your end users.</p>
<p>There will be a free tier for Cloudflare Pages, which lets you generate 500 builds per month. Above that quota, Cloudflare will most likely let you pay for more builds and more features.</p>
<p>By default, Cloudflare gives you a subdomain name to try out the service — your-website-name.pages.dev. Of course, you can configure your own domain name and combine Cloudflare Pages with other Cloudflare products.</p>
<p>You can already read Cloudflare Pages’ documentation, as spotted by Jane Manchun Wong. So it sounds like Cloudflare Pages could launch sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><i>Update: While the documentation site was accessible at the time of publication, it is no longer accessible.</i></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The way a team functions and communicates dictates the operational efficiency of a startup and sets the scene for its culture. It’s way more important than what social events and perks are offered, so it’s the responsibility of a founder and/or CEO to provide their team with a technology approach that will empower them to achieve and succeed — now and in the future.</p>
<p>With that in mind, moving to the cloud might seem like a no-brainer because of its huge benefits around flexibility, accessibility and the potential to rapidly scale, while keeping budgets in check.</p>
<p>But there’s an important consideration here: Cloud providers won’t magically give you efficient teams<em>.</em></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Designing a startup for scale means investing in the right technology today to underpin growth for tomorrow and beyond.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It will get you going in the right direction, but you need to think even farther ahead. Designing a startup for scale means investing in the right technology <em>today</em> to underpin growth for tomorrow and beyond. Let’s look at how you approach and manage your cloud infrastructure will impact the effectiveness of your teams and your ability to scale.</p>
<h2><strong>Hindsight is 20/20</strong></h2>
<p>Adopting cloud is easy, but adopting it properly with best practices and in a secure way? Not so much. You might think that when you move to cloud, the cloud providers will give you everything you need to succeed. But even though they’re there to provide a wide breadth of services, these services won’t necessarily have the depth that you will need to run efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Yes, your cloud infrastructure is working now, but think beyond the first prototype or alpha and toward production. Considering where you want to get to, and not just where you are, will help you avoid costly mistakes. You definitely don’t want to struggle through redefining processes and ways of working when you’re also managing time sensitivities and multiple teams.</p>
<p>If you don’t think ahead, you’ll have to put all new processes in. It will take a whole lot longer, cost more money and cause a lot more disruption to teams than if you do it earlier.</p>
<p>For any founder, making strategic technology decisions <strong><em>right now</em></strong> should be a primary concern. It feels more natural to put off those decisions until you come face to face with the problem, but you’ll just end up needing to redo everything as you scale and cause your teams a world of hurt. If you don’t give this problem attention at the beginning, you’re just scaling the problems with the team. Flaws are then embedded within your infrastructure, and they’ll continue to scale with the teams. When these things are rushed, corners are cut and you will end up spending even more time and money on your infrastructure.</p>
<h2><strong>Build effective teams and reduce bottlenecks</strong></h2>
<p>When you’re making strategic decisions on how to approach your technology stack and cloud infrastructure, the biggest consideration should be what makes an effective team. Given that, keep these things top of mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed of delivery: </strong>Having developers able to self-serve cloud infrastructure with best practices built-in will enable speed. Development tools that factor in visibility and communication integrations for teams will give transparency on how they are iterating, problems, bugs or integration failures.</li>
<li><strong>Speed of testing</strong>: This is all about ensuring fast feedback loops as your team works on critical new iterations and features. Developers should be able to test as much as possible locally and through continuous integration systems before they are ready for code review.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting problems</strong>: Good logging, monitoring and observability services, gives teams awareness of issues and the ability to resolve problems quickly or reproduce customer complaints in order to develop fixes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to expand its global Azure data center presence at a rapid clip. After announcing new regions in Austria and Taiwan in October, the company today revealed its plans to launch a new region <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/microsoft-announces-plans-to-establish-a-new-datacenter-region-in-denmark-to-accelerate-the-countrys-green-digital-transformation/">in Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>As with many of Microsoft&#8217;s recent announcements, the company is also attaching a commitment to provide digital skills to 200,000 people in the country (in this case, by 2024).</p>
<p>“With this investment, we’re taking the next step in our longstanding commitment to provide Danish society and businesses with the digital tools, skills and infrastructure needed to drive sustainable growth, innovation, and job creation. We’re investing in Denmark’s digital leap into the future – all in a way that supports the country’s ambitious climate goals and economic recovery,” said Nana Bule, general manager, Microsoft Denmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2083663" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2083663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png" alt="Azure regions" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png 1689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2083663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new data center, which will be powered by 100% renewable energy and feature multiple availability zones, will feature support for what has now become the standard set of Microsoft cloud products: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/azure" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="azure">Azure, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.</p>
<p>As usual, the idea here is to provide low-latency access to Microsoft&#8217;s tools and services. It has long been Microsoft&#8217;s strategy to blanket the globe with local data centers. Europe is a prime example of this, with regions (both operational and announced) in about a dozen countries already. In the U.S., Azure currently offers 13 regions (including three exclusively for government agencies), with a new region on the West Coast coming soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a proud day for Microsoft in Denmark,&#8221; said Brad Smith, president, Microsoft. &#8220;Building a hyper-scale datacenter in Denmark means we’ll store Danish data in Denmark, make computing more accessible at even faster speeds, secure data with our world-class security, protect data with Danish privacy laws, and do more to provide to the people of Denmark our best digital skills training. This investment reflects our deep appreciation of Denmark’s green and digital leadership globally and our commitment to its future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> has launched a new set of features today called the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-data-localization-suite/">Data Localization Suite</a>. Companies on the Enterprise plan can choose to enable the features through an add-on.</p>
<p>With the Data Localization Suite, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is making it easier to control where your data is stored and if you’re authorized to view data depending on from where you are accessing it. It’s a feature that lets you take advantage of Cloudflare’s products, such as serverless infrastructure, while complying with local and industry-specific regulation.</p>
<p>For instance, the Data Localization Suite seems particularly relevant following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">this year’s EU ruling</a> that ended the Privacy Shield. If you’re operating in a highly regulated industry, such as healthcare and legal, you may have some specific data requirements as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let’s say you’re building an application that should store data in the European Union exclusively. You could choose to run your application in a single data center, or a single cloud region. But that doesn’t scale well if you expect to get customers all around the world. You could also suffer from outages.</p>
<p>With Cloudflare’s approach, everything is encrypted at rest and in transit (if you enforce mandatory TLS encryption). You can choose to manage your private keys yourself, or you can choose to set different rules for your private keys.</p>
<p>For instance, a private key that lets you inspect traffic could be accessible from a European data center exclusively. Now that the Privacy Shield is invalid, this setup makes it easier to comply with European regulation.</p>
<p>Cloudflare inspects network requests in order to know what to do with them. For instance, the company tries to reject malicious bot requests automatically. You can choose to inspect those requests in a region in particular. If a malicious bot is running on a server in the U.S., the request will be sent to the closest Cloudflare data center in the U.S., routed to a data center in Europe and then inspected.</p>
<p>As for traffic logs and metadata, you can use Edge Log Delivery to send logs directly from Cloudflare’s edge network to a storage bucket or an on-premise data center. It doesn’t transit through Cloudflare’s core data centers at all.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re using the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/">recently announced</a> Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects, you can configure jurisdiction restriction. If you run an app on Cloudflare’s serverless infrastructure, you can choose to avoid storing durable objects in some locations for regulation purposes.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are several tools and services in the Data Localization Suite. Some of them have already been live and others are brand new. But it’s interesting to see that Cloudflare is thinking about locality even though it thinks serverless computing and edge data centers are the future.</p>

<p>This gives us a good amount of ground to cover. So, we&#8217;ll dig into Airbnb&#8217;s new price range first, working to understand how richly investors are valuing the American home-sharing unicorn. We&#8217;ll repeat the experiment with C3.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/working-to-understand-c3-ais-growth-story/">a company we find utterly fascinating</a>. Then we&#8217;ll calculate valuation ranges for both Upstart, a consumer lending fintech, and Wish, an e-commerce giant, to see where they stand.</p>

<p>There are other IPOs in the wings: We&#8217;re still waiting on early pricing information from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Roblox, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">DoorDash raised its range last week</a>.</p>

C3.ai and DoorDash should price tomorrow and trade Wednesday. Airbnb should price Wednesday and trade Thursday. Upstart will price next Tuesday and trade the following day.</p>
<p>In normal times, we&#8217;d take each element of today&#8217;s IPO news fusillade and parse it in its own post. But we only have 10 fingers, so let&#8217;s double-time through the numbers and get to what matters while you drink coffee. To work!</p>
<h2>Airbnb and C3.ai</h2>
<p>Public investors are bidding shares of both Airbnb and C3.ai up ahead of their debuts.</p>
<p>This morning, C3.ai, a company that sells enterprise AI technology, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020017136/c3ais-1a3.htm">raised</a> its IPO price range from $31-$34 to $36-$38 per share. It both raised and tightened its range, the latter often happening as a company gets a better handle on where demand lies as it ramps toward final pricing and eventual trading.</p>
<p>There are two ways to calculate the company&#8217;s new valuation range. The first uses the company&#8217;s nondiluted, expected post-IPO share count of 98,655,627, a figure that includes a little more than 2 million shares reserved for underwriters. At that share count, C3.ai would be worth between $3.57 billion and $3.77 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The state of California has now expanded access of its CA Notify app to all in the state, after originally deploying the app in a pilot program at UC Berkeley in November, which later expanded to other UC campuses. The statewide launch of the app, announced by California Governor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on Monday, means that the tool based on Apple and Google&#8217;s exposure notification API will be available for download and opt-in use to anyone with a compatible iPhone or Android device as of this Thursday, December 10.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> jointly developed exposure notification API uses Bluetooth to determine contact between confirmed COVID-positive individuals and others, alerting users to potential exposure without storing or transmitting any data related to their identity or location. The system uses a randomized, rolling identifier to communicate possible exposure to other devices, and individual state health authorities can customize specific details like how close, and for how long, individuals need to be in contact in order to qualify as an exposure risk.</p>
<p>In the case of California, the state has set contact with a confirmed COVID-19 positive individual of within six feet for a period of 15 minutes or more as meriting an exposure notification. Users who receive a positive COVID-19 test will get a text message from the Department of Public Health for the state that contains a code they input in the CA Notify app in order to trigger an alert broadcast to any phones that met the criteria above during the prior 14 days (the period during which the virus is transmissible).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As mentioned, there&#8217;s no personal information transmitted from a user&#8217;s device via the notification system, and it&#8217;s a fully opt-in arrangement. Other states have already deployed exposure notification apps based on the Apple/Google API, as have many other countries around the world. It&#8217;s not a replacement for a contact-tracing system, in which healthcare professionals attempt to determine who a COVID-19 patient came in contact with to find out how they might have contracted the virus, and to whom they may spread it, but it is a valuable component of a comprehensive tracing program that can improve its efficacy and success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are T-minus one week until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a> lifts off on December 16-17. Join the global space community’s leading experts, brightest visionaries and rising stars for two days dedicated to space technology and exploration — and the opportunities they offer.</p>
<p>Speaking of opportunity, you don’t want to miss our University Showcase sessions featuring the latest research from top universities, hosted by The Aerospace Corporation. Hold up now, what’s that? You don’t have a pass yet? Don’t fret, simply buy a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=true">late-registration ticket</a> or take advantage of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=true">discounts for groups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=true">students</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=true">active military/government employees</a>.

<p>Okay, back to the University Showcase sessions. Up until now, space exploration and technology has always been tied to orbiting, observing and reporting back to earth. But it’s time to take on a new, expanded commitment — to boldly go into space — and stay there, i.e. <strong>space exploration, commerce and habitation</strong>. It means moving humans beyond planet Earth and out into the solar system. That requires bold people building new technology and forging the next generation of space capabilities. Talk about a galactic-sized goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The University Showcase sessions — in two parts, one on each day of the conference — will feature scientists and academics from USC, MIT, UCLA, ASU and Caltech, Aerospace Corporation’s partners, sharing insights on their space research and highlighting a range of emerging space technologies.</p>
<p>Through partnership with the Aerospace Corporation, emerging capabilities — in communication, navigation and space exploration — can be evaluated and integrated into government missions with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.</p>
<p>As always, TechCrunch delivers the top experts, and University Showcase sessions are no exception. Over the course of the two sessions, you’ll hear from Randy Villahermosa (general manager &amp; executive director of Innovation, The Aerospace Corporation), Dr. Richard Linares (co-director, Space Systems Lab, MIT), David A. Barnhart (director, Space Engineering Research Center; Research Professor, USC), Kerri Cahoy (associate professor, Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, MIT), Bethany Ehlmann (professor of Planetary Science, Caltech &#8211; Lunar Trailblazer Mission), Craig Hardgrove, (assistant professor, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University) and Dr. James M. Weygand (space physicist, Department of Earth, Planetary &amp; Space Science, UCLA).</p>

This means Google&#8217;s flagship smart speaker devices, including Nest Audio, Nest Hub Max and Nest Mini, will now be able to play Apple Music songs, albums and playlists by way of voice commands, as will others.</p>
<p>The update makes Google&#8217;s own smart speakers more competitive with both Apple&#8217;s HomePod and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">newer HomePod Mini,</a> as well as Alexa-enabled smart speakers like the Echo, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/apple-music-amazon-echo/">supported Apple Music since late 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To stream from Apple Music, Google device owners will need to first link their Apple Music account in the Google Home app then optionally set it as their default music service. After doing so, they&#8217;ll be able to use voice commands like &#8220;Hey Google, play New Music Daily playlist&#8221; or &#8220;Hey Google, play Rap Life playlist,&#8221; for example, or ask for any other specific song, artist or playlist the service offers.</p>
<p>Users will also be able to ask Google Assistant to stream music based on genre, mood or activity, or they can request Apple Music to stream from their own library of songs by saying, &#8220;Hey Google, play my library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple Music will also work in multi-device households, allowing Google device owners to stream across all their speakers at once, or to move music from one device to the others.</p>
<p>Today, many Google smart speaker owners may use a third-party service like Spotify, Pandora or Deezer &#8212; which are already supported in the Google Home app. But those who had been longtime Google Play Music customers have more recently had to make a decision as to whether to jump ship to a new service or stay within Google&#8217;s ecosystem, following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity/"> Google Play Music service shut down</a> which saw the service merge with YouTube Music. As a result, some former Google Play Music customers moved to Apple Music to leverage its library feature.</p>

<p>Apple Music allows users to have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204926">up to 100,000 songs</a> in their music library, which appeals to some of Google Play Music&#8217;s past customers. It also offers more than 70 million songs for on-demand, ad-free streaming.</p>
<p>Google says the new Apple Music support is rolling out starting today to supported devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Tecton.ai">Tecton.ai</a>, the startup founded by three former Uber engineers who wanted to bring the machine learning feature store idea to the masses, announced a $35 million Series B today, just seven months after announcing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/tecton-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-series-a-to-build-operational-machine-learning-platform/"> their $20 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>When we spoke to the company in April, it was working with early customers in a beta version of the product, but today, in addition to the funding, they are also announcing the general availability of the platform.</p>
<p>As with their Series A, this round has <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sequoia Capital co-leading the investment. The company has now raised $60 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason these two firms are so committed to Tecton is the specific problem around machine learning the company is trying to solve. &#8220;We help organizations put machine learning into production. That&#8217;s the whole goal of our company, helping someone build an operational machine learning application, meaning an application that&#8217;s powering their fraud system or something real for them [&#8230;] and making it easy for them to build and deploy and maintain,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Mike Del Balso explained.</p>
<p>They do this by providing the concept of a feature store, an idea they came up with and which is becoming a machine learning category unto itself. Just last week, AWS announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">the Sagemaker Feature store</a>, which the company saw as major validation of their idea.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/#:~:text=A%20feature%20store%20is%20an,for%20training%20and%20inference%20purposes">Tecton defines it</a>, a feature store is an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.</p>
<p>Del Balso says this works hand-in-hand with the other layers of a machine learning stack. &#8220;When you build a machine learning application, you use a machine learning stack that could include a model training system, maybe a model serving system or an MLOps kind of layer that does all the model management, and then you have a feature management layer, a feature store which is us &#8212; and so we&#8217;re an end-to-end life cycle for the data pipelines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With so much money behind the company it is growing fast, going from 17 employees to 26 since we spoke in April, with plans to more than double that number by the end of next year. Del Balso says he and his co-founders are committed to building a diverse and inclusive company, but he acknowledges it&#8217;s not easy to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually something that we have a primary recruiting initiative on. It&#8217;s very hard, and it takes a lot of effort, it&#8217;s not something that you can just make like a second priority and not take it seriously,&#8221; he said. To that end, the company has sponsored and attended diversity hiring conferences and has focused its recruiting efforts on finding a diverse set of candidates, he said.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of startups we&#8217;ve spoken to, Del Balso wants to return to an office setup as soon as it is feasible to do so, seeing it as a way to build more personal connections between employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble introduced a new feature</a> that would prevent bad actors from using the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from victims. Now Tinder has done something similar. The company <a href="https://blog.gotinder.com/a-note-from-our-trust-and-safety-team-updates-on-how-were-making-tinder-a-safer-place/">announced</a> on Friday it will soon roll out an update to its app that will make it easier for users to report someone who has used the unmatch feature in an effort to get away with their abuse. But in Tinder&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s only making it easier for users to learn how to report the violation, rather than giving the victims a button in the chat interface to report the abuse more directly.</p>
<p>Tinder notes that users have always been able to report anyone on the app at any time &#8212; even if the person had used the unmatch feature. But few users likely knew how to do so, as there weren&#8217;t obvious explanations in the app&#8217;s user interface about how to report a chat after it disappeared.</p>
<p>With the update, Tinder says it will soon add its &#8220;Safety Center&#8221; shield icon within the Match List, where the chats take place. This will direct users to the Safety Center in the app, where they can learn how to report users who aren&#8217;t displayed on the Match List because they used the unmatch feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2083566" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083566" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2083566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083566" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>The updates to both Tinder and Bumble came about following an investigation by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-12/tinder-dating-app-helps-sexual-predators-hide-four-corners/12722732?nw=0">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, which found that 48 out of 231 survey respondents who had used Tinder said they had reported other users for some kind of sexual offense. But only 11 of those reports had received any replies, and even fewer offered specific information about what was being done.</p>
<p>The story had also explained how bad actors would take advantage of the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from their victims. After unmatching, their chat history would disappear from the victim&#8217;s phone, which would have allowed the user to more easily report the abuse to Tinder or even to law enforcement, if needed.</p>
<p>Though Tinder was the focus of the story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble quickly followed up</a> to say it was changing how unmatching on its app would work. Instead of having the chat disappear when unmatched, Bumble users are now shown a message that says the other person has ended the chat. Here, they&#8217;re given the option to also either delete the chat or report it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bumble&#8217;s new feature prevents bad actors from using &#8216;unmatch&#8217; to hide from their victims&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/embed/#?secret=u397bRVXDZ" data-secret="u397bRVXDZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The ability to report the chat directly from the messaging inbox is what makes Bumble&#8217;s solution more useful. Tinder, on the other hand, is just redirecting users to what&#8217;s essentially its help documentation &#8212; the Tinder Safety Center &#8212; to learn how to go about making such a report. The addition of this extra step could end up being a deterrent to making these reports, as it&#8217;s less straightforward than simply clicking a button that reads &#8220;Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinder also didn&#8217;t address the other issues raised by the investigation, which said many reports lacked follow-up or clear information about what actions Tinder was taking to address the issues.</p>
<p>Instead, the company says that it will continue to acknowledge when reports are received to let the member making the report know an appropriate action will be taken. Tinder added it will also direct users to trained resources for crisis counseling and survivor support; remove accounts if it finds account holders have been reported for violent crimes; and will continue to work with law enforcement on investigations, when required. These actions, however, should be baseline features for any dating app, not points of pride.</p>
<p>Tinder stressed, too, that it would not remove the unmatch feature, which is necessary for safety and privacy of its members. That seems to miss the point of what users&#8217; complaints were about. Tinder users were not angry or concerned that an unmatching feature existed in the first place, but that it was being used by bad actors to avoid repercussions for their abuse.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t say precisely when the changes to the dating app would roll out, beyond the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Tinder&#8217;s parent company also <a href="https://newsroom.mtch.com/2020-12-07-Match-Group-and-RAINN-Enter-Into-Groundbreaking-Partnership-on-Dating-Safety">announced a partnership with RAINN,</a> a large anti-sexual violence organization, to conduct &#8220;a comprehensive review of sexual misconduct reporting, moderation, and response across Match Group&#8217;s dating platforms&#8221; and &#8220;to work together to improve current safety systems and tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization will review Tinder, Hinge and Plenty of Fish to determine what best practices should be. Match says the partnership begins today and will continue through 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences, and we want to do our part to create safer communities on our platforms and beyond,&#8221; said <a href="https://mtch.com/match-group-appoints-tracey-breeden-as-head-of-safety-and-social-advocacy/">Tracey Breeden</a>, head of Safety and Social Advocacy for Match Group, in a statement. &#8220;By working together with courageous, thought-leading organizations like RAINN, we will up level safety processes and strengthen our responses for survivors of sexual assault. Safety challenges touch every corner of society. We are committed to creating actionable solutions by working collaboratively with experts to innovate on meaningful, industry-led safety approaches,&#8221; she added.</p>
