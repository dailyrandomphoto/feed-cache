										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vaccine misinformation has been around since well before the pandemic, but ensuring that anti-scientific conspiracies don&#8217;t get boosted online is more crucial than ever as the world races against the spread of a deadly, changing virus.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook says it will expand the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims">criteria it uses to take down false vaccine claims</a>. Under the new rules, which Facebook said it made in consultation with groups like the World Health Organization, the company will remove posts claiming that COVID-19 vaccines aren&#8217;t effective, that it&#8217;s &#8220;safer to get the disease&#8221; and the widely debunked longstanding anti-vaxxer claim that vaccines could cause autism.</p>
<p>Facebook says it will place a &#8220;particular focus&#8221; on enforcement against groups, Pages, groups and accounts that break the rules, noting that they may be removed from the platform outright.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the coming weeks we&#39;ll be making it harder to find accounts in search that discourage people from getting vaccinated on Instagram. These changes won&#39;t happen overnight, but will help keep our community safe and informed, especially as more claims around the vaccine emerge.</p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="üò∑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1358851016553332738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook took steps to<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#latest"> limit COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in December</a>, preparing the platform for the vaccine rollout while still lagging well behind the rampant spread of anti-vaccine claims. The company began removing posts containing some misinformation about the vaccine, including &#8220;false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips&#8221; and content claiming that the vaccine is being tested on portions of the population without their consent.</p>
<p>Why this kind of stuff didn&#8217;t already fall under Facebook&#8217;s rules against COVID-19 misinformation is anyone&#8217;s guess. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/">came out of the gate early</a> in the pandemic with a new set of policies intended to prevent an explosion of potentially deadly COVID-related conspiracies, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-19-vaccines-face-varied-powerful-misinformation-movement-online-n1249378">time</a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook_coronavirus_vaccine_misinformation.php">time again</a> the company fails to evenly and firmly enforce its own rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Income-share agreements, or ISAs, have been gathering force as an alternative financial model for students, particularly at non-traditional schools like coding boot camps and trade schools. We‚Äôve done <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/31/how-income-share-agreements-will-spark-the-rise-of-career-accelerators/">some pretty deep dives into the space</a> over the years in terms of how these loan products incentivize students and colleges to work together for better professional outcomes. Given their novelty though, one of the largest barriers to wide adoption remains the lack of capital for these models.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ID69aPXKTR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/31/how-income-share-agreements-will-spark-the-rise-of-career-accelerators/">How income share agreements will spark the rise of career accelerators</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs starting to change, and companies like <a href="https://joinblair.com">Blair</a> are leading the charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blair told TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in a new debt facility to fund what it is dubbing ‚ÄúBlair Capital‚Äù to fund ISAs at partner institutions. The money came from an undisclosed investor, which was described by Blair CEO Mike Mahlkow as an ‚Äúinstitutional capital partner with more than $10 billion under management.‚Äù</p>
<p>My colleague Mike Butcher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/">first profiled Blair when it was coming out of YC back in summer 2019</a>. When Blair first got started by co-founders Mahlkow, Constantin Schreiber and David Nordhausen, it was focused exclusively on the direct-to-consumer market for ISAs. The idea was that students would go to Blair and secure an ISA with a set amount of upfront cash to cover tuition and cost of living, and then choose a school to attend. Underwriting was based on the future income potential of the student.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="av5ZZ6C2N6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/">Launching out of YC, Blair is aiming to reshape the financing of college tuition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launching out of YC, Blair is aiming to reshape the financing of college tuition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/embed/#?secret=av5ZZ6C2N6" data-secret="av5ZZ6C2N6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blair‚Äôs technology platform allowed it to service ISAs for students, such as collecting their payments, tracking their requirements and giving them updates on their remaining terms. But to really scale up the platform, Blair needed capital to actually underwrite ISAs and increase loan volumes on its platform.</p>
<p>So it looked to raise a debt facility ‚Äî and then COVID-19 hit. ‚ÄúIt was very, very, difficult to raise any kind of debt capital for direct-to-consumer ISAs,‚Äù Mahlkow explained in the milieu of a pandemic. But, ‚Äúwe got a lot of inbound demand from education institutions,‚Äù and particularly from alternative schools like coding boot camps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110445" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110445" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg 1768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=1536,938 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110445" class="wp-caption-text">Blair&#8217;s team. Photo via Blair.</p></div></p>
<p>So Blair rejiggered its platform (now dubbed Blair Servicing) away from D2C lending to being a technology servicing layer for schools offering ISAs as part of their programs. From there, it constructed Blair Capital, this new $100 million facility which can be used by its partner schools to fund their own ISA programs. That means these schools won‚Äôt have to raise their own debt capital for their ISAs if they don‚Äôt want to.</p>
<p>Unlike Blair‚Äôs original approach focused on consumers, underwriting for ISAs is now based on the quality of an individual school, and even more specifically an individual program. So rather than underwriting a person, Blair knows that certain programs have a given return profile and can underwrite terms of the ISA to fit that risk.</p>
<p>Terms can vary widely between programs. Mahlkow explained that the company more or less has merely floors and ceilings on terms but otherwise is flexible. For instance, the company won‚Äôt do income shares above 20% (and often gets queasy even going near that number), and there are repayment caps and limits on repayment time periods as well, with most ISAs it offers being between 1-2 years or a maximum of three years.</p>
<p>Alternative schools with track records of student achievement can use Blair Capital right away. For newer schools without the same operating history, Blair will help guide those schools to build the early track record they need so that the company can underwrite their ISAs in the future. Either way, all schools can use Blair Servicing to handle their loans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110444" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110444" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,1099 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110444" class="wp-caption-text">The school dashboard within Blair Servicing. Photo via Blair.</p></div></p>
<p>Blair Servicing takes a percentage fee of the money that flows back from an ISA after graduation, while Blair Capital takes an origination fee plus joins in the upside of the ISA itself. The goal is to incentive-align the loans for all parties involved.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in SF, remains lean, at six employees. With $100 million capital to fund ISAs though, it hopes to have an outsized impact on this burgeoning industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Micromobility startup <a href="https://helbiz.com/">Helbiz</a>, which now operates across Europe and the USA, is merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to become a publicly listed company, giving it a war chest to potentially roll-up smaller competitors in the space, as well as the resources to expand into &#8220;cloud&#8221; or &#8220;ghost&#8221; kitchens as part of a move into food delivery.</p>
<p>Helbiz intends to merge with GreenVision Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: GRNV) in the second quarter of 2021. The combined entity will be named Helbiz Inc. and will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the new ticker symbol, &#8220;HLBZ.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transaction includes $30 million PIPE anchored by institutional investors and approximately $80 million in net proceeds will be fed into Helbiz‚Äôs micromobility and advertising businesses, which have 2.7 million users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Helbiz says the merged entity will have a valuation of $408 million, and by run Helbiz‚Äôs existing management under CEO Salvatore Palella.</p>
<p>Palella said: ‚ÄúThrough this transaction, we‚Äôre committed to fulfilling our vision in revolutionizing transport by using micromobility to become a seamless last-mile solution.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further revealed to me that the company plans to establish &#8220;ghost kitchens&#8221; in Milan and Washington, DC later this year, with the aim of introducing a five-minute delivery time.</p>
<p>Helbiz has tried to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/as-europe-slowly-unlocks-e-scooter-startups-like-helbiz-are-wooing-with-offers/">differentiate</a> itself from other players like Lime and Bird by offering e-scooters, e-bicycles and e-mopeds all on one platform.</p>
<p>Key to Helbiz‚Äôs offering is an integrated geofencing platform that tends to appeal to city authorities who don‚Äôt want scooters left in random places, as well as a swappable battery that enables easier charging of the devices. Its subscription service allows users to take unlimited 30-minute trips on its e-bikes and e-scooters every month.</p>

<p>In Europe the company currently operates a fleet of e-scooters and e-bicycles in Milan, Turin, Verona, Rome, Madrid and Belgrade, and in the U.S. it operates in Washington, DC, Alexandria, Arlington and Miami.</p>
<p>David Fu, chairman, and CEO of GreenVision, commented: ‚ÄúHelbiz has distinguished itself as the only company to offer e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds all on one user-friendly platform‚Ä¶ Helbiz has a proven and capital-light business model that combines hardware, software, and services with extensive customer relationships.‚Äù</p>

<p>To do so, you first download the Goody mobile app for iOS or Android, then browse across the hundreds of brands and products it offers. You also can filter these by occasion, like birthdays or holidays, or by a specific need, such as gifts to say congratulations or get well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110422" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110422" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110422" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goody</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you find a gift you like, you just enter the recipient&#8217;s phone number. Goody then sends a text that lets the recipient know that you&#8217;ve sent them something. The recipient clicks the link to accept the gift, which opens a website where they can see what you&#8217;ve selected, while also customizing any specific options &#8212; like their clothing size, color preferences or what flavor of cupcakes they&#8217;d like, for example.</p>
<p>Here, they also provide their shipping address, and the gift is sent. Afterwards, they can choose to send a thank you note, as well.</p>
<p>What makes this experience work is that &#8212; unlike some gifting startups in the past &#8212; Goody doesn&#8217;t require the recipient to download an app, nor do you need to know anything other than a phone number of the person you want to send a gift to.</p>

<p>The idea for Goody comes from co-founder and serial entrepreneur and startup investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/edward-lando">Edward Lando,</a> whose prior company, YC-backed GovPredict, was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201102005838/en/Phone2Action-Acquires-GovPredict-to-Provide-the-Most-Comprehensive-Solution-for-Government-Affairs-and-Grassroots-Advocacy-Teams">recently acquired</a>. He was also the first investor in Misfits Market, serves on the board at Atom Finance and is a managing partner at <a href="https://www.pareto20.com/">Pareto Holdings</a>, based in Miami, where Lando now lives.</p>
<p>Joining him on Goody are Even.com tech lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktbao/">Mark Bao</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lclinden/">Lee Linden</a>, who notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-acquires-karma/">sold his prior gifting startup Karma Gifts to Facebook</a> back in 2012.</p>
<p>Lando says he was interested in working on the idea because he loves to send gifts, but thinks there&#8217;s a lot of friction involved with the process as it stands today. Meanwhile, gifts that are easier to send, like gift cards, can lack a personal touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing for us is for Goody to feel highly personal,&#8221; Lando explains. &#8220;If someone sends you something through Goody [it should feel like], wow, they really thought about me &#8212; they picked out something for me. We don&#8217;t want it to feel like someone is just sending you a dollar value,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The mobile app launched in mid-December and now works with a couple dozen brand partners. Many of these are in the direct-to-consumer space or are otherwise emerging companies, like non-alcoholic aperitif <a href="https://drinkghia.com/">Ghia</a>,¬†workout experience <a href="https://www.theclass.com/">The Class</a>, pet company <a href="https://fablepets.com/">Fable</a>, wellness company <a href="https://moonjuice.com/">Moon Juice,</a> <a href="https://www.raakachocolate.com/">Raaka Chocolate</a> and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110426" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110426" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110426" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goody</p></div></p>
<p>Goody&#8217;s model involves a revenue share with its partners, where its cut increases the more sales its makes on the partner&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Brands are interested in working with Goody, Lando explains, because it can help them acquire new customers with little effort on their part.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so many direct-to-consumer brands these days &#8212; thousands of them &#8212; selling online &#8212; coffee, chocolate, all these cool things,&#8221; Lando says. &#8220;And for now, their only way of getting discovered is buying ads on Facebook. We&#8217;re another way for people to discover them. We&#8217;re like a giant shopping mall for people to discover these things,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The app, however, wants to be useful to those who also just want to stay in touch with friends and family. On this front, it&#8217;s rolling out free gifts this week called &#8220;IOUs,&#8221; for telling someone you&#8217;re thinking of them &#8212; for example, by saying something like &#8220;I owe you dinner next time I&#8217;m in town&#8221; or sharing some other more symbolic gift.</p>
<p>The app will also later integrate a calendar that will help you track important occasions, like birthdays and other major life events.</p>
<p>Goody was founded in March 2020 and the app launched in mid-December of the same year. So far, around 10,000 gifts have been sent using its service, Lando says.</p>
<p>In addition to the holiday season, of course, the pandemic may have played a role in Goody&#8217;s early traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the pandemic has been a big problem for everyone. And one of the things that people frankly don&#8217;t talk about enough, in my opinion, is the psychological toll the pandemic is taking on everyone&#8230;we are all creatures that enjoy social interaction. It feels good to see other people &#8212; especially the people you care about. And when you don&#8217;t, it really drains you of energy,&#8221; Lando says.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is obviously not the same as seeing people in person, but I do think that Goody is a nice injection of warmth and positivity&#8230;Everyone who uses it says they feel good after using it, which I think is rare,&#8221; Lando notes.</p>

<p>The startup, meanwhile, has raised a little more than $4 million in early funding from investors including Quiet Capital, Index Ventures, Pareto Holdings, Third Kind Venture Capital, Craft Ventures and the founders of Coinbase (Fred Ehrsam) and Quora (Charlie Cheever), among others.</p>
<p>Goody is a team of nine full-time employees, based in Miami and elsewhere, working remotely. Ahead of Valentine&#8217;s Day, the company snagged a spot on a Times Square billboard to advertise its app, in the hopes of gaining new users during one of the bigger gifting holidays of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late Friday, Oscar Health <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521030955/d28906ds1.htm">filed to go public</a>, adding another company to today&#8217;s burgeoning IPO market. The New York-based health insurance unicorn has raised well north of $1 billion during its life, making its public debut a critical event for a host of investors.</p>
<p>Oscar Health lists a placeholder raise value of $100 million in its IPO filing, providing only directional guidance that its public offering will raise nine figures of capital.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Both Oscar and the high-profile SPAC for Clover Medical will prove to be a test for the venture capital industry&#8217;s faith in their ability to disrupt traditional healthcare companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The eight-year-old company, launched to capitalize on the sweeping health insurance reforms passed under the administration of President Barack Obama offers insurance products to individuals, families and small businesses. The company claimed 529,000 &#8220;members&#8221; as of January 31, 2021. Oscar Health touts that number as indicative of its success, with its growth since January 31 2017 &#8220;representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 59%.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, while Oscar has shown a strong ability to raise private funds and scale the revenues of its neoinsurance business, like many insurance-focused startups that TechCrunch has covered in recent years, it&#8217;s a deeply unprofitable enterprise.</p>
<h2>Inside Oscar Health</h2>
<p>To understand Oscar Health we have to dig a bit into insurance terminology, but it&#8217;ll be as painless as we can manage. So, how did the company perform in 2020? Here are its 2020 metrics, and their 2019 comps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total premiums earned:</strong> $1.67 billion (+61% from $1.04 billion).</li>
<li><strong>Premiums ceded to reinsurers:</strong> $1.22 billion (+113%, from $572.3 million).</li>
<li><strong>Net premium earned:</strong> $455 million (-3% from $468.9 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $462.8 million (-5% from $488.2 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total insurance costs:</strong> $525.9 million (-8.7% from $576.1 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total operating expenses:</strong> $865.1 million (+16% from $747.6 million).</li>
<li><strong>Operating loss:</strong> $402.3 million (+56% from $259.4 million).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the numbers together. Oscar Health did a great job raising its total premium volume in 2020, or, in simpler terms, it sold way more insurance last year than it did in 2019. But it also ceded a lot more premium to reinsurance companies in 2020 than it did in 2019. So what? Ceding premiums is contra-revenue, but can serve to boost overall insurance margins.</p>
<p>As we can see in the net premium earned line, Oscar&#8217;s totals fell in 2020 compared to 2019 thanks to greatly expanded premium ceding. Indeed, its total revenue fell in 2020 compared to 2019 thanks to that effort. But the premium ceding seems to be working for the company, as its total insurance costs (our addition of its claims line item and &#8220;other insurance costs&#8221; category) fell from 2020 to 2019, despite selling far more insurance last year.</p>
<p>Sadly, all that work did not mean that the company&#8217;s total operating expenses fell. They did not, rising 16% or so in 2020 compared to 2019. And as we all know, more operating costs and fewer revenues mean that operating losses rose, and they did.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s net losses track closely to its operating losses, so we spared you more data. Now to better understand the basic economics of Oscar Health&#8217;s insurance business, let&#8217;s get our hands dirty.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">who alleged racial and gender discrimination</a> at the company, is co-leading new legislation with California State Senator Connie Leyva and others to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and/or harassment. Introduced today, the Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination‚Äîwhether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic,&#8221; Leyva said in a statement. &#8220;SB 331 will empower survivors to speak out‚Äîif they so wish‚Äîso they can hold perpetrators accountable and hopefully prevent abusers from continuing to torment and abuse other workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This proposed bill would expand the current protections workers have through the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, also authored by Leyva, that went into effect in 2019. Ozoma, along with former co-worker Aerica Shimizu Banks, came forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination last year. They eventually settled with Pinterest, but the STAND Act technically only protected them for speaking out about gender discrimination. This new bill would ensure workers are also protected when speaking out about racial discrimination.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a legal gamble,&#8221; Ozoma told TechCrunch about coming forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination, despite having signed an NDA. Pinterest could&#8217;ve decided to sue both Ozoma and Banks, Ozoma said, but that would&#8217;ve required the company to admit wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, we weren&#8217;t [supposed to talk about racial discrimination] and that&#8217;s what most companies bank on,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long road ahead for the bill, which needs to be passed by the legislature and ultimately signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom, but it would represent a monumental shift in the tech industry, if passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be huge and not just for tech, but for your industry as well,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I believe that we don&#8217;t have real progress unless we approach things intersectionally and that&#8217;s the lesson from all of us.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This group of companies are what we're calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we're not too strict on that revenue figure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost amongst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">all the IPO chatter</a> of the mega-unicorns are a crop of companies reaching their stride, often flush with capital, ready with big plans, and still with some time before they go public. This group of companies are what we&#8217;re calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we&#8217;re not too strict on that revenue figure.</p>
<p>Close enough will do.</p>
<p>A little bit ago we kicked off the series by looking at ¬†<a href="https://www.ownbackup.com/">OwnBackup</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://www.withassembly.com/">Assembly</a>. Today we&#8217;re continuing the series, digging into <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> and <a href="https://picsart.com/">PicsArt</a>. Next up is and <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack</a>, and we have an interview with <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/">Kaseya</a> on deck. The latter company is a bit oversized for our cohort, but we&#8217;ll figure out what to do with our notes from that chat in due time.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we&#8217;re looking at startups that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">around the $50 million ARR mark</a> because our 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">exploration of $100 million ARR companies</a> wound up merely taking looks at companies, like Lemonade, that were going public in short order. We&#8217;ll still do the occasional piece on the group, but we&#8217;re focusing on smaller firms this year.</p>
<p>So, into the breach with notes on SimpleNexus and PicsArt, drawing on public information concerning their fundraising history and product, and interviews with both companies. Let&#8217;s see what we can learn from their growth!</p>
<h2>SimpleNexus</h2>
<p>SimpleNexus is a Utah-based technology company that provides digital mortgage software. The company most recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simplenexus-secures-108m-to-transform-the-homeownership-journey-into-a-seamlessly-connected-experience-301200675.html">raised $108 million in January of this year</a>, a Series B that we sadly lack a valuation for.</p>
<p>The company is growing quickly, with founders Matt Hansen and Ben Miller telling TechCrunch that they expect to scale from $30 million to $58 million in the next 12 months. That puts the the company comfortably into our new group.</p>
<p>SimpleNexus&#8217;s product is sold to banks and other financial institutions, helping provide a hub &#8212; a simple nexus, if you will &#8212; providing consumers a single login to manage their home-buying process from search to purchase. The software itself is sold on a SaaS basis, often white-labeled to banks.</p>
<p>But while SimpleNexus has seen success with its current model, claiming to touch around one in every eight mortgages, its founders told TechCrunch in a video call that they have bigger aspirations. Hansen, who is also the company&#8217;s CEO, said that in the future its service could stick with customers after they buy a home, perhaps helping them connect utilities, find appraisers, and manage their home.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about the company&#8217;s recent capital raise, and how it may impact SimpleNexus&#8217;s ramp to nearly $60 million in revenue by January 2021. Per the company, it wasn&#8217;t looking for capital, but after receiving some inbound offers to sell its entire business, which weren&#8217;t what its founders wanted, it decided to raise more external capital instead. Insight, which led the round, was excited about their company, the founders said, thanks to its customer growth and revenue expansion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> &#8212; the programming language, not the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">survival game</a> &#8212; now has a new home: the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/">Rust Foundation</a>. AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla banded together to launch this new foundation today and put a two-year commitment to a million-dollar budget behind it. This budget will allow the project to &#8220;develop services, programs, and events that will support the Rust project maintainers in building the best possible Rust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rust started as a side project inside of Mozilla to develop an alternative to C/C++. Designed by Mozilla Research&#8217;s Graydon Hore, with contributions from the likes of JavaScript creator Brendan Eich, Rust became the core language for some of the fundamental features of the Firefox browser and its Gecko engine, as well as Mozilla&#8217;s Servo engine. Today, Rust is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most-loved language</a> among developers. But with Mozilla&#8217;s layoffs in recent months, many on the Rust team lost jobs and the future of the language became unclear without a main sponsor, though the project itself has thousands of contributors and a lot of corporate users, so the language itself wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>A large open-source project often needs some kind of guidance, which the new foundation will provide &#8212; and it takes a legal entity to manage various aspects of the community, including the trademark, for example. The <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/">new Rust board</a> will feature five board directors from the five founding members, as well as five directors from project leadership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúMozilla incubated¬†<span class="il">Rust</span> to build a better Firefox and contribute to a better Internet,&#8221; writes Bobby Holley, Mozilla and¬†<span class="il">Rust</span> Foundation Board member, in a statement. &#8220;In its new home with the <span class="il">Rust </span>Foundation, <span class="il">Rust</span>¬†will have the room to grow into its own success, while continuing to amplify some of the core values that Mozilla shares with the¬†<span class="il">Rust</span>¬†community.‚Äù</p>
<p>All of the corporate sponsors have a vested interest in Rust and are using it to build (and rebuild) core aspects of some of their stacks. Google recently said that it will fund a Rust-based project that aims to make the Apache webserver safer, for example, while Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3605551/microsoft-forms-rust-language-team.html">formed a Rust team</a>, too, and is using the language to rewrite some core Windows APIs. AWS recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-the-general-availability-of-bottlerocket-an-open-source-linux-distribution-purpose-built-to-run-containers/">launched</a> Bottlerocket, a new Linux distribution for containers that, for example, features a build system that was largely written in Rust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank‚Äôs earnings always leads to a bonanza of news. One storyline that has dominated the company‚Äôs earnings over the past few years that has all but disappeared though is WeWork.</p>
<p>The co-working company, which saw its scorching-hot flame dim a few years ago and which has been parlayed into such books as <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/reeves-wiedeman/billion-dollar-loser/9780316461368/">Billion Dollar Loser</a>, is all but invisible in SoftBank‚Äôs presentations these days. The company, despite being one of the largest investments in SoftBank‚Äôs $98.6 billion Vision Fund, is <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/investor-svf_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">not mentioned in the firm‚Äôs quarterly update</a>, and the <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/earnings-presentation_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">company‚Äôs investor presentation also has no mention of the company</a>. (Its logo does appear on the portfolio page, although it is buried with all the other logos.)</p>
<p>Yet, for all the doom that has been emanating from WeWork, from its financial shenanigans to dealing with the workplace in a post-COVID-19 world, results apparently are better than what might be expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Buried in the footnotes of SoftBank‚Äôs earnings report today is some good news related to WeWork. The Japanese telco conglomerate recognized improvements of $1.36 billion in various credit facilities for WeWork compared to its figures in the first three months of 2020.</p>
<p>Given WeWork‚Äôs instability, SoftBank had set aside large sums of capital to cover the rent and mandatory loan payments of WeWork in order to shore up the company‚Äôs financial picture. However, ‚Äúmainly due to the improvement in the credit risk of WeWork‚Äù according to SoftBank, the risk profile of those loans has improved quite a bit, and the company no longer feels the need to offer as much of a financial buffer as it did nine months previous.</p>
<p>Now, that could just be some innovative accounting engineering, but that improvement in WeWork‚Äôs performance mirrors rumors heard in recent weeks that the company is expected to once again attempt to head to the public markets.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306">The Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork was looking to go public via SPAC</a> for a rumored price of $10 billion. No deal has yet been announced, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">while SoftBank is in the process of raising two more SPACs</a> for a grand total of three, it is unlikely to merge WeWork through its own vehicles.</p>

<p>While that $10 billion market cap is far below some of the most bullish prices that WeWork was pumping investors on back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/wework-delays-ipo/">during its roadshow in September 2019</a>, it nonetheless shows that the company may not be the financial albatross it was two years ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash is expanding its robotic footprint into the kitchen. The delivery service is set to acquire Chowbotics, a Bay Area-based robotics best known for its salad-making robot, Sally. TechCrunch has confirmed the acquisition, which was first noted by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-is-buying-robotics-startup-chowbotics-11612805441">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,‚Äù DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in a comment offered to TechCrunch. &#8220;At DoorDash, we are always working to innovate and continue improving how we support our merchant partners and their success &#8212; and are excited to leverage this technology to do so in new ways. With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Chowbotics has raised around $21 million to date, including an $11 million round back in 2018. The company‚Äôs vending machine-style salad bar robot was already well-positioned for the pandemic, removing a human element from the food preparation process &#8212; not to mention the fact that salad bars and buffets tend to be open air affairs. In October, the startup added a contactless feature to the robot, letting users order ahead of time, via app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúJoining the DoorDash team unlocks new possibilities for Chowbotics and the technology that this team has built over the past seven years,‚Äù CEO Rick Wilmer said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs the leader in food delivery and on-demand logistics, DoorDash has the unparalleled reach and expertise to help us grow and deploy our technology more broadly, so together, we can make fresh, nutritious food easy for more people.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not entirely clear how the company‚Äôs technology will fit into the delivery service‚Äôs current offering, though DoorDash notes it will ‚Äúimprove consumer access to fresh and safe meals, and enhance our robust merchant offerings and logistics platform.‚Äù It also remains to be seen whether Chowbotics will continue to operate as its own entity within the broader DoorDash. We‚Äôve reached out for more insight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt DoorDash, we strive to become a merchant‚Äôs first call when they want to grow their business,‚Äù Tang said. ‚ÄúWhat excites us most about Chowbotics is that the team has developed a remarkable tool for helping merchants grow. Bringing Chowbotics‚Äô technology into the DoorDash platform gives us a new opportunity to help merchants expand their current menu offerings and reach new customers in new markets &#8212; which is a fundamental part of our merchant-first approach to empowering local economies.‚Äù</p>
<p>DoorDash has been working with robotics companies for a number of years now. Perhaps the most prominent example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/18/postmates-and-doordash-are-testing-delivery-by-robot-with-starship-technologies/">is a partnership with Starship Technologies</a> to explore food delivery robots. Though that technology has seen a fair number of roadblocks among local officials not eager to turn their sidewalks over to robots. The delivery company likens Chowbotics‚Äô kiosk-style technology to its work with ghost kitchens, effectively serving as a conduit to help expand food options at local merchants ‚Äì be it in store or through delivery. The former will likely be of more interest once the current pandemic is in the rear view.</p>
<p>Details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is there so much M&#038;A action in the container security space now?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, another container security startup came off the board when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/rapid7-acquires-kubernetes-security-startup-alcide-for-50m/">Rapid7 bought Alcide</a> for $50 million. The purchase is part of a broader trend in which larger companies are buying up cloud-native security startups at a rapid clip. But why is there so much M&amp;A action in this space now?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">Palo Alto Networks was first</a> to the punch, grabbing Twistlock for $410 million in May 2019. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">VMware struck a year later</a>, snaring Octarine. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/">Cisco followed with PortShift</a> in October and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/">Red Hat snagged StackRox</a> last month before the Rapid7 response last week.</p>
<p>This is partly because many companies chose to become cloud-native more quickly during the pandemic. This has created a sharper focus on security, but it would be a mistake to attribute the acquisition wave strictly to COVID-19, as companies were shifting in this direction pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that security startups that cover a niche like container security often reach market saturation faster than companies with broader coverage because customers often want to consolidate on a single platform, rather than dealing with a fragmented set of vendors and figuring out how to make them all work together.</p>
<p>Containers provide a way to deliver software by breaking down a large application into discrete pieces known as microservices. These are packaged and delivered in containers. Kubernetes provides the orchestration layer, determining when to deliver the container and when to shut it down.</p>
<p>This level of automation presents a security challenge, making sure the containers are configured correctly and not vulnerable to hackers. With myriad switches this isn&#8217;t easy, and it&#8217;s made even more challenging by the ephemeral nature of the containers themselves.</p>

The company has now seen 18 investments exit, including 10 fully exited and eight that are now trading on the public markets.</p>

<p>Yet, tucked away deeply in the company‚Äôs earnings statement was a note that the company has cut in half the performance incentive earmarked for the Vision Fund‚Äôs leadership, from $5 billion to $2.5 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That $5 billion incentive scheme was controversial when news of it was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec8628a8-73ef-11e8-b6ad-3823e4384287">first reported by publications like Financial Times</a> back in April 2018. In the model, SoftBank essentially loaned its employees money to buy into the Vision Fund, a structure that was designed to accelerate the closing of the fund‚Äôs $100 billion fundraise. The company first added language about the incentive scheme in its 2018 Q2 earnings, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>On October 19, 2018, SoftBank Vision Fund completed an interim closing with additional committed capital of $5 billion. This brought the total committed capital of the Fund to $96.7 billion. The additional committed capital is intended for the installment of an incentive scheme for operations of SoftBank Vision Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the company has had consistent language about the $5 billion figure in every quarterly earnings report. However, in today‚Äôs latest earnings for fiscal 2020 Q3, the company noted that the incentives are now ‚Äú$2.5 billion (decreased from the previous $5.0 billion).‚Äù</p>
<p>The incentive scheme for SoftBank has been a huge point of discussion for industry observers. Four top executives at SoftBank ‚Äî Rajeev Misra, Marcelo Claure, Katsunori Sago and Ken Miyauchi have collectively been loaned $600 million to buy into the Vision Fund, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/54b67d4c-fb3c-489c-ac58-418f0f5c739f">according to a report two weeks ago in Financial Times</a>. Some of that money was derived from the $5 billion (now $2.5 billion) incentive scheme, although it isn‚Äôt clear if all that money was earmarked exclusively from this particular pool.</p>
<p>SoftBank‚Äôs pullback on incentives for the Vision Fund is seemingly a response to the fund‚Äôs overall lackluster performance and the fund‚Äôs disastrous investment in WeWork, which led to wide losses at the telecom group. While more recent performance has been much better for the fund, eliminating some of those incentives should improve overall performance of the fund and ultimately SoftBank‚Äôs bottom line.</p>
<p>Vision Fund I has stopped investing in new companies as of last year. A second fund has $10 billion in capital ‚Äî all from SoftBank itself ‚Äî and has been making regular investments. The Vision Fund has also been raising SPACs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">including two new ones it announced late last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The French government and the government-backed initiative La French Tech <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/fr/la-france-aide-les-startups/french-tech-120-2/">unveiled</a> the new indexes that identify the most promising French startups. The 40 top-performing startups are called the Next40, and the top 120 startups are grouped into the French Tech 120.</p>
<p>The Next40 and French Tech 120 are somewhat new as this is only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">the second version</a> of those indexes. Out of the 120 startups that were in last year‚Äôs French Tech 120, 90 of them are still in this year‚Äôs index ‚Äî 30 are newcomers as there were 123 startups in last year‚Äôs French Tech 120.</p>
<p>Combined, they generate close to ‚Ç¨9 billion in revenue and provide a job to 37,500 people. Revenue in particular is up 55% compared to last year‚Äôs French Tech 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here‚Äôs a list of the French Tech 120 ‚Äî the red logos are part of the Next40:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110214" style="width: 948px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110214" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png" alt="" width="938" height="626" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> La French Tech</p></div></p>
<p>There are two ways to get accepted in the Next40:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have raised more than ‚Ç¨100 million over the past three years ($120 million at today‚Äôs rate) or you are a unicorn, which means your company‚Äôs valuation has reached $1 billion or more.</li>
<li>You generate more than ‚Ç¨5 million in revenue with a year-over-year growth rate of 30% or more for the past three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the remaining 80 startups in the French Tech 120:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 of them have raised more than ‚Ç¨20 million in a funding round over the past three years.</li>
<li>40 of them are selected based on the annual turnover and growth rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, those indexes are limited to private French companies. For the French Tech 120, there are at least two startups per administrative region.</p>
<p>Based on those metrics, only a handful of the startups in the French Tech 120 have a female CEO and the French government thinks tech startups should do more when it comes to diversity and inclusion. That‚Äôs why a small group of people are going to work on a roadmap and some recommendations to improve those numbers.</p>
<p>Representatives of six different startups in the French Tech 120, as well as people from <a href="https://www.wearesista.com">Sista</a>, <a href="http://www.techyourplace.fr">Tech Your Place</a> and <a href="https://www.futurepositivecapital.com">Future Positive Capital</a>, will get together to work on those topics.</p>
<p>In addition to a cool logo for your website, being part of the French Tech 120 comes with some perks. Those companies can access a network of French Tech representatives in different public administrations.</p>
<p>For instance, it‚Äôs easier for your company if you want to get visas for foreign employees, obtain a certification or a patent, if you want to sell your product to a public administration, etc.</p>
<p>There are two new additions to the French Tech network. Someone from the <em>Conseil d‚Äô√âtat</em> can help you when it comes to legal compliance. The government has also signed a partnership with Euronext to educate entrepreneurs about going public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank had some good data to report overnight <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">with its third-quarter earnings</a>, which covers the last quarter of 2020 through December 31. The company‚Äôs first Vision Fund reported large gains driven by DoorDash, where the company‚Äôs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/">$680 million investment blew up to just shy of $9 billion</a> ‚Äî a 13.2x return in SoftBank‚Äôs math. While not the first exit from the fund nor the first high-returning exit SoftBank has had, it <i>is</i> the first exit that meaningfully shakes up the prognosis for the Vision Fund‚Äôs returns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cWwsjHqN3U"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/">The VC and founder winners of DoorDash‚Äôs IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VC and founder winners of DoorDash‚Äôs IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/embed/#?secret=cWwsjHqN3U" data-secret="cWwsjHqN3U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now seems as good a time as any to ask a question we first started pondering when SoftBank launched the Vision Fund way back in 2017: What does a return profile look like at such a late stage of investment?</p>
<p>Early-stage venture capital has a return profile dubbed the ‚ÄúJ-curve.‚Äù Given a cohort of startups in a venture portfolio, the failures of that cohort tend to materialize quite quickly. Those startups can‚Äôt raise money, and thus, they run out of runway and either die or are sold off. That means that the losses from those investments are recognized by investors right away. Meanwhile, the successful startups keep growing and raising venture capital, but funds won‚Äôt realize their gains for potentially a decade or more. Thus, the J-curve describes the early years of a fund where the losses are visible but the future gains have not yet materialized.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2110212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=680,583 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=1536,1317 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=2048,1755 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The Vision Fund pioneered a much more muscular form of traditional mezzanine (pre-IPO) capital, where it would barge into a company‚Äôs cap table with big dollars and high valuations with the dream that these companies would go big. While not true of all of the Vision Fund‚Äôs investments, many of these startups were quite mature with serious revenues where the alternative to mezzanine capital was an IPO.</p>
<p>That brought up an interesting fund construction question: The sort of immediate failures that create the J-curve for early-stage investors shouldn‚Äôt presumably exist at later stages, where startups are less-risky investments. Sure, some startups may grow more slowly than other companies and exit for a middling return, but few startups should actually fail entirely.</p>
<p>So what does the SoftBank data look like today and what can it tell us about late-stage fund performance?</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund I made a total of 92 investments from summer of 2017 to mid-2020, of which 10 have fully exited, and eight are now traded on the public markets. According to SoftBank, 25 of its Fund I portfolio companies received another venture capital round in calendar year 2020 as well, giving the firm some upticks in its fair-market valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inevent.com">InEvent</a>, a startup powering virtual and hybrid events, is announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding from Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a tiny fraction of the $125 million that online events platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">Hopin raised last fall</a> ‚Äî in fact,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/"> a recent Equity episode</a> suggested that Hopin might be the fastest growth story of the current startup era.</p>
<p>CEO Pedro G√≥es told me that even in a world of more established and better-funded platforms, his team sees an opportunity to break out by focusing on business-to-business events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an opening in the space for us to be the leader that we want on B2B,&#8221; G√≥es said. &#8220;We don‚Äôt intend to compete with platforms in the B2C market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put another way, InEvent is less focused on replicating giant consumer events and more on helping businesses hold virtual events where they can connect with clients and partners. G√≥es said this is something that he and his co-founders Mauricio Giordano and Vinicius Neris saw in their previous work running a digital agency, where they were often asked to help with events in this vein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we had a lot of experience with events, we could see where the industry was broken and how to fix it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110193" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110193" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110193" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?w=680" alt="InEvent screenshot" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110193" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> InEvent</p></div></p>
<p>G√≥es suggested that two of the big needs for B2B events are customization and support, so InEvent has created what he described as a &#8220;really beautiful&#8221; product that can still be customized with the organizer&#8217;s branding, and the company also offers 24-hour support.</p>
<p>The platform is a virtual lobby where participants can browse all the programming, a video player, a registration system, the ability to create a conference mobile app and more. G√≥es said the goal was to build something that was &#8220;really flexible,&#8221; allowing organizers to run everything from within InEvent while also allowing them to incorporate outside tools, whether that&#8217;s video platforms like Zoom or CRM software like Salesforce, Marketo and HubSpot.</p>
<p>InEvent&#8217;s founders are from Brazil, but the startup is headquartered in Atlanta and has employees in 13 countries. It says it&#8217;s been used by more than 500 customers for global events, including DowDupont, Coca-Cola and Santander.</p>
<p>With the new funding, G√≥es told me the startup will be able to expand the team (he was proud to note the team&#8217;s diversity ‚Äî 50% of its managers are women, and 50% of its managers come from a Latinx background). It also will continue to develop the product, for example by improving the video player and adding more marketing automation.</p>
<p>And when the pandemic ends and large-scale, in-person conferences become possible again, G√≥es predicts there will still be plenty of appetite for what InEvent can do, because more events will bring online and in-person elements together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have different clients where we have a website, we have a mobile app, but we also have hardware [to] connect with in-person,&#8221; he said. After all, if you&#8217;re at a sprawling conference like CES, it might still be convenient to chat with another attendee through the mobile app, rather than traveling two miles to see them face-to-face. &#8220;For us, what we are building, the technology for virtual and in-person, is the same thing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is continuing to explore the addition of subscription services and other paid features to supplement its advertising revenues, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content">Bloomberg</a> this morning. The company is considering a range of ideas, the report said, including tipping, paid consumer-facing features like profile customizations or an &#8220;undo send&#8221; option, or subscription-based access to Twitter&#8217;s Tweetdeck app. Twitter confirmed the company is researching and experimenting with new models, but declined to provide details.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s interest in paid features, including subscriptions, was already public knowledge.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/">last summer ran a survey</a> that asked users which options they were willing to pay for &#8212; including things like custom colors, the ability to publish longer and more high-def videos, profile badges, auto responses, an &#8220;undo send&#8221; (an alternative to the &#8220;edit&#8221; button users actually want) and, for brands, things like the ability to run brand surveys and added &#8220;social listening&#8221; analytics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, during its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/twitter-q2-misses-on-sales-of-683m-loss-per-share-of-0-16-as-covid-19-takes-its-toll/">Q2 2020</a> earnings, Twitter CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/">Jack Dorsey told investors</a> it‚Äôll likely run subscription tests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uDo7H3rapA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/">After ad revenue drop, Twitter tells investors it&#8217;s eyeing subscription options</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After ad revenue drop, Twitter tells investors it&#8217;s eyeing subscription options&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/embed/#?secret=uDo7H3rapA" data-secret="uDo7H3rapA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We do think there is a world where subscription is complementary. We think there is a world where commerce is complementary,&#8221; Dorsey said at the time. &#8220;You can imagine work around helping people manage paywalls, as well, that we believe is complementary. So that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options, obviously we‚Äôre hiring for those teams,&#8221; he had noted.</p>
<p>And last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing">a Twitter job posting was spotted</a> that referenced a team &#8220;building a subscription platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal during its Q3 2020 earnings confirmed those plans, noting &#8220;you will see tests from us&#8221; on the subscription front. But he also warned these wouldn&#8217;t be things that impacted Twitter revenue in the near-term.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s report added just a couple of new details to our earlier understanding of these efforts. It noted that one of the research projects around subscriptions was code-named &#8220;Rogue One,&#8221; and another involved the idea of &#8220;tipping&#8221; for exclusive content.</p>
<p>This latter item could perhaps reference an idea of how Twitter could monetize its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">recent acquisition</a> of newsletter platform Revue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">now rolled out</a> on the web. That is, users could possibly &#8220;tip&#8221; (pay) to read someone&#8217;s newsletter. But Twitter could also be considering a tipping feature inside Twitter&#8217;s audio-based networking feature and Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>. Or it could be something else &#8212; <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-twitter">The Information</a> had also previously reported a tipping feature was being looked into, last month, but Twitter told them nothing was yet in development.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VohoGyfxNP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">Twitter quietly rolls out Revue newsletters shortcut on web</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter quietly rolls out Revue newsletters shortcut on web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/embed/#?secret=VohoGyfxNP" data-secret="VohoGyfxNP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter today declined to offer any further clarifications about its plans on this front.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the company confirmed it was still considering new monetization models in order to grow its revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasing revenue durability is our top company objective. You will see us continue to research and experiment with ways to further diversify our revenue beyond ads in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; said Bruce Falck, Revenue Product Lead, in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;These may include subscriptions and other approaches that will give people and businesses of all sizes on Twitter access to unique features and enhanced opportunities for content creation, discovery, and engagement. While we&#8217;re excited about this potential, it‚Äôs important to note we are still in very early exploration and we do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021. Given the massive opportunity to build upon our strengths, our main focus continues to be on growing our ads business,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Twitter in Q3 2020 had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/twitter-revenue-rises-14-but-user-growth-fails-to-impress/">beat analyst expectations</a> on revenue and net income, but investors are still stuck on Twitter&#8217;s inability to substantially grow its user base. The company reports its Q4 2020 earnings on Tuesday, where its plans for new revenue models may again be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Additive manufacturing has proven an ideal solution for certain tasks, but the technology still lacks more traditional methods in a number of categories. One of the biggest is the requirement for post-printing assembly. 3D printers can create extremely complex components, but an outside party (be it human or machine) is required to put them together.</p>
<p>MIT‚Äôs CSAIL department this week <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/fabricating-fully-functional-drones-0208">showcased ‚ÄúLaserFactory,‚Äù</a> a new project that attempts to develop robotics, drones and other machines than can be fabricated as part of a ‚Äúone-stop shop.‚Äù The system is comprised of a software kit and hardware platform designed to create structures and assemble circuitry and sensors for the machine.</p>
<p>A more fully realized version of the project will be showcased at an event in May, but the team is pulling back the curtain a bit to show what the concept looks like in practice. Here‚Äôs a breakdown from CSAIL‚Äôs page:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Let‚Äôs say a user has aspirations to create their own drone. They‚Äôd first design their device by placing components on it from a parts library, and then draw on circuit traces, which are the copper or aluminum lines on a printed circuit board that allow electricity to flow between electronic components. They‚Äôd then finalize the drone‚Äôs geometry in the 2D editor. In this case, they‚Äôd use propellers and batteries on the canvas, wire them up to make electrical connections, and draw the perimeter to define the quadcopter‚Äôs shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Printing circuit boards is certainly nothing new. What sets CSAIL‚Äôs machine apart here is the breadth of functionality that‚Äôs been jammed into the machine here. An accompanying video lays it out pretty well:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzCAqVwZYCc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, this is early days &#8212; we‚Äôre still months out from the official presentation. There are a lot of questions, and more to the point, a lot of potential points of failure for a complex machine like this &#8212; especially one that seems to have non-experts as a target audience.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaking fabrication inexpensive, fast, and accessible to a layman remains a challenge,‚Äù PhD student and lead author Martin Nisser says in the release. ‚ÄúBy leveraging widely available manufacturing platforms like 3D printers and laser cutters, LaserFactory is the first system that integrates these capabilities and automates the full pipeline for making functional devices in one system.‚Äù</p>
<p>The software appears to be a big piece of the puzzle &#8212; allowing users to view a version of the product before it‚Äôs printed. By then, of course, it‚Äôs too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.felicis.com/team/aydin/">Aydin Senkut</a> is a Swiss Army knife of an investor. He has been on the Midas List for the past seven years, with early investments in companies like Shopify, Rovio, Fitbit, Ayden, Credit Karma, SoundHound and more.</p>
<p>One such investment is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/guideline/">Guideline</a>, an enterprise tech company focused on giving small businesses a simplified way to offer affordable 401ks to employees. Guideline has raised nearly $140 million from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Greyhound, Generation Investment Management, Propel and, of course, Felicis.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Senkut and Guideline <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinbusque/">founder and CEO Kevin Busque</a> join us for this week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">new and improved Extra Crunch Live</a> pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we‚Äôll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, Guideline founder and CEO Kevin Busque and Felicis&#8217; Aydin Senkut) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven‚Äôt yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30 a.m. PST/2:30 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>In this case, we&#8217;ll be talking to Senkut and Busque about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/guideline-15-million/">$15 million Series B investment</a> that Felicis led in the startup: How did they meet, what attracted them to one another, and ultimately, what made them decide to be financially bound together for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For now, let&#8217;s learn a bit more about Senkut and Busque, shall we?</p>
<p>Before starting Felicis Ventures (and serving as managing partner), Senkut was a senior manager at Google responsible for strategic partner development and account management in Asia Pacific. He joined the search giant in 1999 as its first product manager to launch Google&#8217;s first international sites. He then became the company&#8217;s first international sales manager.</p>
<p>Alongside an impressive portfolio of both angel and institutional investments, Senkut is about as well-rounded as a tech leader can be.</p>
<p>Kevin Busque, meanwhile, founded <a href="https://www.guideline.com/">Guideline</a> in 2015 and has since amassed more than 17,500 small businesses on the platform with nearly $4 billion in assets under management. Before Guideline, Busque spent seven years at TaskRabbit where he was a co-founder and VP of Technology. Busque deeply understands what it takes to go from idea to MVP to product market fit to hypergrowth.</p>
<p>This episode of Extra Crunch Live airs at 3 p.m. EST/12 p.m. PST on Wednesday, February 10.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=felicisguideline">Extra Crunch members only</a>. We‚Äôre coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on demand if you can‚Äôt join us live.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethena co-founders Roxanne Petraeus and Anne Solmssen began their company with a clear goal: There needs to be a more modern, and effective, way to deploy anti-harassment training to employees. Ethena‚Äôs solution is to send employees bite-sized monthly ‚Äúnudges‚Äù or pings with five-minute lessons, replacing the usual one-hour annual workshop with more flexible learning.</p>
<p>The startup raised $2 million off of that vision in June, and today has announced it has raised follow-on funding with the same exact amount, led by GSV. The startup currently has $5 million in venture capital, with investors including Homebrew, Neo and Village Global.</p>
<p>The follow-on capital comes right after Ethena has had some solid growth itself. The startup closed a couple major contracts with companies including Netflix, Zoom and Zendesk, and tells TechCrunch that more than 20,000 active employees complete its monthly training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solid growth and new cash is where the story could stop for now, but Petraeus tells TechCrunch that early momentum has also inspired a shift of sorts in what Ethena is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we initially launched in Feb 2020, we thought that for our first year, we‚Äôd focus entirely on scaling companies because only startups would be interested in an innovative approach to compliance training,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs changed is we‚Äôve learned that even large enterprises want a better approach, deeper impact and are willing to be innovative in a space historically dominated by lawyers and legacy e-learning providers.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/">Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/embed/#?secret=v20qYVlzAA" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is expanding its offering from anti-sexual harassment training to a wide variety of training courses focused on compliance, from financial compliance to code of conduct measures. The shift wasn‚Äôt because of a lack of interest from customers, the co-founder said, but instead demand from existing enterprise customers to offer more than just a singular topic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe think taking a specific sector-based approach can actually narrow the impact we‚Äôre having,‚Äù Petraeus said. ‚ÄúSo we are trying to take a really inclusive approach,‚Äù from the start on what kind of topics should be treated as more than ‚Äújust checking off a box.‚Äù</p>
<p>Petraeus, an army veteran, says that Ethena‚Äôs confidence in effectiveness and outcomes comes from military data on how adults learn.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe know that traditional training just isn&#8217;t effective at behavior change, and there are some studies that show that it&#8217;s a pretty big backlash with increased unconscious bias after training versus before.‚Äù The startup differentiates from other micro-learning plays in its curriculum.</p>
<p>The curriculum is designed to be consumed over the course of a year instead of in an annual hour-long session. This tiny iteration is enough to give employees a repetitive way to understand the content. ‚ÄúWe&#8217;re experimenting with things like graphic novels and podcasts to present training,‚Äù Petraeus said. ‚ÄúJust making sure whatever we‚Äôre doing yesterday is important tomorrow, because I think it‚Äôs important for us to be agile content creators.‚Äù</p>

<p>But Ethena‚Äôs biggest differentiation, Petraeus says, is its content. The pandemic has boasted a whole new sort of situation that employees need help, or proactive guidance, navigating. Petraeus says that Ethena‚Äôs monthly cadence gives it flexibility to adopt ‚Äúmodern‚Äù scenarios like Slack culture and Zoom etiquette. Ethena‚Äôs top performing training nudges in 2020 included lessons on online harassment prevention and mental health inclusivity.</p>
<p>The micro-learning approach has long been popular among edtech companies as a way to sneak or gamify small lessons into a workflow. So far, Ethena says over 90% of 150,000 in-app learner feedback notes are positive, saying the information is engaging and relevant. In Q4, Ethena saw learner growth of more than 250% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>GSV&#8217;s Deborah Quazzo, who led Ethena&#8217;s seed and now this follow-on financing, said that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a coincidence that they&#8217;ve picked up some of the best logos in the world at an early stage,&#8221; referring to Ethena&#8217;s big customers. Quazzo thinks the compliance market has had very limited innovation so far, even though it&#8217;s a massive opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are seeing such strong product market fit and customers are pulling them into areas of content extension, so having more room to run faster made total sense,&#8221; she said.</p>
