										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, your mobile Netflix-watching is about to get a bit more immersive. Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix confirmed</a> that it has begun rolling out spatial audio support on iPhone and iPad on iOS 14 after the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/">spotted</a> by a Reddit user.</p>
<p>Netflix joins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html">streaming competitors</a> like HBO Max, Disney+, and Peacock in enabling this feature, while other popular apps like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube still don&#8217;t have this functionality. Still, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix said</a> the rollout won&#8217;t be immediate — users who have the update should be able to toggle it on or off in the Control Center.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple has been emphasizing its spatial audio features. The company first announced that it would bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-bringing-spatial-audio-to-airpods-pro/">spatial audio to AirPods Pro</a> during the WWDC conference in 2020 — during this year&#8217;s conference, Apple added that Apple Music subscribers would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">gain access</a> to spatial audio and lossless audio streaming at no extra charge. This even supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775">dynamic head tracking</a>, which adjusts the sound when you move your head.  The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android version</a> of the Apple Music app also supports spatial and lossless audio. In February, Spotify said it would rollout a high-end subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify HiFi</a>, which would enable lossless audio, though there&#8217;s been no news since.</p>
<p>Last month, Netflix revealed that it start looking toward mobile gaming in addition to its original movies and television series. The company has already experimented with interactive entertainment with projects like <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">Stranger Things games</a>.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,” the company said in its <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">quarterly earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is popular among video game players — so while this update will enhance the streaming video experience on iPhone and iPad, perhaps we&#8217;ll see this feature at play in eventual Netflix mobile games, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eaze <a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/eaze-to-acquire-multi-state-retail-leader-green-dragon">this week announced </a> significant plans to expand into one the U.S.&#8217;s largest cannabis delivery services. One of the original on-demand cannabis delivery services, the Bay Area-based company is set to acquire cannabis retailer and cultivator Green Dragon, which operates in the hot markets of Colorado and Florida. Combined with existing operations in California and Michigan, the deal would find Eaze operating in America’s four largest cannabis markets.</p>
<p>Less than two years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/eaze-out-of-cash-to-burn/">it was unclear if Eaze would have enough cash to continue operating</a>. According to TechCrunch’s reporting, it was experiencing significant trouble raising funds and went through unannounced layoffs. The company was switching from providing delivery services to operating as a delivery dispensary. Eaze was effectively the Uber of Weed, attempting to become the Amazon of Weed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Keith McCarty, Eaze has raised over $255 million to date. The company cycled through leadership and has seen three CEOs, with Rogelio Choy leading it since 2019. Former CEO <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sf-culture/article/eaze-sf-cannabis-delivery-ceo-bank-fraud-15973138.php">Jim Patterson recently pleaded guilty in a $100 million</a> scheme to deceive banks into processing credit and debit payments in cannabis purchases. The case is similar to one<a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/u-s-district-court-dismisses-tcpa-lawsuit-against-eaze"> brought against Eaze in 2019</a>, though the company denied involvement and is not a defendant in the case against Patterson. The future was unclear, but now two years later, it&#8217;s raising more funds and is on track to become the nation’s largest multi-state cannabis delivery service.</p>
<p>The company switched gears in 2019 and closed a previously-announced Series D financing round of $90 million in August 2020. This year, Eaze is trying to close a $75 million Series E with 80% of the funds already committed. The company expects this round to close in November. Eaze tells TechCrunch that this round will value Eaze at more than $700 million — double its fundraising valuation in 2019. The anticipated funding will be used to drive additional retail expansion.</p>
<p>Eaze Chief Strategy Officer Cory Azzalino justifies the higher valuation as such, “The company is fundamentally different. Even our California operations are significantly larger than they were back in 2019 from a revenue standpoint. But also just in terms of future growth opportunities. There’s a substantial increase in our addressable market. Florida, Michigan and Colorado create some $6 billion worth of incremental market size.”</p>
<p>Eaze is quickly becoming a major national cannabis operator. Earlier in 2021, it announced that its delivery service will be moving into Michigan, the hottest cannabis market in the midwest. If the Green Dragon purchase closes, the company also gains delivery operations in Colorado (now approving cannabis delivery companies) and Florida (a state with a massive medical marijuana market). According to a press release, Green Dragon saw more than one million transactions in 2020, and its Colorado stores grew 39% in 2020. In July, the company turned to Florida, announcing the opening of its first two dispensaries in the state and its intention to secure 20 more locations by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The timing couldn’t be better for Eaze. In June 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple changed an App Story policy</a>, allowing licensed cannabis dispensaries to list and sell cannabis products (flower, edibles, and vapes) directly from an iOS app. Eaze jumped, becoming the first retailer to sell weed from an iPhone app. However, purchases are only possible in Eaze’s two markets: California and (soon) Michigan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Eaze has achieved exponential growth over the last two years by successfully shifting to vertical operations and continuing to grow our loyal customer base,” said Eaze CEO Rogelio Choy said in a released statement. “Green Dragon’s airtight operations in Colorado and expansion into Florida’s booming market adds key operational capabilities to our national footprint and cements our leadership as California’s largest MSO. Together, we are well-positioned to leverage the market’s explosive growth now and into the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok’s plans to collect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/biometrics/">biometric</a> identifiers from its users has prompted concern among U.S. lawmakers, who are demanding the company reveal exactly what information it collects and what it plans to do with that data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045829-klobuchar-letter-to-tiktok">a letter sent earlier this month addressed to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a>, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune, (R-SD) say they are &#8220;alarmed&#8221; by the recent change to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a>’s privacy policy, which allows the company to “automatically collect biometric data, including certain physical and behavioral characteristics from video content posted by its users.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">first reported details of the new privacy policy back in June</a>, when TikTok said it will seek “required permissions” to collect “faceprints and voiceprints&#8221; where required by law, but failed to elaborate on whether it’s considering federal law, states laws, or both (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data">only a handful of U.S. states</a> have biometric privacy laws, including Illinois, Washington, California, Texas and New York).</p>
<p>Klobuchar and Thune’s letter asks TikTok to explicitly explain what constitutes a “faceprint” and “voiceprint”, as well as to explain how this data will be used and how long it will be retained. The senators also quizzed TikTok on whether any data is gathered for users under the age of 18; whether it makes any inferences about its users based on the biometric data it collects; and to provide a list of all third parties that have access to the data.</p>
<p>“The coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in online activity, which has magnified the need to protect consumers’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a>,” the letter reads. “This is especially true for children and teenagers, who comprise more than 32% of TikTok’s active users and have relied on online applications such as TikTok for entertainment and for interaction with their friends and loved ones.”</p>
<p>TikTok has been given until August 25 to respond to the lawmakers’ questions. A TikTok spokesperson did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time TikTok’s excessive data collection plans have come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the company paid out $92 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claiming it unlawfully collected users’ biometric data and shared it with third parties. This came after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">the FTC in 2019 slapped TikTok with a $5.7 million fine </a>for violating the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires apps to receive parental permission before collecting a minor&#8217;s data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every country has its own bundle of laws, rules and regulations, and they change on a regular basis making it an enormous challenge to keep up with it all. That usually requires large staffs filling in spreadsheets and unwieldy processes, but <a href="https://www.regology.com/">Regology</a>, an early stage startup wants to change that by putting some automation to work on the problem.</p>
<p>Today the company announced an $8 million Series A led by Acme Capital with participation from existing investors Gagarin Capital and Pine Wave Investments.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Mukund Goenka spent more than 15 years working in the banking industry where he saw first-hand the difficulties in keeping up with regulations and the financial consequences of failing to do so. He formed Regology to provide large global companies with a way to stay on top of these myriad regulations.</p>
<p>Goenka says that his company started by compiling a database of laws. &#8220;We have a very large database of laws that is constantly updated, covering geographies from five continents, and a number of countries and jurisdictions. We also cover the lawmaking process of going from bills all the way to laws to regulations and a number of agencies and their regular updates on a daily basis. And it covers a number of industries and topic areas as well,&#8221; Goenka explained.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t stop there though. They also give customers a framework for automating compliance wherever they are doing business, and they constantly review the laws and updates to help sure their customers are staying in compliance over time. Their target market is large Fortune 500. companies, and while Goenka couldn&#8217;t name specific ones, he did say that it included some of the largest tech companies and biggest banks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched in 2017 and today has 20 full time employees with plans to at least double that by the end of the year. He says that being diverse is essential in a business that is already looking at the regulatory environment in 25 countries. Understanding how each of these countries works is essential to the business and that requires a diverse workforce to pull off.</p>
<p>Goenka says that the company has been remote from day one, long before COVID. While there is still a small office in Palo Alto, he intends to keep remain mostly remote, even when it&#8217;s considered safe to reopen offices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based Diamond Age this week announced that it has raised $8 million. The seed round is led by Prime Movers Lab and Alpaca VC and features a slew of additional firms, including Dolby Family Ventures, Calm Ventures, Gaingels, Towerview Ventures, GFA Venture Partners and Suffolk Construction.</p>
<p>The startup looks to put a slew of key emerging technologies to work in service of building houses with fewer workers in a significantly truncated time frame. Diamond Age claims that when, fully realized, its tech will be able to reduce manual human labor by 55% and shrink the construction time on a single family home from nine months to 30 days. Part of this funding will go toward putting the processes in place to construct a 1,100-square-foot “demonstration house” as proof of concept.</p>
<p>“We need to build high-quality affordable single-family homes for the next generation striving for the American dream,” co-founder and CEO Jack Oslan said in a release, “and the only way we can solve this problem is with automation.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the company relies on robotic and 3D printing solutions. The former involves a set of 26 different robotic arm attachments to assist with the construction. That tech is coupled with a gantry-based 3D printing technology designed to construct interior and exterior walls for the structure.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company is looking to target the housing crunch in its Bay Area backyard. The systems will be available to construction companies through a RaaS (robotics as a service) rental model. Pricing specifics for the system have not been revealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://uipath.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UIPath</a> came seemingly out of nowhere in the last several years, going public last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">in a successful IPO</a> during which it raised over $527 million. It raised $2 billion in private money prior to that with its final private valuation coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">at an amazing $35 billion</a>. UIPath CEO Daniel Dines will be joining us on a panel on automation at TC Sessions: Saas on October 27th.</p>
<p>The company has been able capture all this investor attention doing something called Robotic Process Automation, which provides a way to automate a series of highly mundane tasks. It has become quite popular, especially to help bring a level of automation to legacy systems that might not be able to handle more modern approaches to automation involving artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">Gartner found that RPA</a> was the fastest growing category in enterprise software.</p>
<p>In point of fact,  UIPath didn&#8217;t actually come out of nowhere. It was founded in 2005 as a consulting company and transitioned to software over the years. The company took its first VC funding, a modest $1.5 million seed round in 2015, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>As RPA found its market, the startup began to take off, raising gobs of money including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/">a $568 million round in April 2019</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">$750 million in its final private raise</a> in February 2021.</p>
<p>Dines will be appearing on a panel discussing the role of automation in the enterprise. Certainly, the pandemic drove home the need for increased automation as masses of office workers moved to work from home, a trend that is likely to continue even after the pandemic slows.</p>
<p>As the RPA market leader, he is uniquely positioned to discuss how this software and other similar types will evolve in the coming years and how it could combine with related trends like no-code and process mapping. Dines will be joined on the panel by investor Laela Sturdy from Capital G and ServiceNow&#8217;s Dave Wright where they will discuss the state of the automation market, why it&#8217;s so hot and where the next opportunities could be.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Dines, the conference will also include Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi, Salesforce&#8217;s Kathy Baxter and Puppet’s Abby Kearns, as well as investors Casey Aylward and Sarah Guo, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a stimulating day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors and AT&amp;T will be rolling out 5G connectivity in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads, and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>Executives said in a media briefing that the rollout of the 5G architecture will also bring benefits for GM models that are 4G LTE-equipped, such as those from model year 2019 and newer. Once available, vehicle owners of select models “will easily migrate to the new network infrastructure once available,” the companies said in a news release.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s going to be a performance boost and improvements as AT&amp;T improves their infrastructure, so that the vehicles connected with 4G capabilities, model year 19 and beyond, they will also start to perceive an improvement in their performance,” GM’s VP of global connected services, Santiago Chamorro, said during a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>Tom DeMaria, GM’s executive director of global connected services, added that the performance boost will not require GM pushing a significant software update to vehicles, but that the vehicles will be “seamlessly migrated.”</p>
<p>Faster and more reliable connectivity is key to many automakers’ market plans, which nearly across the board involve complex in-car software features and wireless over-the-air updates to keep everything from the music system to (if it’s an electric vehicle) the battery operational. It will also be key for other technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which are swiftly becoming another key way that automakers seek to distinguish themselves to drivers.</p>

<p>General Motors has been developing what it calls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">Super Cruise</a>, a suite of SAE Level 2 features that can temporarily take over the vehicle providing certain conditions are met, and the driver stays alert at all times. Think of it as GM’s answer to Tesla’s Autopilot, another system that is by no means “self-driving.” This tech, plus things like infotainment, all operate under the umbrella of what GM calls its vehicle intelligence platform, the underlying hardware architecture.</p>
<p>“Network connectivity is an enabler that complements really well with what GM is doing in terms of its hardware and its software,” Chamorro added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The push for renewable energy has brought offshore wind power to the forefront of many an energy company&#8217;s agenda, and that means taking a very close look at the ocean floor where the installations are to go. Fortunately <a href="https://www.bedrockocean.com/">Bedrock</a> is here to drag that mapping process into the 21st century with its autonomous underwater vehicle and modern cloud-based data service.</p>
<p>The company aims to replace the standard &#8220;big ship with a big sonar&#8221; approach with a faster, smarter, more modern service, letting companies spin up regular super-accurate seafloor imagery as easily as they might spin up a few servers to host their website.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re the first cloud-native platform for seafloor data,&#8221; said Anthony DiMare, CEO and cofounder (with CTO Charlie Chiau) of Bedrock. &#8220;This is a big data problem — how would you design the systems to support that solution? We make it a modern data service, instead of like a huge marine operation — you&#8217;re not tied to this massive piece of infrastructure floating in the water. Everything from the way we move sonars around the ocean to the way we deliver the data to engineers has been rethought.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/">Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/embed/#?secret=zvlftUI4Vv" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The product Bedrock provides customers is high-resolution maps of the seafloor, made available via Mosaic, a familiar web service that does all the analysis and hosting for you — a big step forward for an industry where &#8220;data migration&#8221; still means &#8220;shipping a box of hard drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, DiMare explained, this data was collected, processed, and stored on the ships themselves. Since they were designed to do everything from harbor inspections to deep sea surveys, they couldn&#8217;t count on having a decent internet connection, and the data is useless in its raw form. Like any other bulky data, it needs to be visualized and put in context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190870" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190870" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190870" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg" alt="Example of data in the Mosaic system from Bedrock, showing a map and trails of data points." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190870" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;These datasets are extremely large, tens of terabytes in size,&#8221; said DiMare. &#8220;Typical cloud systems aren&#8217;t the best way to manage 20,000 sonar files.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current market is more focused on detailed, near-shore data than the deep sea, since there&#8217;s a crush to take part in the growing wind energy market. This means that data is collected much closer to ordinary internet infrastructure and can be handed off for cloud-based processing and storage more easily than before. That in turn means the data can be processed and provided faster, just in time for demand to take off.</p>
<p>As DiMare explained, while there may have been a seafloor survey done in the last couple decades of a potential installation site, that&#8217;s only the first step. An initial mapping pass might have be made to confirm the years-old maps and add detail, then another for permitting, for environmental assessments, engineering, construction, and regular inspections. If this could be done with a turnkey automated process that produced even better results than crewed ships for less money, it&#8217;s a huge win for customers relying on old methods. And if the industry grows as expected to require more active monitoring of the seafloor along every U.S. coast, it&#8217;s a win for Bedrock as well, naturally.</p>

<p>To make this all happen, of course, you need a craft that can collect the data in the first place. &#8220;The AUV is a piece of technology we built solely to enable a data product,&#8221; said DiMare, but noted that, originally, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to spec out what it looked like to use an off the shelf system,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But if you want to build a hyper-scalable, very efficient system to get the best cost per square meter, you need a very specific set of features, certain sonars, the compute stack&#8230; by the time we listed all those we basically had a self-designed system. It&#8217;s faster, it&#8217;s more operationally flexible, you get better data quality, and you can do it more reliably.&#8221;</p>
<p>And amazingly, it doesn&#8217;t even need a boat — you can grab it from the back of a van and launch it from a pier or beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning one of the restrictions we put on ourselves was &#8216;no boats.&#8217; And we need to be able to fly with this thing. That totally changed our approach,&#8221; said DiMare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190869" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190869" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190869" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg" alt="View of the AUV on a beach" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=2048,1377 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190869" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AUV packs a lot into a small package, and while the sensor loadout is variable depending on the job, one aspect that defines the craft is its high-frequency sonar.</p>
<p>Sonars operate in a wide range of frequencies, from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands of hertz. Unfortunately that means that ocean-dwelling creatures, many of which can hear in that range, are inundated with background noise, sometimes to the point where it&#8217;s harmful or deters them from entering an area. Sonar operating about 200 kHz is safe for animals, but the high frequency means the signal attenuates more quickly, reducing the range to 50-75 meters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously worthless for a ship floating on the surface — much of what it needs to map is more than 75 meters deep. But if you could make a craft that always stayed within 50 meters of the seabed, it&#8217;s full of benefits. And that&#8217;s exactly what Bedrock&#8217;s AUV is designed to do.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwxPzQKd3ig?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The increased frequency of the sonar also means increased detail, so the picture its instruments paint is better than what you&#8217;d get with a larger wave. And because it&#8217;s safe to use around animals, you can skip the (very necessary but time-consuming) red tape at wildlife authorities. Better, faster, cheaper, <em>and</em> safer is a hell of a pitch.</p>
<p>Today marks the official launch of Mosaic, and to promote adoption Bedrock is offering 50 gigs of free storage — of any kind of compatible map data, since the platform is format-agnostic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of data out there that&#8217;s technically &#8220;public&#8221; but is nevertheless very difficult to find and use. It may be a low-detail survey from two decades ago, or a hyper-specific scan of an area investigated by a research group, but if it were all in one place it would probably be a lot more useful, DiMare said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately we want to get where we can do the whole ocean on a yearly basis,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer shift to buying online during the global pandemic — and keeping that habit — continues to boost revenue for makers of developer tools that help e-commerce sites provide better shopping experiences.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of the e-commerce infrastructure companies continuing to attract investor attention, and at a speedy clip, too. It closed on a $50 million Series B round from Tiger Global. This is just six months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A</a> round, led by Inovia, and follows a $4.8 million seed round in 2020.</p>
<p>The company is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, a.k.a. the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience, CEO Brian Anderson told TechCrunch. By doing this, the back end of the store, essentially where all the magic happens, can be updated and maintained without changing the front end.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is not new, but how the customer relates to it keeps changing,” he said. “The technology for online shopping is not up to snuff — when you click on something, everything has to reload compared to an app like Instagram.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nacelle raises $4.8M for its headless e-commerce platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/embed/#?secret=uZYi451zY7" data-secret="uZYi451zY7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More people shopping on their mobile devices creates friction due to downloading an app for each brand. That is “sucking the fun out of shopping online,” because no one wants that many apps on their phone, Anderson added.</p>
<p>Steven Kramer, board member and former EVP of Hybris, said via email that over the past two decades, the e-commerce industry went through several waves of innovation. Now, maturing consumer behaviors and expectations are accelerating the current phase.</p>
<p>“Retailers and brands are struggling with adopting the latest technologies to meet today’s requirements of agility, speed and user experience,” Kramer added. “Nacelle gives organizations a future-proof way to accelerate their innovation, leverage existing investments and do so with material ROI.”</p>
<p>Data already shows that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">COVID-era trends accelerated e-commerce by roughly five years</a>, and Gartner predicts that <a href="https://commercelayer.io/docs/core-concepts/composable-commerce">50% of new commerce capabilities will be incorporated as API-centric SaaS services</a> by 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those kinds of trends are bringing in competitors that are also attracting investor attention — for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/">Shopistry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/italys-commerce-layer-raises-16m-led-by-coatue-for-its-headless-commerce-platform/">Commerce Layer</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/vue-storefront/">Vue Storefront</a> are just a few of the companies that raised funding this year alone.</p>
<p>Anderson notes that the market continues to be hot and one that can’t be ignored, especially as the <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf">share of online retail sales grows</a>. He explained that some of his competitors force customers to migrate off of their current tech stack and onto their respective platforms so that their users can get a good customer experience. In contrast, Nacelle enables customers to keep their tech stack and put components together as they see fit.</p>
<p>“That is painful in any vertical, but especially for e-commerce,” he said. “That is your direct line to revenue.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nacelle itself grew 690% in the past year in terms of revenue, and customers are signing multiyear contracts, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson, who is an engineer by trade, wants to sink his teeth into new products as adoption of headless commerce grows. These include providing a dynamic layer of functionality on top of the tech stack for storefronts that are traditionally static, and even introducing some livestream capabilities later this year.</p>
<p>As such, Nacelle will invest the new round into its go-to-market strategy and expand its customer success, partner relations and product development. He said Nacelle is already “the de facto standard” for Shopify Plus merchants going headless.</p>
<p>“We want to put everything in a tailor-made API for e-commerce that lets front-end developers do their thing with ease,” Anderson added. “We also offer starter kits for merchants as a starting point to get up-and-running.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shared micromobility company Bird has unveiled a new consumer e-bike. This is the first time the company is selling private vehicles rather than relying on the shared model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s calling the bike the &#8220;Bird Bike,&#8221; which is the same name it&#8217;s using for the recently released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">shared e-bike the company launched in June</a>. As with the shared model, the bike is designed in-house, but Bird did not identify the manufacturing partner. Limited quantities of the bike, in Stealth Black and Gravity Gray, are available starting Thursday for $2,299. Bird did not specify which markets it would deliver the initial order of the e-bike to, but it hopes to make the bike broadly available from U.S. retailers this fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The electric bike market is expected to hit nearly<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/08/02/2272822/0/en/Electric-Bike-Market-E-Bike-Size-Share-to-Hit-Value-of-USD-67-96-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html"> $68 billion by 2026</a>, whereas the bike-share market is only expected to hit around<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868126/global-bikesharing-market-size/"> $13.8 billion</a> by the same year, which might point to the financial reasoning behind Bird&#8217;s announcement.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/"> Bird&#8217;s SPAC filing in May</a> revealed massively unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses, so the company appears to be trying to diversify its business lines and leverage its position as a household name in micromobility so that it can stand a chance at profitability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new e-bike is part of Bird&#8217;s consumer products portfolio which represents about 10% of its business, according to Bird&#8217;s S-4 SEC filing, but the company did not respond to requests for explanations as to why it&#8217;s decided to launch a consumer business. That said, this is not the first time Bird has tried to branch out. Back in 2019, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/bird-announces-monthly-scooter-subscription">Bird announced a monthly e-scooter subscription service</a>, but that never got the chance to take off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The future of transportation is all-electric. By expanding Bird’s consumer and shared products to include e-bikes as well as e-scooters, we are uniquely positioned to lead the revolution to eco-friendly transportation for the billions of annual trips that are five miles or less,” said Travis VanderZanden, Bird&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement. “With our new e-bike, we are creating increased opportunities for people to embrace micro electric vehicles beyond the 300 cities we partner with to provide our shared services today. Our e-bike is safe, durable and provides a stylish aesthetic and advanced technology that delivers a fun alternative to congestion-inducing, gas-powered cars.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird&#8217;s e-bike, which is about the same price as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/vanmoof-x3-review-e-bike/">VanMoof X3,</a> has a 12.8 Ah battery, powered by LG cells, that delivers up to 50 miles of range, the company says. The bike will be available in both a step-through and step-over aluminum alloy frame, and it will come with Kenda puncture-resistant tires. The pedal assist allows for speeds up to 20 miles per hour, and a thumb throttle is there for those pesky inclines. An LCD panel under the handlebars displays speed, distance and battery capacity, and bluetooth connectivity to the Bird app allows riders to turn the LED lights on and off, view battery range and miles ridden.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Metabase spun out of venture studio Expa as an easy way for people to interact with datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open-source business intelligence company <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> announced Thursday a $30 million Series B round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing investors <a href="http://www.expa.com/">Expa</a> and NEA joined in on the round, which gives the San Francisco-based company a total of $42.5 million in funding since it was founded in 2015. Metabase previously raised <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metabase-an-open-source-business-analytics-startup-closes-8-million-2019-4">$8 million in Series A funding</a> back in 2019, led by NEA.</p>
<p>Metabase was developed within venture studio Expa and spun out as an easy way for people to interact with data sets, co-founder and CEO Sameer Al-Sakran told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“When someone wants access to data, they may not know what to measure or how to use it, all they know is they have the data,” Al-Sakran said. “We provide a self-service access layer where they can ask a question, Metabase scans the data and they can use the results to build models, create a dashboard and even slice the data in ways they choose without having an analyst build out the database.”</p>
<p>He notes that not much has changed in the business intelligence realm since Tableau came out more than 15 years ago, and that computers can do more for the end user, particularly to understand what the user is going to do. Increasingly, open source is the way software and information wants to be consumed, especially for the person that just wants to pull the data themselves, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>George Mathew, managing director of Insight Partners, believes we are seeing the third generation of business intelligence tools emerging following centralized enterprise architectures like SAP, then self-service tools like Tableau and Looker and now companies like Metabase that can get users to discovery and insights quickly.</p>
<p>“The third generation is here and they are leading the charge to insights and value,” Mathew added. “In addition, the world has moved to the cloud, and BI tools need to move there, too. This generation of open source is a better and greater example of all three of those.”</p>
<p>To date, Metabase has been downloaded 98 million times and used by more than 30,000 companies across 200 countries. The company pursued another round of funding after building out a commercial offering, Metabase Enterprise, that is doing well, Al-Sakran said.</p>
<p>The new funding round enables the company to build out a sales team and continue with product development on both Metabase Enterprise and Metabase Cloud. Due to Metabase often being someone’s first business intelligence tool, he is also doubling down on resources to help educate customers on how to ask questions and learn from their data.</p>
<p>“Open source has changed from floppy disks to projects on the cloud, and we think end users have the right to see what they are running,” Al-Sakran said. “We are continuing to create new features and improve performance and overall experience in efforts to create the BI system of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most startup origin stories don&#8217;t begin on an NFL field, but that&#8217;s where founder, CEO and offensive tackle Jason Fox conceptualized the idea behind <a href="https://www.earbudsmusic.com/">Earbuds</a>. As he watched first overall draft pick Cam Newton warm up before a game in 2011, dancing to music, Fox couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what the future NFL MVP was listening to &#8212; and he bet that the crowd of 85,000 fans were curious too.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Earbuds has raised a $3 million Series A round for its social listening app, led by Ecliptic Capital with additional investment from the Andre Agassi Foundation and LFG Ventures.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/earbuds-lets-audiences-stream-the-playlists-of-athletes-entertainers-and-each-other/">its launch in 2019</a>, Earbuds has allowed users &#8212; whether they&#8217;re famous artists, NFL stars or ordinary people &#8212; to share their favorite playlists, livestream music like a DJ and comment on other people&#8217;s music picks. Some notable figures on the app include the artist Nelly and professional quarterbacks like Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes, the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/photos/ranking-the-nfl-s-biggest-contracts-for-2021">highest-paid player</a> in the NFL. Mayfield and Mahomes are also investors in the app.</p>
<p>With this recent raise, Fox and his team of six plan to expand the app to add creator monetization tools, incentivizing people to use the app. Plus, Earbuds also announced that it hired two former product and engineering leaders from Apple, David Ransom and Sean Moubry, who joined Earbuds as head of Product and head of Engineering, respectively. Tech veteran Drew Larner also came aboard as a senior advisor and investor &#8212; in 2015, he sold the streaming app Rdio to Pandora. Pandora was then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/">sold to Sirius XM for $3.5 billion</a> in 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191335" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191335" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2191335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?w=398" alt="" width="398" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=176,300 176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=398,680 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Earbuds&#8217; interface allows users to search for athlete accounts/Earbuds.</p></div></p>
<p>To use Earbuds, users must have a paid account on Spotify or Apple Music. Soon, Fox says, Earbuds should have integrations with paid versions of Amazon Music and Pandora, too. These integrations are how the app, available on both iOS and Android, is able to source music for streaming. But regardless of which platform a listener uses, they can still take advantage of the social features on Earbuds, listening along to live playlists and commenting along with other listeners.</p>
<p>When you connect your account, you&#8217;re able to easily import your existing playlists. Then, on the app, you can add voice clips to comment on your song choices. When listening to a stream, users have the option to save the playlist to their streaming service or share it as an Instagram story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fox declined to share monthly active user numbers, but expressed confidence that soliciting users from other streaming platforms&#8217; existing subscriber base won&#8217;t be a big hurdle for user acquisition; when it comes to paid streaming music subscribers, Spotify has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">165 million users</a>, Apple Music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">at least 60 million</a> and Amazon music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">at least 55 million</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to continue to add additional streaming partners to accommodate everyone. We want to connect with all users regardless of what platform they use,&#8221; Fox said.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fox wants more musical artists to use the app, but given his background as an NFL player, much of the company&#8217;s existing marketing has been targeted toward athletes and sports fans &#8212; a particularly interesting potential market for Earbuds is NCAA athletes, who are </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/how-college-athletes-can-make-money-according-to-new-ncaa-nil-policy.html">newly able to monetize</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> their image and likeness. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the quarterback before the big rivalry game, and they want to be able to monetize the fans while they&#8217;re listening to music and getting amped up with them before the game,&#8221; Fox explained.</p>
<p>Since these monetization tools haven&#8217;t rolled out yet, there&#8217;s currently no in-app purchases available on Earbuds. This would give Earbuds, which isn&#8217;t yet profitable, another income stream. So far, the app has made money through in-app sponsored posts from partners like the NBA, the NFL playoffs, smart speaker companies and beverage companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can continue to do that, but we feel like the majority of growth and revenue moving forward will be through partnerships, integrations and supporting the creator economy,&#8221; Fox said. Currently, Earbuds has a partnership with Apple Music, so if someone subscribes to the platform via Earbuds, Earbuds gets a cut of their subscription payment.</p>
<p>As streaming services like Spotify grow, social listening apps like Earbuds are emerging too. Spotify itself has rolled out more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">social listening features</a> lately, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">Music + Talk</a> platform similar to Earbuds&#8217; existing offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fontinalis.com/">Fontinalis Partners</a>, a 12-year-old, Detroit-based venture firm that was among the earliest early-stage venture outfits to focus squarely on mobility, has collected $104 million in capital commitments for its third and newest fund.</p>
<p>Investors in the vehicle include Ford Motor Corp., whose executive chairman, Bill Ford, cofounded Fontinalis and continues to help manage the fund. It also collected commitments from roughly 30 other limited partners, ranging from corporate partners in the automotive and insurance industries to family offices.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s interpretation of mobility as pertaining to any startup that &#8220;enables efficient movement&#8221; has resulted in a wide range of bets. Fontinalis had nabbed a stake in Postmates, for example, which was acquired last year in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">all-stock deal</a> by Uber. It wrote a check to Lyft,  and helped fund the self-driving startup nuTonomy, which sold to auto supplier Delphi Automotive in 2017 for $450 million.</p>
<p>It has also more recently funded <a href="https://gatik.ai/">Gatik</a>, a startup developing an autonomous vehicle stack for B2B short-haul logistics; <a href="https://www.robust.ai/">Robust.AI</a>, a startup at work on an industrial-grade cognitive platform for robots; <a href="https://www.helm.ai/">Helm.ai</a>, a maker of driverless car AI; and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/freightwaves-raises-16m-for-new-sustainability-platform/">FreightWaves</a>, a data and content startup that aims to provide participants in the freight wave industry with near-time analytics.</p>
<p>Altogether, the firm has invested in roughly 55 companies, and it says that 20 of them have already seen exits, including the family tracking app Life360, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-life360-ipo-australia/u-s-family-tracking-app-life360-launches-104-million-australian-ipo-idUSKCN1RU0AF">went public</a> on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2019, and lidar sensor manufacturer Ouster, which became <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005256/en/Ouster-to-Begin-Trading-on-the-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Today-Under-Ticker-Symbol-%E2%80%9COUST%E2%80%9D">publicly traded in March</a> in the U.S. by merging with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>As for the size of its newest fund &#8212; which is roughly the same size as the firm&#8217;s $100 million second fund &#8212; there&#8217;s a reason Fontinalis hasn&#8217;t raised a much larger vehicle (no pun intended) unlike other investors who&#8217;ve been routinely doubling their fund sizes every couple of years.</p>
<p>As Fontinalis cofounder Chris Cheever and longtime partner Chris Stallman tell it, Fontinalis could be investing more dollars (and making more money in management fees). Instead, their team sees their job as finding the best deals within their mandate, then, after funding those companies, opening up more opportunities for the firm&#8217;s limited partners to directly co-invest alongside the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of LPs in this fund that have a pretty considerable appetite for co-investment opportunities,&#8221; says Stallman,&#8221;so there&#8217;s a lot of flexibility for us to scale up through them.&#8221; Adds Cheever of the network Fontinalis brings to deals, &#8220;Many of these parties could be key customers that startups are looking to access, but also simply be their partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fontinalis now has $270 million in assets under management. Cheever and Stallman say it has already made five investments in Series A-stage or later companies out of its newest fund; it has also written separate checks to six seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>Among its newest bets is an additive manufacturing company that has not publicly disclosed the round yet. It also recently wrote a follow-on check into <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/on-heels-of-253m-raise-highland-electric-lands-biggest-electric-school-bus-contract-in-the-u.s">Highland Electric</a>, a company that&#8217;s focused on helping school systems adopt electric buses by helping them upgrade their infrastructure, manage their charging, train their drivers and by providing them with financing options for the buses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founders JT Garwood and Jack Miller started Bttn after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coming off a $1.5 million seed round in June, <a href="https://bttnusa.com/">bttn.</a> announced Thursday that it secured another $5 million extension, led by FUSE, to the round to give it a $26.5 million post-money valuation.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company was founded in March 2021 by JT Garwood and Jack Miller after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.</p>
<p>“We went into this building on the pain points customers had dealing with a system that is so archaic and outdated — most were still faxing in order forms and keeping closets full of supplies, but not knowing what was there,” Garwood, CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bttn. is going after the <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/medical-supplies-wholesaling-united-states/">U.S. wholesale medical supply market</a>, which is predicted to be valued at $243.3 billion by the end of 2021, according to IBISWorld. The company created a business-to-business e-commerce platform with a variety of high-quality medical supplies, saving customers an average of between 20% and 40%, while providing a better ordering and shipping experience, Garwood said.</p>
<p>It now boasts more than 300 customers, including individual practices and surgical centers, and multiple government contracts. It is also currently the preferred supplier for over 17 healthcare associations across the country, Garwood said. In addition to expanding into dental supplies, bttn. is also attracting customers like senior living facilities and home and hospice care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Garwood intends to use the funds to expand bttn.’s technology, sales and operations teams, and increase its partnerships. The company is also adding new features like a portal to track shipments more easily, better order automation and improve the ability to control when supplies will get to them.</p>
<p>Bttn. is also analyzing more of the data coming in from its marketplace to recognize where the trends are coming from, including hospitalization rates, to share with customers. For example, if hospitals are overcrowded, supply shortages will follow, Garwood said.</p>
<p>“The medical supply industry was built on inequity, and we have a sense of duty to build a product that enables a better future for our customers,” he added. “We can proactively let customers know that spikes are expected, provide them with correct information and give that power back to the consumers and healthcare providers in ways they never had before.”</p>
<p>Whereas bttn.’s first seed round was “about pouring gas on the fire,” partnering with FUSE this time around was an easy decision for Garwood, who said the firm is bringing new assets to the table.</p>
<p>Brendan Wales, general partner at FUSE, said via email that his firm backs promising entrepreneurs building businesses in the Pacific Northwest and discovered bttn. before they announced any funding.</p>
<p>He said there is massive consumerization of healthcare, most evident on the patient side for years, but now becoming so on the provider side. Medical office employees are looking for the same type of customer experience they get from online businesses they frequently shop at, and bttn. “has a relentless drive to provide the same type of experiences and interactions to health providers.”</p>
<p>“We fell in love with the idea of providing a transparent and delightful customer experience to health providers, something that has been sorely lacking,” Wales added. “That, tied in with a young and ambitious team, made it so that our entire partnership worked tirelessly to partner with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May 2020, a trio of friends rented a home in Tulum, Mexico and invited their internet friends. The project was dubbed The Launch House, and the 18 entrepreneurs who came to live there had to do the following: pay rent, launch projects, and build their company in public. Other homes began popping across the world around the same time, as a nod to old school hacker homes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/"> but built for the remote work era of the coronavirus. </a></p>
<p>Over a year later,<a href="https://www.launchhouse.co/"> Launch House</a> has expanded its physical and digital presence beyond a one-off project. The trio &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/callmehouck">Michael Houck</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thatguyBG">Brett Goldstein</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobdpeters/"> Jacob Peters</a> &#8211; announced that they’ve raised $3 million to expand their residency program, physically and digitally. Next fall, Launch House will launch LA and NYC-specific programs, as well as residencies built to gather people within Web 3.0, fintech, B2B enterprise, and the creator economy.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Flybridge Capital Partners, with participation from Day One Ventures and Graph Ventures. More than 100 angel investors also put money into the company as well, including 60 early Launch House members and notable techies including Alexia Bonatsos, Balaji Srinivasan and Mike Duboe.</p>

<h2><strong>Tulum to now </strong></h2>
<p>Since its Tulum origins, Launch House has grown to focus on a more cohort-based approach. Entrepreneurs are invited to take up a 4-week, live-in residency at Paris Hilton’s former Beverly Hills Mansion, which the company has rented out. To date, over 200 people across 8 cohorts have gone through the Launch House to bring their ideas to the seed stage.</p>
<p>Here’s where it goes beyond the traditional hacker home. The in-person residencies are viewed as on-boarding events into the broader Launch House community, which includes digital and physical events, services that help with scaling startups, and in-house social networks. Houck, a former product manager at Airbnb, is working on a service that allows Launch House community members to invite other members to stay at their homes for residency.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s next chapter, dubbed Season 2 will include new sector-based houses in New York and Los Angeles, the team stressed a bigger focus on digital spaces. While describing the transition of offline communities into online ones, Goldstein gave the metaphor of religion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are tons of important religious sites in the world, like Mecca and The Wailing Wall, but you can be a good member of that religion without going to those places &#8211; and actually, most people don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. The co-founder thinks the same can be said of Launch House participants, who maybe never step foot in a home but are active members of the community virtually.</p>

<p>“We see ourselves less as a hacker home and more as a venture-scaled membership community,” Goldstein said. “These physical [spaces] are just an initial wedge to drive deep connections.” The company’s bet, therefore, is that it can help spin out enough successful startups that its name has the signal of a prestigious program &#8211; and thus get more members as its brand grows.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>While most startups are at the early stage, some have begun to break out and go on to raise from Y Combinator, Sequoia, Village Global, and even Beyonce and Jay Z. Startups formed at the house include Showtime, Compose, Colabra, while others like Wombo and TagMango hit milestones and fundraising goals while participating in the home.</p>
<p>Unlike other early-stage accelerators like Y Combinator, Launch House doesn’t take equity in any of the startups that launch out of their community.</p>
<p>“Great founders have tons of options, and we think that in order to get people into your community you can&#8217;t demand equity upfront,” Goldstein said. “It&#8217;s kind of an antiquated model.” Instead, Launch House makes money through a membership-fee model. Live-in members are given a one year free membership to the community with residency costs, and then after that it is an annual subscription.</p>
<p><strong>‘10X better’ than WeWork</strong></p>
<p>The startup’s scale could be somewhat curbed if it only can grow through physical spaces, which is part of the reason it may be beginning to focus more on the digital world. WeWork, for example, gave many lessons, one of which was about how hard a business flexible office space truly is.</p>
<p>As for if the infamous real estate company tarnished investor interest in entrepreneur hubs, Peters pointed to Launch House’s lead investor in today’s round: Jesse Middleton of Flybridge Ventures. Middleton formerly built WeWork Labs, which the co-founders say give them a direct perspective on how to build in a “10X better” way than the nearly public company.</p>
<p>The other challenge for Launch House will be curating a diverse group of engaged community members, a struggle that every online community goes through.</p>
<p>The residency’s application process currently evaluates members on three categories: how exciting a person is as a founder, how exciting their company is, and how much benefit they would get from joining this community right now, which can range from stage of company to who else is in the cohort that month. Once the Launch House team goes through the cohort, a pool of 50 Launch House community members work as volunteers to interview the potential members. Finally, the co-founders do a final check before sending out offers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191484" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191484" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2191484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191484" class="wp-caption-text">Launch House co-founders</p></div></p>
<p>It’s an intensive process that, if not done intentionally, could limit who gets access to the Launch House by rewarding those who lean into each other’s echo-chambers. Launch House said that it has had cohorts in the past with 40% underrepresented founders, but that its current cohort is approximately 25% POC.</p>
<p>As the company grows its member base, it will have new pressures to deal with around diversity and making sure its customers are seeing themselves represented in the homes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Houck explained that the company recently put together a Diversity Council that meets every few months to discuss new initiatives, which include creating a scholarship program to help candidates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds afford the program. The program has dispersed $20,000 in 2 months. The company has also hired someone to form partnerships with underrepresented founder communities.</span></p>
<p>Launch House has raised money during a time where many of its potential customers are rethinking the work day, and life, they want. With fresh plans to expand, the startup has the opportunity to intentionally build a network that wouldn’t have existed in Silicon Valley before the pandemic &#8211; and will have ripple effects long after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s journey toward making virtual reality a thing has been long and circuitous, but despite mixed success in finding a wide audience for VR, they have managed to build some very nice hardware along the way. What&#8217;s fairly ironic is that while Facebook has managed to succeed in finessing the hardware and operating system of its Oculus devices &#8212; things it had never done before &#8212; over the years it has struggled most with actually making a good app for VR.</p>
<p>The company has released a number of social VR apps over the years, and while each of them managed to do something right, none of them did anything quite well enough to stave off a shutdown. Setting aside the fact that most VR users don&#8217;t have a ton of other friends that also own VR headsets, the broadest issue plaguing these social apps was that they never really gave users a great reason to use them. While watching 360-videos or playing board games with friends were interesting gimmicks, it&#8217;s taken the company an awful lot of time to understand that a dedicated ”social” app doesn&#8217;t make much sense in VR and that users haven&#8217;t been looking for a standalone social app, so much as they&#8217;ve been looking for engaging experiences that were improved by social dynamics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zuckerberg is turning trillion-dollar Facebook into a &#8216;metaverse&#8217; company, he tells investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/embed/#?secret=mPEuKjFys6" data-secret="mPEuKjFys6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This all brings me to what Facebook showed me a demo of this week — a workplace app called Horizon Workrooms which is launching in open beta for Quest 2 users starting today.</p>
<p>The app seems to be geared towards providing work-from-home employees a virtual reality sphere to collaborate inside. Users can link their Mac or PC to Workrooms and livestream their desktop to the app while the Quest 2&#8217;s passthrough cameras allow users to type on their physical keyboard. Users can chat with one another as avatars and share photos and files or draw on a virtual whiteboard. It&#8217;s an app that would have made a more significant splash for the Quest 2 platform had it launched earlier in the pandemic, though it&#8217;s tackling an issue that still looms large among tech savvy offices &#8212; finding tech solutions to aid meaningful collaboration in a remote environment.</p>
<p>Horizon Workrooms isn&#8217;t a social app per se but the way it approaches social communication in VR is more thoughtful than any other first-party social VR app that Facebook has shipped. The spatial elements are less overt and gimmicky than most VR apps and simply add to an already great functional experience that, at times, felt more productive and engaging than a normal video call.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2191478" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizon-Workrooms-Still-6.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It all plays into CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s recent proclamation that Facebook is transitioning into becoming a &#8220;metaverse company.”</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s the metaverse? In Zuckerberg&#8217;s own words, “It’s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. You can kind of think of this as an embodied internet that you’re inside of rather than just looking at.” This certainly sounds like a fairly significant recalibration for Facebook, which has generally approached AR/VR as a wholly separate entity from its suite of mobile apps. Desktop users and VR users have been effectively siloed from each other over the years.</p>
<p>Generally, Facebook has been scaling Oculus like they&#8217;re building the next smartphone, building its headsets with a native app paradigm at their core. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg&#8217;s future-minded &#8220;metaverse&#8221; sounds much more like what Roblox has been building towards than anything Facebook has actually shipped. Horizon Workrooms is living under the Horizon brand which seems to be where Facebook’s future metaverse play is rooted. The VR social platform is interestingly still in closed beta after being announced nearly two years ago. If Facebook can ever see Horizon’s vision to fruition, it could grow to become a Roblox-like hub of user-created games, activities and groups that replaces the native app mobile dynamics with a more fluid social experience.</p>
<p>The polish of Workrooms is certainly a promising sign of where Facebook could be moving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Needing to get your car fixed is like having a toothache: It’s painful, hard to ignore and likely means someone messing around under the hood. RepairSmith, launched in 2019, wants to make that process a little smoother through its mobile auto repair service that sends a mechanic right to the driver’s home.</p>
<p>The startup is already in seven states and now, with a new round of $42 million funding, is looking to grow its operations to encompass every major metropolitan area in the U.S. by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally what we&#8217;re doing here is e-commerce plus logistics,” Milne said. “We&#8217;re trying to disrupt probably the biggest retail industry that&#8217;s untouched by tech.” RepairSmith aims to do so by letting customers book an appointment online and have a mechanic perform an inspection or repair from their driveway, a far cry from the conventional auto repair process.</p>
<p>RepairSmith was incepted at Mercedes-Benz’ incubator program, and the company’s first few funding rounds were furnished solely by the automaker. Now that RepairSmith has a solid footing in multiple metros, with the data to show it’s an attractive business, the company decided to bring in new investors TI Capital, Porsche Ventures and Spring Mountain Capital to the latest Series B, in addition to Mercedes.</p>
<p>“We built this business from the beginning to be multibrand as an industry solution,” RepairSmith CEO Joel Milne told TechCrunch in an interview. “While [Mercedes] seeded it, it was never meant to be a Mercedes solution. That was always the intent.”</p>
<p>Depending on the market, users can have a repair technician at their home in as little as one or two days. Milne said around 90% of appointments can be completed on-site. For those remaining 10% or so, the customer can either drive their car (or if it’s not drivable) have it towed to a network of auto body shops that have partnered with RepairSmith.</p>
<p>In some cases, the customer knows what is wrong with their car in advance, but when they don’t, RepairSmith schedules an inspection visit and generates a quote for the service after.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched focusing on the consumer market, but it’s also expanded to working with fleets, rental car agencies and dealerships. A little over a quarter of the company’s services are now B2B. “They’re both equally big markets and very attractive opportunities for us,” Milne said. “It&#8217;s really a function of, we focused on consumer first, but part of this capital raise [is] we&#8217;re aggressively growing out our B2B services.”</p>
<p>All RepairSmith technicians are also employees, rather than contractors, a decision that ultimately came down to wanting to attract top talent.</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t feel that we could be competitive in recruiting the quality of technicians we were looking for, not giving them standard employment terms. All technicians at repair shops are employees today, and that&#8217;s the market that we compete in for labor,” Milne said. He added that the company also didn’t want to have to deal with legal issues over what counts as a contractor versus employee.</p>
<p>The startup has big goals — entering all major metro markets by the end of next year, which doesn’t just include hiring more auto technicians but also continuing to improve the company’s software and logistics platform, which it built from the ground up. Milne demurred on whether it might need additional capital to get there. “Ultimately, if the market is good, we&#8217;ll be looking for further investment to grow, whether it&#8217;s internationally, whether it&#8217;s to grow our service offering. But this raise gets us a long way on the way there, depending on how fast we want to go.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has rolled out India’s first celebrity voice feature on Alexa with the nation’s biggest movie star Amitabh Bachchan as the company makes a push to lure more users in the world’s second-most populated nation.</p>
<p>The company, which rolled out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/alexa-gets-an-improved-voice-and-can-now-sound-like-samuel-l-jackson-too/">voice of Samuel Jackson on Alexa in the U.S. in 2019</a>, said users in India can add the Bollywood legend’s voice to their Echo devices or Amazon shopping app for an introductory price of 149 Indian rupees ($2) for the first year. (Starting second year, the annual price will move to $4.)</p>
<p>The 78-year-old actor is providing Amazon with stories from his life, a selection of poems from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harivansh_Rai_Bachchan">his father</a>, tongue twisters, and motivational quotes. Amazon customers can also ask Alexa to play music, set alarms, get weather updates and get answers in Bachchan’s signature style.</p>
<p>And the company said it is also applying neural speech technology to make Alexa sound like Bachchan even if there&#8217;s no direct pre-recording. (Amit ji, remind me to ask you about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/">Amazon&#8217;s antitrust situation in India</a> later today.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191491" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191491" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191491 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=300,295 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=768,754 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=680,668 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191491" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>“Working with Amazon to introduce my voice on Alexa was a new experience in bringing together the magic of voice technology and artistic creativity. I am excited that my well-wishers can now interact with me via this new medium, and looking forward to hear how they feel about this,” said Bachchan in a statement.</p>
<p>A household name, Bachchan emerged as Bollywood’s top star in the 1970s playing characters who battled corruption and social injustice. He has also done scores of advertisements for brands and initiatives from everything including hair oil, biscuits, cold drinks, jewelry, state tourism, banks to UNICEF-backed polio vaccination campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company announced its collaboration with Bollywood legend last year. But the pandemic forced Amazon&#8217;s engineering teams to work remotely for this project. There were also additional complications. Globally, users can trigger Alexa with one-word wake alert. Alexa, do this, for instance. But in case of Bachchan, Amazon has introduce a two-word wake system to Alexa. &#8220;Amit ji.&#8221; (Where &#8216;ji&#8217; is a Hindi word to pay respect.)</p>
<p>“At Amazon &amp; Alexa, we consistently innovate on behalf of our customers and building the Amitabh Bachchan celebrity voice experience with one of India’s most iconic voices has been a labor of love. Creating the world’s first bi-lingual celebrity voice required us to invent &amp; re-invent across almost every element of speech science – wake word, speech recognition, neural text-to-speech and more,” said Puneesh Kumar, Country Leader for Alexa, Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“While we are proud of the many India-first innovations and desi-delighters in this, it’s still Day 1 and we will continue to enrich this experience as science evolves.”</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">deployed over $6.5 billion</a> and is increasingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/amazon-backs-indian-wealth-management-service-smallcase-in-40-million-funding/">making investment in startups</a>. This isn&#8217;t the first time the company has signed up Bachchan for one of its businesses. The company last year acquired Bachchan&#8217;s &#8220;Gulabo Sitabo&#8221; movie rights for streaming globally on Prime Video.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The most critical phase in a marketing team’s mix and overall multichannel strategy happens after you press send on an email campaign: the post-send and performance pillars of email marketing.</p>
<p>During this phase, marketers should gather metrics and data to guide insights impacting future emails and entire marketing campaigns. Email metrics can influence ad messaging and social posts and guide the design, content and product marketing teams. When used strategically, these metrics increase email programs’ ROI while raising marketing channel and workflow efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>As one of the most lucrative channels for reaching target audiences — for every dollar invested in email marketing, brands <a href="https://www.litmus.com/2020StateofEmail">receive $36 in return</a> — email enables brands to reach their core consumer base: email subscribers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Just as they adjusted to accommodate the evolution from print to digital, marketers must pivot and accommodate this new disruption to remain competitive — and successful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>They have opted-in to email touch points because they <em>want</em> to hear from the brand. By applying these insights via analytics, marketers optimize marketing spend and messaging to hit business goals.</p>
<p>Email impacts marketing strategy and enables better overall business success. It’s the lifeblood of an effective multichannel campaign. However, Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection — announced earlier this summer with its iOS 15 update — attempts to eliminate metrics and data associated with email.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://emailclientmarketshare.com/">Litmus Email Client Market Share</a>, in 2020, Apple iPhone, Apple Mail and Apple iPad accounted for nearly half of all email opens. Lacking these insights will create marketing roadblocks for segmented and personalized touch points. Marketers and businesses must prepare by adjusting email strategy and processes before the update occurs.</p>
<p>Companies and consumers have talked about privacy quite a bit lately. Companies fearing breaches, reputation damage and potentially lost revenue want to protect consumer data. Consumer awareness of privacy concerns has grown, too.</p>
<p>In a 2021 survey, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228234/online-privacy-concerns-us/">over half the respondents</a> expressed more concern about online privacy than in 2020. Consumers expect brands to demonstrate trustworthiness before they willingly share sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>Recognizing an increased desire for better privacy control, Apple revealed new privacy protections in its iOS 15 update, including its Mail Privacy Protection. Apple Mail users may hide their IP addresses, locations and additional data from senders, preventing brands from pulling information like open rates and location. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">Apple said that</a> “Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user.”</p>
<p>What does this update mean for marketers? The potential disappearance of a critical phase in the marketing mix and multichannel strategy: the post-send and performance pillars of email marketing. No open-rate-specific data &#8212; the brand will appear to have a 100% open rate.</p>
