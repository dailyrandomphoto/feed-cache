										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1e18a952-5bd7-4ac9-9288-a720a77befc0?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, the Equity team brought on <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavingia</a> and <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a> General Partner <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33">Elizabeth Yin</a> to talk about equity crowdfunding. It’s been about a week since the SEC increased the equity crowdfunding cap from $1.07 million to $5 million, creating the perfect opportunity to go beyond the dollar amount and understand how the change impacts founders, venture capitalists, retail investors, and future fund managers.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief rundown of the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>We talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">the basics of this new SEC regulation</a>, and understand which platforms might be leading the pack for these bootstrapped campaigns. Indiegogo’s founder wrote a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/a-report-card-for-the-secs-new-equity-crowdfunding-rules/">n op-ed grading the new regulations</a> on the site.</li>
<li>Some banter on Gumroad’s 12-hour campaign that led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/gumroad-wants-to-make-equity-crowdfunding-mainstream/">a successfully crowdsourced $5 million for the company</a>. Lavingia talks about his decision to crowdfund a round in his company, why it made sense for the company, and what it will take to make this raise mainstream.</li>
<li>Of course, Yin shared a ton of helpful nuggets around crowdfunding, providing a venture capital perspective that was still bullish on growing the amount of check-writers in the ecosystem. Some recent equity crowdfunding campaigns have shown that there are thousands of individuals willing to fund the enterprises they want to see succeed. Juked.gg is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">one such example</a>.</li>
<li>There are also notes on the Testing the Waters dynamic that could usher some wiggle room to early-stage founders thinking about this.</li>
<li>Will equity crowdfunding supplant venture capital, or will it merely augment it? Our discussion leads us to ponder both possibilities. What seems clear is that equity crowdfunding could widen the band of companies that are &#8220;backable,&#8221; if not the band of companies that traditional venture capital players find enticing.</li>
<li>And we end with a whole bunch of meta debates, from the role of the platform in vetting campaigns. As with every innovation, including crowdfunding itself, there will be fraud and failure. But if there will be enough bad news to limit consumer interest is far from certain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of those nerdy topics that gets us really excited about the future of dollar allocation and startup creation. We hope you love the show and leave with a better understanding of what’s ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, former Glossier executives Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2020/03/10/ex-glossier-exec-turns-customers-into-partners-with-new-personal-care-startup/?sh=5c0540161045">unveiled a new e-commerce startup called Arfa</a>. Today, they&#8217;re announcing a new vision for the company, along with a new name, new funding and an acquisition.</p>
<p>The name first: Moving forward, the New York startup will be known as <a href="https://chord.co/">Chord</a>, which Davis (Chord&#8217;s chairman and COO) said reflects the fact that the startup is now &#8220;exclusively focused on our technology offering,&#8221; rather than on launching its own direct-to-consumer brands. (Davis also said that Chord will be sharing more news around plans for its existing brands soon.)</p>
<p>Mahoney (Chord&#8217;s CEO) said the platform provides brands with &#8220;commerce as a service.&#8221; In other words, as a business moves into the world of headless commerce (where they buy e-commerce infrastructure that&#8217;s separate from the front-end experience), Chord is designed to provide all of their needs, across multiple products and features including content management, a customer data platform and order management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Davis suggested that due to issues like insufficient data infrastructure and increasingly complex, multi-channel businesses, &#8220;Operators have been forced to make compromises and tradeoffs on their core business. We want to get rid of that as a concept. Your tech stack is here to support you.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?w=680" alt="Chord founders" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129627" class="wp-caption-text">Chord founders Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney</p></div></p>
<p>And while there are certainly plenty of other headless commerce startups, when you look across the e-commerce landscape, Davis said, &#8220;Everyone’s fighting with same tools to do the same thing. Rather that bring another headless solution to access those same tools, we wanted to bring along an offering that made you differentiated and better.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one example of how Chord is different, Mahoney said that its customer data platform is something &#8220;we bake into everything we do,&#8221; offering &#8220;a single analytical layer&#8221; that&#8217;s collecting data across the platform.</p>
<p>The startup has also acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/yaguara-nabs-7-2m-seed-to-help-e-commerce-companies-understand-customers-better/">Denver-based e-commerce data startup Yaguara</a> for an undisclosed sum. With the Yaguara team joining Chord, Davis said the startup will be able to &#8220;double down&#8221; on data and data visualization.</p>
<p>And, as mention, the company has also raised an $18 million Series A, bringing its total funding to $25 million,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arfa/company_financials"> according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by Eclipse Ventures.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mahoney said the company&#8217;s vision is to &#8220;be known as the Stripe of headless commerce — the way that they have built the infrastructure powering payments on the internet, we want to power headless commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might expect that a startup that makes community building software would be thriving during a pandemic when it&#8217;s so difficult for us to be together. And <a href="http://bevy.com/">Bevy</a>, a company whose product powers community sites like <a href="https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/">Salesforce Trailblazers</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdg">Google Developers</a> announced it has raised a $40 million Series C this morning, at least partly due to the growth related to that dynamic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Accel with participation from Upfront Ventures, Qualtrics co-founder Ryan Smith and LinkedIn, but what makes this investment remarkable is that it included 25 Black investors representing 20% of the investment.</p>
<p>One of those investors, James Lowery, who is a management consultant and entrepreneur, and was the first Black employee hired at McKinsey in 1968, sees the opportunity for this approach to be a model to attract investment from other under-represented groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I know for a fact because of my friendship and my network that there are a lot of people, if they had the opportunity to invest in opportunities like this, they will do it, and they have the money to do it. And I think we can be the model for the nation,&#8221; Lowery said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of Black VC investment in startups like Bevy. In fact, only around <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/campaigns/us/audit/survey/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey-dashboard.html">3% of venture capitalists</a> are Black and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/81-of-vc-firms-dont-have-a-single-black-investor-blck-vc-plans-on-changing-that/">81% of VC firms</a> don&#8217;t have a single Black investor.</p>
<p>Kobie Fuller, who is general Partner at investor Upfront Ventures, a Bevy board member and runs his own community called <a href="https://valence.community/">Valence</a>, says that investments like this can lead to a flywheel effect that can lead to increasing Black investment in startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;So for me, it&#8217;s about how do we get more Black investors on cap tables of companies early in their lifecycle before they go public, where wealth can be created. How do we get key members of executive teams being Black executives who have the ability to create wealth through options and equity. And how do we also make sure that we have proper representation on the boards of these companies, so that we can make sure that the CEOs and the C suite is held accountable towards the diversity goals,&#8221; Fuller said.</p>
<p>He sees a software platform like Bevy that facilitates community as a logical starting point for this approach, and the company needs to look like the broader communities it serves. &#8220;Making sure that our workforce is appropriately represented from a perspective of having appropriate level of Black employees to the board to the actual investors is just good business sense,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But the diversity angle doesn&#8217;t stop with the investor group. Bevy CEO and co-founder Derek Anderson says that last May when George Floyd was killed, his firm didn&#8217;t have a single person of color among the company&#8217;s 27 employees and not a single Black investor in his cap table. He wanted to change that, and he found that in diversifying, it not only was the right thing to do from a human perspective, it was also from a business one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that if we really started including people from the Black and Brown communities inside of Bevy that the collective bar of a talent was going to go up. We were going to look from a broader pool of candidates, and what we found as we&#8217;ve done this is that as the culture has started to change, the customer satisfaction is going up, our profits and our revenues &#8212; the trajectory is going up &#8212; and I see this thing is completely correlated,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>
<p>Last summer the company set a two year goal to get to 20% of employees being Black. While the number of employees is small, Bevy went from zero to 5% in June, 10% by September. Today it is just under 15% and expects to hit the 20% goal by summer, a year ahead of the goal it set last year.</p>

<p>Bevy grew out of a community called Startup Grind that Anderson started several years ago. Unable to find software to run and manage the community, he decided to build it himself. In 2017, he spun that product into a separate company that became Bevy, and he has raised $60 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>In addition to Salesforce and Google, other large enterprises are using Bevy to power their communities and events including Adobe, Atlassian, Twilio, Slack and Zendesk.</p>
<p>Today, the startup is valued at $325 million, which is 4x the amount it was valued at when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/bevy-series-b/">its $15 million Series B</a> in May 2019. It expects to reach $30 million in ARR by the end of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early this month Google quietly began trials of &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;: Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">planned replacement</a> adtech for tracking cookies, as it works toward phasing out support for third party cookies in the Chrome browser &#8212; testing a system to reconfigure the dominant web architecture by replacing individual ad targeting with ads that target groups of users (aka Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoCs), and which &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">it loudly contended </a>&#8212; will still generate a fat upside for advertisers.</p>
<p>There are a number of gigantic questions about this plan. Not least whether targeting groups of people who are non-transparently stuck into algorithmically computed interest-based buckets based on their browsing history is going to reduce the harms that have come to be widely associated with behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>If your concern is online ads which discriminate against protected groups or seek to exploit vulnerable people (e.g. those with a gambling addiction), FLoCs may very well just serve up more of the abusive same. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a> has, for example, called FLoCs a &#8220;terrible idea&#8221;, warning the system may amplify problems like discrimination and predatory targeting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Advertisers also query whether FLoCs will really generate like-for-like revenue, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">Google claims</a>.</p>
<p>Competition concerns are also closely dogging Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">under investigation by UK antitrust regulators</a> &#8212; and has drawn scrutiny from the US Department of Justice too, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-exclusive-idUSKBN2BA10I">Reuters</a> reported recently.</p>
<p>Adtech players complain the shift will merely increase Google&#8217;s gatekeeper power over them by blocking their access to web users&#8217; data even as Google can continue to track its own users &#8212; leveraging that first party data alongside a new moat they claim will keep them in the dark about what individuals are doing online. (Though whether it will <em>actually</em> do that is not at all clear.)</p>
<p>Antitrust is of course a convenient argument for the adtech industry to use to strategically counter the prospect of privacy protections for individuals. But competition regulators on both sides of the pond are concerned enough over the power dynamics of Google ending support for tracking cookies that they&#8217;re taking a closer look.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the question of privacy itself &#8212; which obviously merits close scrutiny too.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s sales pitch for the &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; is evident in its choice of brand name &#8212; which suggests its keen to push the perception of a technology that protects privacy.</p>
<p>This is Google&#8217;s response to the rising store of value being placed on protecting personal data &#8212; after years of data breach and data misuse scandals.</p>
<p>A terrible reputation now dogs the tracking industry (or the &#8220;data industrial complex&#8221;, as Apple likes to denounce it) &#8212; as a result of high profile scandals like Kremlin-fuelled voter manipulation in the US but also just the demonstrable dislike web users have of being ad-stalking around the Internet. (Very evident in the ever increasing use of tracker- and ad-blockers; and in the response of other web browsers which have adopted a number of anti-tracking measures years ahead of Google-owned Chrome).</p>
<p>Given Google&#8217;s hunger for its Privacy Sandbox to be perceived as pro-privacy it&#8217;s perhaps no small irony, then, that it&#8217;s not actually running these origin tests of FLoCs in Europe &#8212; where the world&#8217;s most stringent and comprehensive online privacy laws apply.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/">AdExchanger</a> reported yesterday on comments made by a Google engineer d<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uring a meeting of the Improving Web Advertising Business Group at the World Wide Web Consortium on Tuesday. </span>“For countries in Europe, we will not be turning on origin trials [of FLoC] for users in EEA [European Economic Area] countries,” <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Michael Kleber is reported to have said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch had a confirm from Google in early March that this is the case. </span>&#8220;Initially, we plan to begin origin trials in the US and plan to carry this out internationally (including in the UK / EEA) at a later date,&#8221; a spokesman told us earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve shared, we are in active discussions with independent authorities &#8212; including privacy regulators and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority &#8212; as with other matters they are critical to identifying and shaping the best approach for us, for online privacy, for the industry and world as a whole,&#8221; he added then.</p>
<p>At issue here is the fact that Google has chosen to auto-enrol sites in the FLoC origin trials &#8212; rather than getting manual sign ups which would have offered a path for it to implement a consent flow.</p>
<p>And lack of consent to process personal data seems to be the legal area of concern for conducting such online tests in Europe where legislation like the ePrivacy Directive (which covers tracking cookies) and the more recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which further strengthens requirements for consent as a legal basis, both apply.</p>
<p>Asked how consent is being handled for the trials Google&#8217;s spokesman told us that some controls will be coming in April: &#8220;With the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/privacy-sandbox-in-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/privacy-sandbox-in-2021.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616666664189000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-Dvh_YOZArpHRJ3Izq3TVWcZIsw">Chrome 90 release </a>in April, we’ll be releasing the first controls for the Privacy Sandbox (first, a simple on/off), and we plan to expand on these controls in future Chrome releases, as more proposals reach the origin trial stage, and we receive more feedback from end users and industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not clear why </span>Google is auto-enrolling sites into the trial rather than asking for opt-ins &#8212; beyond the obvious that such a step would add friction and introduce another layer of complexity by limiting the size of the test pool to only those who would consent. Google presumably doesn&#8217;t want to be so straightjacketed during product dev.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the origin trial, we are defaulting to supporting all sites that already contain ads to determine what FLoC a profile is assigned to,&#8221; its spokesman told us when we asked why it&#8217;s auto-enrolling sites. &#8220;Once FLoC’s final proposal is implemented, we expect the FLoC calculation will only draw on sites that opt into participating.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also specified that any user who has blocked third-party cookies won&#8217;t be included in the Origin Trial &#8212; so the trial is not a full &#8216;free-for-all&#8217;, even in the US.</p>
<p>There are reasons for Google to tread carefully. Its Privacy Sandbox tests were quickly shown to be leaking data about incognito browsing mode &#8212; revealing a piece of information that could be used to aid user fingerprinting. Which obviously isn&#8217;t good for privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If FloC is unavailable in incognito mode by design then this allows the detection of users browsing in private browsing mode,&#8221; wrote security and privacy researcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, in an <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-analysis-of-googles-privacy-sandbox-federated-learning-of-cohorts-leaking-information-about-browsing-in-incognito-mode/">initial privacy analysis of the Sandbox</a> this month in which he discussed the implications of the bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;While indeed, the private data about the FloC ID is not provided (and for a good reason), this is still an information leak,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Apparently it is a design bug because the behavior <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc/blob/main/security-and-privacy-self-review.md">seems to be </a>foreseen to the feature authors. It allows differentiating between incognito and normal web browsing modes. Such behavior should be avoided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox tests automating a new form of browser fingerprinting is not &#8216;on message&#8217; with the claimed boost for user privacy. But Google is presumably hoping to iron out such problems via testing and as development of the system continues.</p>
<p>(Indeed, Google&#8217;s spokesman also told us that &#8220;countering fingerprinting is an important goal of the Privacy Sandbox&#8221;, adding: &#8220;The group is developing technology to protect people from opaque or hidden techniques that share data about individual users and allow individuals to be tracked in a covert manner. One of these techniques, for example, involves using a device’s IP address to try and identify someone without their knowledge or ability to opt out.&#8221;)</p>
<p>At the same time it&#8217;s not clear whether or not Google needs to obtain user consent to run the tests legally in Europe. Other legal bases do exist &#8212; although it would take careful legal analysis to ascertain whether or not they could be used. But it&#8217;s certainly interesting that Google has decided it doesn&#8217;t want to risk testing if it can legally trial this tech in Europe without consent.</p>
<p>Likely relevant is the fact that the ePrivacy Directive is not like the harmonized GDPR &#8212; which funnels cross border complaints via a lead data supervisor, shrinking regulatory exposure at least in the first instance.</p>
<p>Any EU DPA may have competence to investigate matters related to ePrivacy in their national markets. To wit: At the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">end of last year</a> France&#8217;s CNIL skewered Google with a $120M fine related to dropping tracking cookies without consent &#8212; underlining the risks of getting EU law on consent wrong. And a privacy-related fine for Privacy Sandbox would be terrible PR. So Google may have calculated it&#8217;s simply less risky to wait.</p>
<p>Under EU law, certain types of personal data are also considered highly sensitive (aka &#8216;special category data&#8217;) and require an even higher bar of explicit consent to process. Such data couldn&#8217;t be bundled into a site-level consent &#8212; but would require specific consent for each instance. So, in other words, there would be even more friction involved in testing with such data.</p>
<p>That may explain why Google plans to do regional testing later &#8212; if it can figure out how to avoid processing such sensitive data. (Relevant: <a href="https://twitter.com/lukolejnik/status/1374403203039555586">Analysis</a> of Google&#8217;s proposal suggests the final version intends to avoid processing sensitive data in the computation of the FLoC ID &#8212; to avoid exactly that scenario.)</p>
<p>If/when Google does implement Privacy Sandbox tests in Europe &#8220;later&#8221;, as it has said it will (having also professed itself &#8220;100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe&#8221;), it will presumably do so when it has added the aforementioned controls to Chrome &#8212; meaning it would be in a position to offer some kind of prompt asking users if they wish to turn the tech off (or, better still, on).</p>
<p>Though, again, it&#8217;s not clear how exactly this will be implemented &#8212; and whether a consent flow will be part of the tests.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google has also not provided a timeline for when tests will start in Europe. Nor would it specify the other countries it&#8217;s running tests in beside the US when we asked about that.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it had not responded to a number of follow up questions either but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get more detail.</p>
<p>The (current) lack of regional tests raises questions about the suitability of Privacy Sandbox for European users &#8212; as the New York Times&#8217; Robin Berjon has pointed out, noting <a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1374399491843887107">via Twitter</a> that &#8220;the market works differently&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not doing origin tests is already a problem&#8230; but not even knowing if it could eventually have a legal basis on which to run seems like a strange position to take?&#8221; he also wrote.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google is surely going to need to test FLoCs in Europe at some point. Because the alternative &#8212; implementing regionally untested adtech &#8212; is unlikely to be a strong sell to advertisers who are already crying foul over Privacy Sandbox on competition and revenue risk grounds.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), meanwhile &#8212; which, under GDPR, is Google&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the region &#8212; confirmed to us that Google has been consulting with it about the Privacy Sandbox plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has been consulting the DPC on this matter and we were aware of the roll-out of the trial,&#8221; deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us today. &#8220;As you are aware, this has not yet been rolled-out in the EU/EEA. If, and when, Google present us with detail plans, outlining their intention to start using this technology within the EU/EEA, we will examine all of the issues further at that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPC has a number of investigations into Google&#8217;s business triggered by GDPR complaints &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">May 2019</a> probe into its adtech and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">February 2020</a> investigation into its processing of users&#8217; location data &#8212; all of which<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are ongoing.</span></p>
<p>But &#8212; in one legacy example of the risks of getting EU data protection compliance wrong &#8212; Google was fined $57M by France&#8217;s CNIL back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">January 2019</a> (under GDPR as its EU users hadn&#8217;t yet come under the jurisdiction of Ireland&#8217;s DPC) for, in that case, not making it clear enough to Android users how it processes their personal information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aspiration.com">Aspiration</a>, the financial services business for socially conscious consumers, is back with another environmentally friendly offering for its customers &#8212; this time, <a href="https://www.aspiration.com/zero">it&#8217;s a credit card</a>.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company, which has raised roughly $250 million from investors including the celebrities Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s Footprint Coalition, and Orlando Bloom and more traditional institutional investors like AlphaEdison, Capricorn Investment Group, the Omidyar Network, and Allen &amp; Co., wouldn&#8217;t say how much about the terms of the card or the credit limits available.</p>
<p>What Aspiration co-founder Andrei Cherny did discuss was the company&#8217;s sense of the significance of its new offering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are plenty of credit cards out there that let you rack up miles, this is the only card that rewards you for taking miles off of the planet,” <span class="il">Aspiration</span> co-founder and CEO Andrei Cherny said in a statement. “For the first time, you can have a climate change-fighting tool right in your wallet.” <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The key to Aspiration&#8217;s offset services is nothing more or less than tree planting. It&#8217;s the easiest way for consumers to eventually cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions associated with daily living in the U.S.</p>
<p>Every time someone uses the card, Aspiration will have one of its global reforestation partners plant a tree. If a customer uses Aspiration&#8217;s credit card 60 times, the resulting trees that are planted are enough to offset the carbon emissions from an average American home</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we’re doing is basing it on the average American’s carbon footprint,&#8221; Cherny affirmed. &#8220;Every time you make a purchase Aspiration plants your tree. The way the math works out. The average carbon impact of the average tree when you have 60 of them you eliminate the emissions from an average American home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Using Aspiration&#8217;s app, which includes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/"> other tools for consumers to gauge the social impact of their purchases</a>, credit card customers can track their progress towards offsetting their emissions. For every month in which a user gets to carbon zero, Aspiration will reward them with 1% cashback on their credit card purchases.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gEmSroXq6V"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/">Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Cherny said the company works with accredited partners and uses satellite imaging and on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the forestation projects are proceeding according to plan and that the trees aren&#8217;t being harvested.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t just doing this out of a sense of corporate responsibility there&#8217;s actually an arbitrage case where the planting of seeds becomes a profit center (however nominal) for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we get to scale that will be the case,&#8221; Cherny said. &#8220;We are not a nonprofit, we&#8217;re a for-profit company dedicated to saving the planet. Until people can make a profit off of saving the planet in the same way people have been profiting on destroying the planet, there are going to continue to be problems&#8230; If only oil companies and incumbent banks can make money by destroying the planet, then we&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lidar companies across the planet are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/the-station-the-lidar-spac-craze-and-10-investors-give-their-mobility-predictions/"> going SPAC</a>, but Baraja isn&#8217;t in a hurry to go public. The Australian lidar maker has raised a $31M B round to continue the deployment and development of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">&#8220;unique and ingenious&#8221;</a> imaging system, with participation beyond the usual VC suspects.</p>
<p>Baraja&#8217;s lidar uses what the company calls SpectrumScan, letting physics do the hard work of directing the light. By passing its laser through a prism, different wavelengths of light go in different directions — and when it comes back, it takes the same path. Actually it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than that, but if you&#8217;re curious check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">my article from CES last year</a>, which lays it out in more detail.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t been lying still since then, even though the most obvious application of lidar — autonomous vehicles — hasn&#8217;t exactly taken off in the meantime. As co-founder and CEO Federico Collarte told me back in 2020 of the lidar industry, &#8220;if you don’t differentiate, you die.&#8221; And Baraja has done so not just with its tech but its approach to the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lidar, it turns out, is actually useful in a lot of industries, but most lidar units contain highly complex mechanical elements that can be affected by heat, cold, and other environmental factors. Not so much Baraja, which has only one moving part (and that very slowly and steadily, somewhere in the optics) and can withstand intense conditions for a long time.</p>
<p>Collarte explained that one of their big customers over the last two years has been the mining industry, and you can imagine why. Creating accurate 3D images of mines is a task that&#8217;s incredibly difficult for humans or ordinary cameras, but practically purpose-built for lidar. That is, if the lidar can withstand the heat, cold, and forces found in mining operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;In mining, the key is reliability and ruggedization,&#8221; Collarte said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had units in mines in the Australian desert for two years. We had one back for RMA — you saw that our units are painted kind of an electric blue — the paint was totally eroded. It was bare metal, but the thing was still working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the more sensitive bits, the laser and receiver, can be hidden deep in the body of the machine and connected via fiber optic to the &#8220;dumb&#8221; lens and prism elements of the head, the device was able to survive years of scorching sands. Not a claim many lidar makers can make!</p>
<p>The partnership with Hitachi Construction Machinery was successful enough that the company decided to invest.</p>
<p>This strategic investment is part of Collarte&#8217;s plan to diversify its financial backing. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to bring in the type of investors who have a very long timeline — institutional investors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Though venture capital is still part of it, he pointed to new investor HESTA, something like a pension fund, as an example of the kind of backer he was looking for in addition to VCs. That said, previous investors Blackbird Ventures (which led) and Main Sequence Ventures returned for this round as well as some new VCs. The $40M Australian amounts to $31M U.S. — slightly less than its $32M U.S. round A in 2018, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like a down round.</p>

<p>Collarte emphasized the importance of operating as a business and not just as an extended R&amp;D process.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re working just on technology, that&#8217;s fine, but you won&#8217;t have sales and customers today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have revenue and real world applications — we&#8217;re exercising those muscles. We&#8217;re getting good at customer support, installation, warranty, failure modes — it&#8217;s a whole area of the company that needs to be exercised over and above pure R&amp;D.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to mining, shipping is another area where lidar can be exposed to punishing conditions, he noted, saying that a major Australian port was using Baraja units as part of its push towards autonomy.</p>
<p>But R&amp;D is still a huge part of the company&#8217;s plans for the funding. The biggest changes are, in the short term, offering an integrated &#8220;one-box&#8221; system that some vehicle makers and suppliers may find simpler to work with. And in the long term the fundamental architecture of the system will evolve as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from a background in telecom, and they&#8217;ve moved from bulk optics [meaning lenses, prisms, and fiber optic bundles] into photonics and integrated circuits. So we&#8217;ve always had that in mind,&#8221; said CTO and co-founder Cibby Pulikkaseril. &#8220;My roadmap is to get these onto chips so that it doesn&#8217;t look any different from any other chips in the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932998" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Collarte pointed out that while miniaturization is difficult for everyone, it&#8217;s especially hard for the scanning mechanism in lidar, which often must be of a certain size and cover a certain arc in order to direct the laser properly. He proudly said they are already well on their way to a solution that is unique to their SpectrumScan method.</p>
<p>The next year, they asserted, will be a major one for Tier 1 suppliers and others racing to level 4 autonomy. Perhaps that&#8217;s why so many lidar companies opted to go public via SPAC in the last one. But that&#8217;s not the plan for Baraja, at least for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re keeping an eye on,&#8221; said Collarte. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not in a rush.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the VCs mentioned above and Hitachi Construction Machinery, the following investors joined the round: Regal Funds Management, Perennial Value Management, and InterValley Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pacaso.com/">Pacaso</a>, a less-than-one-year-old startup that is out to give more people a chance at second home ownership, announced Wednesday that it has received $75 million in growth funding at a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Greycroft and Global Founders Capital co-led the $75 million in equity financing, which is notable for a few reasons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For one, the team. Former Zillow executives Austin Allison and (CEO and co-founder) Spencer Rascoff came up with the concept of Pacaso after leaving Zillow together about 18 months ago. (Publicly traded Zillow today has a market cap of $32.9 billion.) The company gives people the ability to purchase shares in, and become co-owners of, a second home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“We realized that owning a second home had been a very impactful luxury in both of our lives. We&#8217;re both fortunate enough to have second homes, and it made a huge difference to us and our friends and family,” Rascoff said. “What we set out to do was to try to democratize access to second homeownership so that it can be something that is not just a luxury available to the 1%, but hopefully it can be available to many tens of millions of other people around the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something else that stands out about this raise is that Pacaso, which just launched in October 2020, has achieved unicorn status faster than any other company, according to an internal company analysis of Crunchbase data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O4DEbZxoVs"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future/">9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future/embed/#?secret=O4DEbZxoVs" data-secret="O4DEbZxoVs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Pacaso is growing incredibly quickly, faster than anything I&#8217;ve never been a part of,” Rascoff told TechCrunch. “And the reason that it&#8217;s growing so quickly is because consumers love the concept, and they love the idea of being able to own a second home at a much less expensive price metric.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the equity financing announced today, San Francisco-based Pacaso has also secured $1 billion in debt financing. At the time of its launch last fall, the startup had raised $17 million in a Series A led by Maveron, as well as $250 million in debt financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sukhinder Singh Cassidy and Theresia Gouw of the Acrew Diversify Capital Fund; First American Financial; Shea Ventures; Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer; and other notable angel investors also participated in the latest financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With a unique co-ownership model made possible via the creation of a property-specific LLC, the company aims to reduce the cost and hassle of second home ownership. It also gives vacation homeowners an alternative option to renting out their property.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pacaso distinguishes its model from the age-old concept of timeshares, which sell the right to use a fixed amount of time in a condo or hotel. Pacaso aims to bring together a small group of co-owners to purchase a share of a single-family home and &#8220;enjoy ongoing access throughout the year.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is that Pacaso purchases a home either outright or shares in a home. The company then partners with local real estate agents to market the properties. It then sells shares in the home &#8212; from one-eighth of the home to a greater percentage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pacaso holds a brokerage license in more than a dozen top second home markets such as Napa, Lake Tahoe, Palm Springs, Malibu and Park City. Buyers can view curated listings on the startup’s website, which includes active listings, as well as previews of homes under consideration for purchase based on buyer demand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to curating the listings, Pacaso also offers integrated financing, “upscale” interior design, professional property management and proprietary scheduling technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129382" style="width: 642px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129382" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2129382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="632" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pacaso</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Since launch, Pacaso says that more than 500,000 people have visited the website and 60,000 “aspiring buyers” have engaged Pacaso to learn more about second home co-ownership. So far, the company has helped about 100 families become co-owners of second homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Allison estimates that there are about 100 million second homes around the world, with the vast majority of those vacant 10 to 11 months a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“On a monthly basis, that number is growing very quickly,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new markets &#8212; moving from the west coast to the east coast. It eventually plans to also expand globally &#8212; in Europe and potentially in Mexico and the Caribbean. The debt will go toward purchasing shares of more homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There are many tens of millions of families who make enough money to where they have some discretionary income and about 75% of them are dreaming about owning a second home,” he said. “But they are either held back by cost or the inability to justify such a purchase. So there’s this massive problem and what we’ve come up with is a really innovative solution, which is co-ownership.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, the company hopes to offer homes in a broader price range, including homes with lower price tags, noted Allison.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Greycroft co-founder and partner Dana Settle described Pacaso’s business vitals as “nothing short of momentous.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Pacaso is creating a new category that will dramatically change how people approach buying and owning a second home,” she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As most venture firms are, Greycroft was also attracted to the caliber of Pacaso’s founding team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a team that knows this market incredibly well and have worked together previously,” Settle told TechCrunch. “When you see how quickly they&#8217;ve gotten up and running it’s literally a testament to that point.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also likened the company to Uber and Airbnb, which also took otherwise underutilized assets and turned them into a business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is another opportunity to do that &#8212; leveraging technology to create more accessibility in a market,” Settle said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To support its expansion, Pacaso has hired Nina Tran to serve as its chief financial officer. Tran took Waypoint Homes public through its merger with Starwood Waypoint and served as its CFO through its sale to Invitation Homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rascoff has certainly been busy as of late. He&#8217;s also heading up Supernova Partners Acquisition Company, which recently announced it was merging with Offerpad to take that company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/real-estate-tech-startup-offerpad-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-3b-deal/">public</a>. Rascoff is also an investor in Doma, formerly called States Title &#8212; another proptech that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/proptech-startup-states-title-now-doma-going-public-via-spac-in-3b-deal/">going public</a> via a SPAC merger. He&#8217;s also backed a number of startups, including Cheese, a fintech that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/">recently launched</a> a digital banking platform that is aimed at primarily serving the Asian-American community, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp&#8217;s planned policy changes aren&#8217;t sailing smoothly in India, the instant messaging service&#8217;s biggest market by users. Indian antitrust body, Competition Commission of India, on Wednesday <a href="https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/SM01of2021_0.pdf">ordered</a> (PDF) an investigation into WhatsApp&#8217;s privacy policy changes, saying that Facebook-owned service breached local antitrust laws in the guise of a policy update.</p>
<p>WhatsApp didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Indian watchdog has ordered nation&#8217;s Director General (DG) to investigate WhatsApp&#8217;s new policy to &#8220;ascertain the full extent, scope and impact of data sharing through involuntary consent of users.&#8221; The Director General has been ordered to complete the investigation and submit the report within 60 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its order, the Indian watchdog said WhatsApp&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/">take-it-or-leave-it</a>&#8221; nature of privacy policy and terms of service &#8220;merit a detailed investigation in view of the market position and market power enjoyed by WhatsApp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the pronounced network effects it enjoys, and the absence of any credible competitor in the instant messaging market in India, WhatsApp appears to be in a position to compromise quality in terms of protection of individualised data and can deem it unnecessary to even retain the user-friendly alternatives such as ‘opt-out’ choices, without the fear of erosion of its user base. Moreover, the users who do not wish to continue with WhatsApp may have to lose their historical data as porting such data from WhatsApp to other competing apps is not only a cumbersome and time consuming process but, as already explained, network effects make it difficult for the users to switch apps. This would enhance and accentuate switching costs for the users who may want to shift to alternatives due to the policy changes,&#8221; the order reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per the 2021 update to the privacy policy, a business may give third-party service provider such as Facebook access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. It may be possible that Facebook will condition provision of such services to businesses with a requirement for using the data collected by them. The DG may also investigate these aspects during its investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move on Wednesday follows months long legal battle WhatsApp has been fighting in India over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">new policy update</a>, which goes into effect in May this year. Last week, the Indian government alleged that WhatsApp’s planned privacy update <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">violates local laws on several counts</a>. In a filing to the Delhi High Court, the federal government also asked the court to prevent WhatsApp from rolling out the update in India.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, India’s IT ministry had written to Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, to express its “grave concerns” about the update and its implications and had “called upon to withdraw the proposed changes.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp has been working with New Delhi to allay its concerns since early this year. But it doesn&#8217;t seem that India is buying Facebook&#8217;s explanation. The Indian watchdog in its strongly-worded order said, &#8220;Facebook is a direct and immediate beneficiary of the new updates and in these circumstances, it is egregious that Facebook is feigning ignorance about the potential impact of the updates altogether and avoiding from providing its perspective thereon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Used by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">over 2 billion users</a>, WhatsApp has been sharing some information with parent firm Facebook since 2016. The company, which hasn’t substantially updated its terms of service since, said last year that it will be making some changes to share a set of personal data of users &#8212; such as their phone number and location &#8212; with Facebook.</p>
<p>Through an in-app alert earlier this year, WhatsApp asked users to share their consent for the new terms in January, which prompted an immediate backlash from some users. Following the backlash — which saw tens of millions of users explore competing services such as Signal and Telegram — WhatsApp said it will give users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">three additional months to review its new policy</a>.</p>
<p>With over 450 million monthly active users, India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and also for its parent firm Facebook. The social juggernaut has doubled down on its bet to turn India into a key market in recent years. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms</a>, the largest telecom operator in India, last year. The Indian firm is run by Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has added yet more Starlink satellites to its existing constellation on orbit, with a successful delivery of 60 spacecraft this morning from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The mission used a Falcon 9 with a flight-prove booster that served on five previous launches, and a cargo fairing cover made up of two re-used halves from past flights.</p>
<p>This is the fourth Starlink launch in under a month, with prior batches of 60 sent up on March 14, March 11 and March 4, respectively. In total, that means it&#8217;s sent up 240 satellites in about three weeks, which is actually around on par with the number satellites than the second-largest commercial constellation operator, Planet, has in space in total.</p>
<p>The stated goal for SpaceX is to have launched 1,500 Starlink satellites in 2020, and given its progress, it looks on track to make that target at the current launch pace. Starlink should eventually grow to include as many as 10,000 or more active satellites in low-Earth orbit, but the near-term goal is to continue expanding geographic coverage of its broadband internet service to additional countries and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Right now, it seems like the beta service rollout is more hardware-constrained on the ground component side, since SpaceX opened up pre-orders to anyone in a geography it services earlier this year. Customers signing up now for the Starlink antenna and modem kit are getting delivery times that extend out to the end of this year, even in areas where service is known to be available and performing well for existing beta users.</p>
<p>Starlink could become a massive revenue driver for SpaceX once it&#8217;s fully operational, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said the plan is to eventually spin the company out once it&#8217;s past the initial infrastructure investment phase and revenues have stabilized. So far, customer seem to be having a positive experience with the network in terms of speed and reliability relative to other rural broadband solutions, but the next big test will come once the network is experience heavy load in terms of customer volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Denmark-based <a href="https://www.motosumo.com">Motosumo</a> has scored a $6M Series A raise led by London&#8217;s Magenta Partners, alongside existing investors. The new funding will go on doubling its network of spin class instructors across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, expanding its tech team and upping its marketing.</p>
<p>The 2015-founded fit-tech startup has developed a system for measuring cycling cadence without additional sensors &#8212; users need only affix their existing smartphone or tablet to a stationary exercise bike to get real-time feedback on their performance. No expensive Peloton-style connected bike required&#8230; Just strap on your smartphone and pedal away on that ancient exercise bike you found gathering dust in the loft.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s focus to-date has been more on the b2b side &#8212; selling its software to fitness instructors and gyms hosting spin classes who are looking to upgrade the experience with real-time tracking. But it&#8217;s now set to ramp up it b2c business, seizing the opportunity to build at home fitness business as the coronavirus pandemic continues to make life challenging for traditional gyms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’ve recently made the move to our B2C offering (Motosumo),&#8221; CEO Kresten Juel Jensen tells TechCrunch. &#8220;On the B2B side (Momentum), we have over 2,500 users and, over the last year, we passed 100,000 downloads. As we launch the B2C version with Motosumo, we are making an upfront investment in attracting users to become active members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The B2C marketing is just kicking in now and the performance with our early members is very positive over the past few months with an average session rating of 4.9 out of 5. We expect our Motosumo member base will grow very quickly from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Motosumo applies its mobile-based quantification tech &#8212; which measures cadence, speed, distance and calorie burn &#8212; in a cycling training app that also offers interactive 3D games, team challenges and international leaderboards to up the motivational energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our movement technology is a unique enabler for Motosumo –- we empower any bike owner with the ability to get on the leaderboard, join competitions, and get feedback from our instructors,&#8221; says Jensen. &#8220;We process signals from accelerometers and gyroscopes inside smartphones or tablets to calculate your regular cycling performance metrics such as cadence (repetitions-per-minute), calories, and distance. We are not relying on any proprietary hardware, bike sensors, or heart rate monitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of these sensors can be connected for additional data, if desired by the user but it is not required. Even users with 20 year-old spin bikes with no sensors whatsoever can participate, climb the leaderboard, and race with our community. Motosumo algorithms are proprietary and trained by a machine learning loop. This has taken years to reach the accuracy, which is similar to built-in bike sensors, and this will remain a massive barrier to entry for competitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Motosumo combines proprietary tracking tech with a platform that streams a schedule of live spinning classes hosted by a global network of fitness instructors. Pricing starts at (an equally Peloton-undercutting) $13 per month for unlimited access to its content.</p>
<p>Aside from (relative) affordability for its fit tech, it points to interactivity as a differentiator vs other offerings, touting zero delay in the livestream of classes which it says allows its instructors to give genuinely real-time feedback. Currently it has five coaches active on its platform. Another five will be onboarded over the next six weeks, per Jensen</p>
<p>&#8220;The Motosumo live fitness experience makes a big difference,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;With the live experience, our coaches personalize the workout, the sense of community is stronger, and the experience is more interactive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Motosumo offers more than 40 live workouts per week which we will grow along with our new coaches and members. On many other platforms, the live experience means 15-60 second buffered streams. We have worked relentlessly to reduce our delay to 0.5 seconds. We made that investment to provide the real studio experience, where instructors react to numbers, emojis, or whatever happens right in the moment. It&#8217;s not just greetings for anniversary ride celebrations. It&#8217;s the true studio live experience we are on a mission to deliver in all aspects.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla made headlines earlier this year when it took out significant holdings in bitcoin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">acquiring a roughly $1.5 billion stake at then-prices in early February</a>. At the time, it also noted in an SEC filing disclosing the transaction that it could also eventually accept the cryptocurrency as payment from customers for its vehicles. Now, Elon Musk says they&#8217;ve made that a reality, at least for customers in the U.S., and he added that the plan is for the automaker to &#8216;hodl&#8217; all their bitcoin payments, too.</p>
<p>In terms of its infrastructure for accepting bitcoin payments, Tesla isn&#8217;t relying on any third-party networks or wallets — the company is &#8220;using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,&#8221; Musk said on Twitter. And when customers pay in bitcoin, those won&#8217;t be converted to fiat currency, the CEO says, but will instead presumably add to the company&#8217;s stockpile.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In February when Tesla revealed its bitcoin purchase, observers either <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/teslas-bitcoin-investment-could-be-bad-for-the-companys-climate-reputation-and-its-bottom-line/">lauded the company&#8217;s novel approach to converting its cash holdings, or criticized the plan for its attachment to an asset with significant price volatility</a>. Many also pointed out that the environmental cost of mining bitcoin seems at odds with Tesla&#8217;s overall stated mission, given its carbon footprint. Commenters today echoed these concerns, noting the irony of Tesla accepting the grid-taxing cryptocurrency for its all-electric cars.</p>
<p>As for how the bitcoin payment process works today, Tesla has detailed that in an FAQ. Customers begin the payment process from their own bitcoin wallet, and have to set the exact amount for a vehicle deposit based on current rates, with the value of Tesla&#8217;s cars still set in U.S. dollars. The automaker further notes that in the case of any refunds, it&#8217;s buyer-beware in terms of any change in value relative to the U.S. dollar from time of purchase to time of refund.</p>
<p>Musk also said that the plan is to expand Bitcoin payments to other countries outside the U.S. by &#8220;later this year.&#8221; Depending on the market, that could require some regulatory work, but clearly Musk thinks it&#8217;s worth the effort. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up slightly on the news early Wednesday morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the Ubers of the world continue to scale, a smaller on-demand transportation startup has raised some funding in Germany, underscoring the opportunities that remain for startups in the space targeting specific service niches. <a href="http://blacklane.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blacklane</a> &#8212; the Berlin startup that provides on-demand black-car chauffeur services in Berlin, London, Dubai, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Singapore and 16 other cities &#8212; has closed a round of €22 million ($26 million at current rates). After taking a majority stake in Havn, the Jaguar-hatched electric car service in London, in February, Blacklane said that it will be using this latest round of funding to continue expanding sustainable travel initiatives, and to continue expanding its existing business with more flexible options for riding.</p>
<p>The funding, which is being made at an upround valuation, is a sign of how the company is showing signs of growth after a year in which monthly revenues dropped 99% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting drop in travel, and specifically people willing to be in small spaces that are shared with others.</p>
<p>“The global travel and mobility industries have suffered, with several players struggling between drastic cuts, hibernation or ceasing operations. Blacklane has taken the opportunity to cater to travelers’ emerging needs,” said Dr. Jens Wohltorf, CEO and co-founder of Blacklane, in a statement. “Thanks to this financing, we will continue to fast-track our innovation, with zero layoffs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said that the investment is coming from existing investors German automotive giant Daimler, the UAE&#8217;s ALFAHIM Group and btov Partners. And while it is coming at an upround, Blacklane is not disclosing any figures, nor has it ever disclosed valuation. Previous backers of the company also include the strategic investment arm of Recruit Holdings, the Japanese HR giant, and it has raised around $100 million to date, including a round of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/blacklane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about $45 million in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The funding is coming after what has been an extremely rough year for travel and transportation startups due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with Blacklane itself seeing monthly revenues drop 99% after the pandemic hit last year, the company tells me.</p>
<p>Some others in the space that diversified into other areas like food delivery or other kinds of transport (eg, bikes or scooters) were able to offset declines in their more core ride-hailing services, which in the meantime were repositioned as a safer alternative to public transportation. Blacklane, however, had never positioned itself as a ride for &#8220;everyman&#8221; &#8212; its core use case were higher-end rides and airport trips (which had also died a death) &#8212; so when movement shut down, so Blacklane&#8217;s business nosedived.</p>
<p>It was particularly bad timing for Blacklane, considering that in the lead up to the pandemic, it looked to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/blacklane-is-on-the-road-to-building-a-profitable-on-demand-transportation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on course to turn a profit on its focused model</a>. (While financials for 2020 will take a while to be posted, the most recent results for the company showed a net loss of about $18 million in 2018.)</p>
<p>The reason that Blacklane has managed to raise at an upround tells another side of the story, however.</p>
<p>As companies in transport and travel gingerly started to show the smaller signs of recovery last summer, so too did Blacklane. It coupled that with the first steps of diversification itself.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it added &#8220;chauffeur hailing&#8221; in 22 cities, an on-demand service that reduced the lead time for an order to under 30 minutes (its previous service was based on more advanced bookings). It also changed its pricing structure to get more competitive on shorter distances, since so many of the airport rides that were the basis of its revenues have yet to return.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Blacklane <a href="https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2021/02/blacklane-invests-havn-londons-premium-all-electric-chauffeur-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a majority stake in Havn</a>, an electric-based car service hatched by Jaguar, for an undisclosed sum, to spearhead a move into more sustainable travel options alongside the fleet of Teslas already operated by Blacklane.</p>
<p>“Worldwide travel restrictions give us a one-time chance to reset our expectations for safe and sustainable trips,” said Wohltorf in a statement. “Blacklane will recover responsibly and continue to grow while caring for both people and the planet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian travel startup Hopper has raised a $170 million Series F round, led by Capital One. The U.S. banks and credit card company is also coming on board as a strategic partner, to launch Capital One Travel, which is the first instantiation of Hopper&#8217;s new B2B platform, Hopper Cloud.</p>
<p>This is Hopper&#8217;s second raise in a year that has been marked by turmoil for the travel industry, owing to the disruptions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Last March, Hopper raised $70 million, in a round that saw Inovia Capital actually make its first investment in the startup — essentially at the very moment that things looked most bleak for the travel industry in general, and in particular for airfare-focused Hopper.</p>
<p>I asked Inovia partner Patrick Pichette about his decision to back Hopper at a moment when a lot of investors where essentially on pause pending the fallout of the just-declared pandemic, and about their renewed support with a contribution to this latest round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we had seen in the prior six months, nine months ti a year at Hopper was a transformation of a company before COVID,&#8221; Pichette said. &#8220;And second is our thesis at Inovia — we invest in companies with the mindset of, &#8216;Does this company have a shot at being a global company?&#8217; If it&#8217;s gonna be a Canadian company, it might be fine, but it&#8217;s just not for us. Also, does it really leverage tech in a way that is differentiated? And so if it has these attributes, then we&#8217;re interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>That pre-COVID transformation that Pichette is referring to is Hopper&#8217;s shift from being essentially a machine learning-powered lowest fare finder, to what co-founder and CEO Fred Lalonde says is really much more of a fintech company. That characterization mostly comes from Hopper&#8217;s ability to offer customers financial flexibility around their travel bookings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real fundamental sea change is that Hopper moved away from being a predominantly air travel company to a true fintech,&#8221; Lalonde explained in an interview. &#8220;Price freeze is a good example. We allow you to come in and hold the price of a booking for between two hours and 14 days. If the price goes up you pay what you froze, and if it goes down and you pay the lower price. We have flexible date plans, cancellation plans, where you can take a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket and for a nominal fee, make it changeable. And one that&#8217;s working really surprisingly well is the disruption insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopper&#8217;s disruption insurance is basically a rebooking service for missed connections. Whatever the reason, if you happen to miss a connection on a multiple-leg flight and you have opted for the disruption insurance service, you&#8217;ll be presented with every flight leaving that particular airport, regardless of airline, to your destination and you can select an available option at no additional cost.</p>
<p>Understandably, Hopper&#8217;s overall business took a hit during the pandemic, and that had a steep cost: The company laid off around 45% of its staff last year as a result of the dip in demand. But for the bookings that were being made, Lalonde says the company was seeing very high attach rates for its products that provide more peace-of-mind around booking stability. Now, with the U.S. travel industry in particular taking its first steps towards recovery, Lalonde says behavior is not changing as much as his company had anticipated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129544" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129544" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2129544" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1920x1080_iOS_Home_Flights-Core.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2129544" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hopper</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What is interesting is as demand has recovered, originally we thought since we had very, very high attach rates, we thought those would never come back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve actually outgrown our pandemic attach rate. So people are adding more of these services, and we credit that to the product innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lalonde also credits the pandemic for proving out the validity of its fintech approach, since Hopper &#8220;had a lot of liabilities&#8221; in place prior to the global shutdowns, and so a lot of investors and observers were watching and thinking that though this was a novel and interesting approach, carrying those liabilities appeared to incur a lot of additional risk, as well. The pandemic was &#8220;the mother of all black swan events,&#8221; however, he notes, which means that now, it doesn&#8217;t have to talk about the theoretical resilience of its model — it can point to the actual experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three months later, [it turns out] we lost money for about 30 days,&#8221; Lalonde said. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re back on the other side of this, every color is profitable. The fact is the way that the future travel credits kicked in, and how the refunding work, we ended up with a pretty stable revenue stream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopper customers may not have felt so optimistic about the company&#8217;s performance during the pandemic, however. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unicorn-travel-startup-hopper-is-facing-a-pandemic-fueled-customer-service-nightmare/">startup&#8217;s app reviews, Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile and social media accounts were inundated with negative comments and reports of poor experiences</a>. Most centered around either a lack of customer ability to secure their refund, or a failure of communication on Hopper&#8217;s part. Lalonde says that Hopper definitely failed at the communication part, and it&#8217;s still in the process of hiring hundreds of additional call center employees to improve that part of the business, but fundamentally, it opted to take a hit on that front in order to focus on building a technical solution to handle the unprecedented volume of flight credits coming from airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The part that is misunderstood is that all of a sudden, the airlines gave out these future travel credits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These vouchers, we had to key them in all by hand. And I swear, this is a green screen – you have to go in and do commands. It takes about 20 minutes to do one, so we counted how much time with all of our staff, it would take us to do them by hand. And the answer was we&#8217;d be done in 2070, and then even if you double the number of people doing it, it was 2050.&#8221;</p>
<p>No existing automation for this process existed because prior to the pandemic, credits for non-refundable airline tickets just didn&#8217;t really exist, and particularly not at scale. At that point, Lalonde says Hopper &#8220;made a decision to put everybody on the automation, [and] just get murdered publicly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He says that gamble has worked out, since once the automation was up and running, they&#8217;ve been able to clear out the backlog pretty much entirely. And the company has also been focused on new product developments, including shifting its roadmap to prioritize the addition of car rental and hotel/holiday home booking to better suit the needs of pandemic travel, which has largely been overland in North America. That has meant deprioritizing other areas, including international expansion, but Lalonde says that&#8217;s one focus for use of the new funds the company raised.</p>
<p>The other big focus is Hopper Cloud, a B2B offering that provides the benefits of Hopper&#8217;s machine-learning power price prediction, as well as its fintech travel insurance and disruption prevention products, but tied to another businesses&#8217; unique offerings. In the case of Capital One, that means all the rewards the company offers its cardholders in terms of earning and redeeming travel credits, for instance. I asked Lalonde whether that approach was made more appealing by the fact that it somewhat intermediates the customer experience, but he pointed out that the initiative is a co-branded one, so Hopper still has its name on the product and the accountability. Plus, he added, the real advantage of these kinds of partnerships are the network effects, and Hopper&#8217;s goal remains becoming the top booking destination for customers directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons I never want to drop the marketplace — it&#8217;s growing really quickly and making money, but even if it didn&#8217;t, losing that would just put us further away from the end customer,&#8221; Lalonde said. &#8220;I like the proximity of knowing exactly what happens, and feeling the pain when we screw up and feeling the joy when we get something right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dream Sports, the parent firm of fantasy sports app Dream11, has secured $400 million in a new financing round as the Mumbai-headquartered firm builds what it calls an “end-to-end sports tech company” in the cricket-loving nation, which is also the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The secondary fundraise was led by TCV, D1 Capital Partners and Falcon Edge. The new round valued the startup at nearly $5 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation/">up from about $2.5 billion in a mix of primary and secondary September round</a> last year.</p>
<p>Existing investors including Tiger Global, ChrysCapital, TPG Growth, Steadview Capital and Footpath Ventures also participated in the round, which brings Dream Sports&#8217; total to-date raise to over $720 million. Avendus Capital was the financial advisor to Dream Sports on the transaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dream11 has cashed in on the popularity of cricket &#8212; a game that has attracted serious attention from several major firms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/hotstar-disneys-indian-streaming-service-sets-new-global-record-for-live-viewership/">including Disney</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/facebook-secures-exclusive-digital-rights-to-stream-icc-global-events-in-indian-sub-continent/">Facebook</a>. Dream11 explores the fantasy part of it, allowing gamers to create virtual teams comprising real-life players and lets them organize matches based on statistical performances of those players in real games. The platform offers fantasy cricket, football, kabaddi and basketball. Users win cash prizes depending on how their selected team performs.</p>
<p>“This is a huge vote of confidence to the Indian startup ecosystem. We have created the Fantasy Sports category in India to drive digital engagement to real-life sporting events and bring fans closer to the sport they love. We are proud to continually contribute to the overall expansion of the Indian sports ecosystem. Our growth trajectory is also a testimony to the honourable Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Digital India,&#8221; said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive of Dream Sports, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, whose Android app is not on the Play Store, said it has over 100 million users. Dream11 was the title sponsor for last year&#8217;s cricket tournament IPL after bidding $30 million for the spot.</p>
<p>“India is home to the world’s largest and most energetic sports fan base with a dynamic mix that is unique to the subcontinent. Dream Sports is serving this community with a highly innovative product offering,” said Gopi Vaddi, General Partner at TCV, in a statement. TCV has also backed Netflix, Airbnb, Sportradar and Peloton.</p>
<p>Dream11 isn’t the only firm building a niche in the fantasy sports space in India. Sequoia Capital India and Times Internet-backed Mobile Premier League is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/indian-mobile-gaming-platform-mobile-premier-league-valued-at-945-million-in-95-million-fundraise/">also a major player</a>, which has expanded to traditional mobile games in recent months. Twitter-backed ShareChat also quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/twitter-backed-sharechat-eyes-fantasy-sports-in-india/">began experimenting with fantasy sports</a> last year.</p>
<p>But fantasy sports is still facing some regulatory hurdles in parts of India. Several Indian states, including Assam, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana, have <a href="https://glaws.in/2019/07/02/overview-of-india-fantasy-sports-industry-its-legality-gst/">banned</a> fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t help matters either that the fantasy sports business’ attempts at legitimacy involve trying to be seen as video games — a cursory glance at a speakers’ panel for any Indian video game developer event is evidence of this — rather than riding on its own merits,” said Rishi Alwani, a long-time analyst of Indian gaming market and editor of <a href="https://in.ign.com">IGN India</a>, in an earlier interview with TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://neighbor.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which operates a self-storage marketplace, announced Wednesday that it has raised $53 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall led the financing, which notably also included participation from returning backer Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and new investors DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and StockX CEO Scott Cutler. Xu and Cutler will join former Uber CEO Ryan Graves as investors and advisors to the Lehi, Utah-based startup. A16z led Neighbor&#8217;s <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/utahs-neighbor-com-raises-10m-in-a16z-led-series-a-to-be-the-airbnb-of-self-storage/">$10 million Series A</a> in January of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when the commercial real estate world is struggling, self-storage is an asset class that continues to perform extremely well. Neighbor’s unique model aims to repurpose under-utilized or vacant space &#8212; whether it be a person’s basement or the empty floor of an office building &#8212; and turn it into storage.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Gardner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joseph Woodbury</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Preston Alder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founded Neighbor.com in 2017 with the mission of giving people a more accessible and personal alternative to store their belongings. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129480" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129480" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2129480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="618" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Neighbor</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $40 billion self-storage industry is ripe for a shake-up, considering that most people are used to renting space out of buildings located in not necessarily convenient locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor has developed a unique peer-to-peer model, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onnecting “renters” in need of storage space with “hosts” in their neighborhood who are willing to lease storage space in their home, garage or even driveway. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hosts on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making more than $50,000 a year in passive income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really grew into a national business over the last year and now have active renters in more states than Public Storage, which is a $43 billion publicly traded company,” CEO Woodbury said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor makes money by charging a service fee (a sliding-scale percentage) of each rent. Its algorithms provide suggested rental fees for hosts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID has only accelerated Neighbor’s business, with revenue growing “5x” and organic reservations increasing “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7x” year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think about it, fundamentally on the demand side, everyone&#8217;s moving out of these major metro areas like New York and San Francisco, and are moving to these more rural locations. All that moving activity has created a lot more storage demand,” Woodbury told TechCrunch. “In addition to that, people are just spending more time at home and cleaning out their homes more. And they no doubt need storage as a result of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also doesn’t hurt that the company claims the self-storage offered on its marketplace </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on average is priced about 40% to 50% less than traditional storage facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor also partners with commercial real estate operators to turn their under-utilized or vacant retail, multifamily or office space into self-storage. This provides new revenue streams to landlords hurting from the pandemic keeping so many people at home. And that increased demand led to Neighbor’s commercial real estate footprint growing 10x in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company plans to expand its nationwide network of hosts and renters as well as continue to spread awareness of its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have tens of millions of square feet of self storage on the platform,” Woodbury said. “The beauty of that square footage is that it&#8217;s in every single state. But we want to continue to expand nationally and as we grow and mature, we’ll turn our eyes globally as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, before leading the round for Neighbor, Fifth Wall approached the company about business development opportunities. Partner Dan Wenhold said he offered to introduce the concept to the real estate venture firm’s LPs, which include more than 65 of the world’s largest owners and operators of real estate from 15 countries. For example, Fifth Wall partners Acadia Realty Trust and Jamestown are already onboarding properties onto Neighbor’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are sort of the bridge between the largest owners and operators of physical real estate assets and the most disruptive technologies that are impacting those property managers and landlords, Wenhold said. “And Neighbor fits perfectly into that thesis for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After introducing Neighbor to a short list of Fifth Wall’s strategic LP partners, the feedback the firm got “was fantastic,” Wenhold said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of owners in retail, office and even multi-family expressed interest in working with Neighbor to help monetize space,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s mission also has a sustainable component considering that creating self-storage space out of existing property can help minimize the amount of new construction that takes place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall, Wenhold added, is aware of the waste and the emissions that come from the construction process to build new space and admires Neighbor’s role in minimizing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our firm ardently pursued the opportunity to invest in a transformative proptech business like Neighbor,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Jumio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/">announcing a $150 million injection</a> this week to continue building out its AI-based ID verification and anti-money laundering platform, another startup in the space is levelling up. <a href="https://feedzai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedzai</a>, which provides banks, others in the financial sector, and any company managing payments online with AI tools to spot and fight fraud &#8212; its cornerstone service involves super quick (3 millisecond) checks happening in the background while transactions are being made &#8212; has announced a Series D of $200 million. It said that the new financing is being made at a valuation of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by KKR, with Sapphire Ventures and strategic backer Citi Ventures &#8212; both past investors &#8212; also participating. Feedzai said it will be using the funds for further R&amp;D and product development, to expand into more markets outside the U.S. &#8212; it was originally founded in Portugal but now is based out of San Mateo &#8212; and towards business development, specifically via partnerships to integrate and sell its tools.</p>
<p>One of those partners looks to be Citi itself:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Citi is committed to advancing global payments anchored on transparency, efficiency, and control, and our partnership with Feedzai is allowing us to provide customers with technology that seamlessly balances agility and security,” said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, with Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, in a statement.</p>
<p>This latest round comes nearly four years after Feedzai raised its Series C, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/feedzai-closes-50m-series-c-to-help-banks-and-merchants-identify-fraud-with-ai/">$50 million round</a> led by an unnamed investor and with an undisclosed valuation. Sapphire also participated in that round. It has now raised some $182 million to date.</p>
<p>Feedzai&#8217;s funding is happening at a time when the need for fraud protection for those managing transactions online has reached a high watermark, leading to a rush of customers for companies in the field.</p>
<p>Feezai says that its customers include 4 of the 5 largest banks in North America, 80% of the world&#8217;s Fortune 500 companies, 154 million individual and business taxpayers in the U.S., and has processed $9 billion in online transactions for 2 of the world’s most valuable athletic brands. In total its reach covers some 800 million customers of businesses that use its services.</p>
<p>In addition to Citibank, its customers include Fiserv, Santander, SoFi, and Standard Chartered&#8217;s Mox.</p>
<p>While money laundering, fraud and other kinds of illicit financial activity were already problems then, in the interim, the problem has only compounded, not least because of how much activity has shifted online, accelerating especially in the last year of pandemic-driven lockdowns. That&#8217;s been exacerbated also by a general rise in cybercrime &#8212; of which financial fraud remains the biggest component and motivator.</p>
<p>Within that bigger trend, solutions based on artificial intelligence have really emerged as critical to the task of identifying and fighting those illicit activities. Not only is that because AI solutions are able to make calculations and take actions and simply process more than non-AI based tools, or humans for that matter, but they are then able to go head to head with much of the fraud taking place, which itself is being built out on AI-based platforms and requires more sophistication to identify and combat.</p>
<p>For banking customers, Feedzai&#8217;s approach has been disruptive in part because of how it has conceived of the problem: it has built solutions that can be used across different scenarios, making them more powerful since the AI system is subsequently &#8220;learning&#8221; from more data. This is in contrast to how many financial service providers had conceived and tackled the issue in the past.</p>
<p>“Until now banks have used solutions based on verticals,” Nuno Sebastiao, co-founder and CEO of Feedzai, said in the past to TechCrunch. &#8220;The fraud solution you have for an ATM wouldn’t be the same fraud solution you would use for online banking which wouldn’t be the same fraud solution would have for a voice call center.” As these companies have refreshed their systems, many have taken a more agnostic approach like the kind the Feedzai has built.</p>
<p>The scale of the issue is clear, and unfortunately also something many of us have experienced first-hand. Feedzai says its data indicates that the last quarter of 2020 that show consumers saw a 650% increase in account takeover scams, a 600% in impersonation scams, and a 250% increase in online banking fraud attacks versus the first quarter of 2020.  (Those periods are, essentially, before pandemic and during pandemic comparisons.)</p>
<p>“The past 12 months have accelerated the world’s dependency on electronic financial services – from online banking to mobile payments, and in turn have increased fraud and money laundering activity. Our services are in more demand than ever,&#8221; said Sebastiao in a statement today.</p>
<p>Indeed, yesterday, when I covered Jumio&#8217;s $150 million round, I said I wouldn&#8217;t consider its funding to be an outlier (even though Jumio made clear it was the largest funding to date in its space): the fast follow from Feedzai, with an even higher amount of financing, really does underscore the trend at the moment.</p>
<p>In addition to these two, one of Feedzai&#8217;s biggest competitors, Kount, was acquired by credit ratings giant <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-kount-301203473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax earlier this year</a> for $640 million to move deeper into the space. (And related to that field, in the area of identity management, which goes hand-in-hand with tools for laundering and fraud, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okta acquired Auth0 for $6.5 billion</a>.)</p>
<p>Other big rounds for startups in the wider space have included included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ForgeRock</a> ($96 million round), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/payfone-raises-100m-for-its-mobile-phone-based-digital-verification-and-id-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payfone</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/complyadvantage-nabs-50m-for-an-ai-platform-and-database-to-detect-and-stop-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComplyAdvantage</a> ($50 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/ripjar-founded-by-gchq-alums-raises-36-8m-for-ai-that-detects-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripjar</a> ($36.8 million) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/identity-management-startup-truework-raises-30m-to-help-you-verify-your-work-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truework</a> ($30 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/zeotap-raises-18-5m-for-a-customer-id-platform-it-says-was-built-with-privacy-in-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeotap</a> ($18 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/persona-raises-17-5m-for-an-identify-verification-platform-the-goes-beyond-user-ids-and-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona</a> ($17.5 million).</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">KKR&#8217;s involvement in this round is notable as another example of a private equity firm getting in earlier with venture rounds with fast-scaling startups, similar to Great Hill&#8217;s investment in Jumio yesterday and a number of other examples. The firm says it&#8217;s making this investment out of its </span>Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II, which is focused on making growth equity investment opportunities in the technology space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feedzai offers a powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we are facing today: financial crime in the digital age. Global commerce depends on future-proof technologies capable of dealing with a rapidly evolving threat landscape. At the same time, consumers rightfully demand a great customer experience, in addition to strong security layers when using banking or payments services,” said Stephen Shanley, Managing Director at KKR, in a statement</p>
<p>“We believe Feedzai’s platform uniquely meets these expectations and more, and we are looking forward to working with Nuno and the rest of the team to expand their offering even further,&#8221; added Spencer Chavez, Principal at KKR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria remains a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cash-dominated country. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 100 million adult Nigerians, of which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half have little or no access to financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://bankly.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup digitizing cash for the unbanked, announced that it has closed a $2 million seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tomilola-adejana-65564532">Tomilola Adejana</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/freddadamz">Fredrick Adams</a> in 2018, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is digitizing the informal thrift collections system known with different names such as <a href="https://www.in-formality.com/wiki/index.php?title=Esusu_(Nigeria)#:~:text=Esusu%20and%20ajo%20describe%20means,This%20may%20take%20several%20forms.&amp;text=In%20the%20literature%20on%20informal,credit%20associations%20(Seibel%202004).">esusu or ajo</a> in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of a banking system nearby or a disregard for one, the unbanked resort to these traditional systems because they work completely offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system allows them to collate and save cash with a thrift collector responsible for disbursing funds when due</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are issues around this system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is the security issues that arise when the thrift collector goes missing with the money or is feared dead, leaving no clue where the savings are kept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also limited access where members cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save if absent from a particular location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third is the lack of customer data since most don&#8217;t have an online banking presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has done is to digitize their whole process of collating money and allow these unbanked people to save using online and offline methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 18 months, the company has been building out its distribution and agent networks. Here, customers can deposit and withdraw cash with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agent anytime. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This solves the issue of access as there are thousands of agents in these cash-dependent communities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the information of this new set of customers is collected and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its platform, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts to build engaging communities where these people can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save their income with the agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online banking presence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most of their money in a bank and little or no cash to buy airtime or make payments, they would frequently opt to access these services online via their mobile phones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129503" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129503" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=768,312 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bankly</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboarding these new set of customers means they get to save and transact more over time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens up access to credit and with more value created, there&#8217;s a new set of banked people, which leads to financial inclusion in the long run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The first phase is building agent networks which is good but that&#8217;s not the goal,&#8221; CEO Adejana said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same way mobile inclusion happened, you need to then focus on acquiring customers who, after transferring cash to their mobile accounts, use it to buy airtime or make payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We call that the three-phase process. The distribution first, then focusing on the consumer, after that full digitization. This is how we reach financial inclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its insights into customer behaviour and transactions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also provides “data-as-a-service” to other service providers to offer tailored products and services to Nigeria’s informal sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operates like a traditional bank but with fewer assets, revenue, customers and operational costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because it doesn&#8217;t spend a lot in acquiring customers and building physical presences, it can pass on those cost savings to customers as interests and still make decent margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents on the platform also take commissions for any transaction a customer makes through them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This time last year, the company had a little over 2,000 agents across the country. Now, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that number has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grown to 15,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company still plans to add more agents with the new investment received. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase its 35,000 customer base in cash-dependent communities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also provide direct-to-consumer products in the coming months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129491" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129491" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bankly-PR-Photo.jpeg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129491" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Fredrick Adams (CPO) and Tomilola Adejana (CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Bankly&#8217;s three years of operation, Adejana cites finding the right partners, talent, and most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right investors as challenges that the company has faced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of Bankly&#8217;s business, Adejana didn&#8217;t accept some of the investments offered to the company and only let in investors who aligned with the company&#8217;s plans for the unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to be patient to make sure that we were talking to people who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understand the problem and are passionate about solving it and are not about getting returns as soon as possible,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These investors include lead Vault, the holding company of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vanso">VANSO</a>, a fintech that was <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2016/02/09/interswitch-acquires-vanso/">sold to Interswitch</a> in 2016, Plug and Play Ventures, Rising Tide Africa and Chrysalis Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given our over twenty years experience in Nigeria’s fintech industry and previous exits, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understands the nuanced needs of this market — not to mention the team, strategy, and technology — to succeed in bringing affordable financial services to the unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this financing round as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moves into its next growth stage,” Idris Alubankudi Saliu, partner at Vault said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to grow its customer base to 2 million unbanked Nigerians over the next three years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to support the Central Bank of Nigeria’s <a href="https://www.proshareng.com/news/Data---Financial-Inclusion/Nigeria%E2%80%99s-Revised-National-Financial-I/43468">National Financial Inclusion Strategy</a> of increasing the number of banked Nigerians from 60% to 80% by 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year on, that strategy is yet to be actualized. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adejana says Bankly is working with these regulators towards a more realistic target of 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to have closed this milestone fundraise and to have such seasoned fintech investors who understand the market join us on this journey to bank Nigeria’s unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we have built the agent network and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via offline and online channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the needs of the unbanked will be vital to our success,” said Adejana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO was an investment banker but it was during her masters&#8217; program in Sydney she got into the world of fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to Nigeria, Adejana worked on a product that offered loans to small businesses, then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later joined <a href="https://www.accion.org/accion-venture-lab-to-invest-at-least-4-5m-in-african-fintechs-with-new-fund">Accion Venture Lab</a>, a program focused on products that foster financial inclusivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was there </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product has caught on well. And while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are lots of fintech products in the Nigerian market pitching to reach the unbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains one of the very few that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">boldly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stake a claim to that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To truly attain financial inclusion in Nigeria, Adejana believes the onus lies with the fintechs to have long-term views </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the telcos and fast-moving customer goods did in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This increases the pie of customers fintechs can serve instead of taking a slice of an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For financial services to reach the last mile, it has to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be distributed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same way fast-moving consumer goods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are distributed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://kitabeli.id/">KitaBeli</a>, an Indonesian social commerce app for group buying, announced today it has raised a $10 million Series A. The round was led by Go Ventures, whose cornerstone investor is Gojek, with participation from returning investors AC Ventures and East Ventures. KitaBeli currently focuses on selling fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in areas outside of Indonesia’s major cities, including to people who have never shopped online before.</p>
<p class="p1">Launched in March 2020 in Jarkata, KitaBeli then entered the cities of Solo and Malang. Its new funding will be used to expand KitaBeli’s operations in Java, growing its logistics network and developing its mobile app. KitaBeli claims it has grown 80% month over month since launch, with a cost-per-install rate of just 10 cents USD per customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Unlike other social e-commerce apps, including ChiliBeli and Woobiz in Indonesia, that build networks of resellers or agents who market items through their social media profiles and take a cut of sales, KitaBeli’s buyers place orders directly through its app, participating in group deals for lower prices. For farmers and suppliers, KitaBeli’s value comes from the ability to reach new customers in more areas of Indonesia. It says users spend an average of USD $70 per month on the app and plans to add new categories like beauty, fashion and accessories.</p>
<p class="p1">Co-founder and chief executive officer Prateek Chaturvedi said KitaBeli focuses on direct relationships with end customers because &#8220;this enables greater customer loyalty and the ability to become the go-to e-commerce platform for new online shoppers. We don’t run the risk of losing our customers if an agent decides to stop working with us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">While it doesn’t have a reseller network, KitaBeli works with delivery partners for last-mile deliveries, presenting the gig as an opportunity to earn extra money. It plans to continue building its delivery network across Indonesia to help KitaBeli solve the challenges of reaching smaller cities and more rural areas.</p>

<p class="p1">An obvious comparison to KitaBeli is Pinduoduo, the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce player that launched in 2015 as a group-buying service for fresh produce, and also focuses on growth in smaller cities.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, &#8220;tier 2-4 cities in Indonesia still lack the digital and logistical infrastructure that similar cities in China have,&#8221; Chaturvedi said. &#8220;Indonesian customers are also new to the internet and need to be educated on how e-commerce works.&#8221; KitaBeli’s app is designed to be approachable for first-time e-commerce shoppers, and only takes 6MB to download, making it more accessible to people who have older smartphone models or slower internet connections.</p>
<p class="p1">KitaBeli will continue focusing on Indonesia instead of expanding into other Southeast Asia countries because &#8220;the Indonesian market is a massive and underpenetrated market,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p class="p1">In a press statement, Go Ventures’ senior vice president of investments Aditya Kumar said, &#8220;E-commerce penetration beyond the large metros has remained low, predominantly because of lack of trust, poor product availability, and high logistics costs. Kitabeli is well positioned to address these challenges through the social nature of its product, accelerating online shopping for a new generation of users and bringing the benefits of e-commerce to a wider population across Indonesia.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime is rolling out several new features, including the ability to rent electric scooters without downloading the app, in an effort to attract more riders. </span></p>
<p>The micromobility company announced Wednesday a series of <span style="font-weight: 400;">product features that aims to remove barriers to entry for new users, while increasing accessibility to its vehicles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new features include free vehicle reservations up to 10 minutes, closest vehicle recommendations and the option to view the app in dark mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app-less experience is already live in more than half of Lime’s 130 markets, where developers have been monitoring and analyzing its usage. This feature is only available on e-scooters. The free vehicle reservations and recommendations features can be used when renting Lime’s e-scooters and e-bikes — and across every market and language, according to Lime developers.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use rider feedback to build out the app or any features associated with it,” senior product manager Vijay Murali told TechCrunch. App store reviews, customer service tickets complaining about a feature or a lack of it, customer surveys and research sessions with riders from around the world all inform the direction developers take with new features. In the case of these latest updates, Murali said the team identified three goals their customers were trying to accomplish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first is that many users are ready to try this new form of transport, but they don’t want to download the app and make the commitment,” said Murali. “The second is a price concern for those who ride with us frequently, and the third is about making it easier, especially in a big city, to find the closest vehicle to you.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129441" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129441" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2129441 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png 570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129441" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lime</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when a customer open the apps, they&#8217;ll be directed towards the nearest vehicle and offered the option of reserving it for free, which Murali said streamlines the process of just jumping on a scooter and helps make riding a daily habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app-less riding feature is geared towards those who are new to micromobility, might not have any space on their phones to download the app or are on an expensive international data plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use the feature, customers need to scanning a QR code with their camera app which connects to Apple’s App Clips or Android’s Instant App features. Customers can then confirm the ride and use Apple Pay or Google Pay to start riding. Technically, users are actually downloading a sliver of the app — only 10 megabytes versus 100 megabytes for the full app, and only for eight hours. To the average rider, it just appears as if they&#8217;re opening a file or app on their phone, which is a lot quicker than downloading the app, creating an account, adding a payment method and reading a tutorial, which takes about five minutes rather than 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature will result in less Lime app downloads, and thus less user data. But Lime says it is more interested in hard sales at the moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also see a relatively high download conversion rate,” said another senior product manager, Zach Kahn. “The reduction in friction and needing to choose a payment method or vehicle drastically increases that conversion and makes up a meaningful percentage of our first trips now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kahn declined to provide conversion rates for those who were introduced to Lime via app-less rides. Murali also noted that more riders in test cities began reserving vehicles when Lime removed the cost. Previously, adoption was low at around 3%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all about ensuring people from different segments of society, in particular underserved areas, have less friction to access Lime vehicles,” said Murali. “In an underserved community, how much a scooter costs to ride is top of mind, so removing these unnecessary reservation fees makes them more likely to ride now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime, which is backed by Uber and Alphabet, is one of the companies </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the running for the coveted New York City pilot e-scooter program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bronx, a borough with many low-income communities and transit deserts. Each company has its own unique selling points. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpedestrian, for example, chooses to err on the side of first-class safety features and geofencing compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Murali says Lime’s leg up comes in its sheer size and ability to quickly execute new features.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t just say we put riders first, but we figure out exactly how to do it, and then we make those features and improvements in the app happen,” said Murali. “That’s what differentiates us; how much meaningful progress we are making, at what scale and how fast. We have this new tech in the form of App Clips, for example, and we tested it fast, brought a product to market and now we’re rolling it out in every market we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Lime claims to be the first micromobility company to introduce app-less riding, however </span><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-app-clips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple appears to have demoed App Clips by renting a scooter from Spin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also responded to New York’s RFP. A spokesperson from Spin said the company is working with Apple to bring the App Clip experience to its e-scooters in the future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Public App, a location-based social network that connects individuals to people in their vicinity, has raised $41 million in a new round, just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/lee-fixels-addition-leads-35-million-investment-in-india-inshorts-public-social-network/">securing $35 million</a> as the hyper-local Indian startup looks to expand its presence in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>A91 Partners led the new round in <a href="http://public.app/">Public App</a>, valuing the Indian startup at over $250 million (more than double since its last fundraise). The Indian startup, which also operates popular news aggregator app InShorts, said some of its existing investors also participated in the round but did not identify them. Public App counts Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition, SIG, and Tanglin Venture Partners among its investors. (The startup didn&#8217;t specify the name of the new round.)</p>
<p>Azhar Iqubal, founder and chief executive of Public App, said the new social network has amassed over 50 million users already and he aims to expand it outside the country eventually. The app, launched in April 2019, has already attracted individuals such as politicians and several major firms such as Amazon, HDFC Bank, and GSK that are using Public App to reach their audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Public has continued to maintain best in class retention and engagement metrics while scaling. We look forward to working closely with the founders to help build an outstanding company,&#8221; said Gautam Mago, General Partner at A91 Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>Public App, which is available in several major Indian languages (including Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Assamese, Gujarati and Marathi), allows shop owners and other local businesses to drive e-commerce and hire local talent, and political leaders, government authorities, and media houses to reach local audiences.</p>
