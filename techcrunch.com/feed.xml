										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimtfolsom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Folsom</a> came up through the engineering ranks in the 80s and 90s before founding the first of six companies, three of which successfully exited. Today, she is the founder and CEO at <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founders First Capital Partners</a>, a San Diego startup investment firm that invests in historically underrepresented founders with a non-traditional approach to funding called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/revenue-based-financing-the-next-step-for-private-equity-and-early-stage-investment/">revenue-based investment</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike most Silicon Valley VC firms, Founders First isn&#8217;t looking for the next unicorn. Instead, Folsom seeks out founders from historically underrepresented backgrounds &#8212; women, people of color, LBGTQ, veterans &#8212; with solid ideas and decent, if not spectacular, revenue and growth who have had trouble getting external investment to help build their businesses.</p>
<p>She focuses on B2B companies, usually in tech, that have a product and some wraparound services to go with it that you could turn into recurring subscription revenue. And with the additional help from Founders, coaching and guidance transform the business into a recurring revenue growth engine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of buying equity in the startup with the hope that it exits at some point, Folsom wants to partner with these companies by lending them money, usually between $50,000 and $1 million with an average investment of $300,000. As they succeed, she succeeds by getting paid back over time, based on monthly revenue with a profit cushion for her firm.</p>
<p>I sat down with Folsom last fall to discuss her career journey and why she decided to build a different kind of investment firm aimed at people who live and work in areas that are often invisible to Sand Hill Road.</p>
<h2>Startup dreams</h2>
<p>Folsom, who is a Black woman, came of age in the 80s as an engineer. She cut her teeth at firms like NCR where she helped design automatic teller machines, which were cutting edge technology in those early days of the IBM PC. But her goal was always to run a company, which she knew wouldn&#8217;t be possible at the corporations where she was working.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent the [early part of my career] trying to figure out how I could learn enough at the various corporations I worked at so I could go out on my own. And in time, during the dot-com era in the mid-90s, I launched my first company, and I went on to launch six before launching Founders First,&#8221; she told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She raised $30 million along the way, and learned what it takes to build a company, valuable intelligence she can share with the companies she funds today.</p>
<p>Folsom didn&#8217;t have many role models in the business world when she was starting; there were few women, and even fewer women of color, in engineering roles in the 1980s. Nor did she see women becoming leaders of large tech companies until the late 90s when Meg Whitman was named CEO of eBay and Carly Fiorina CEO at HP.</p>
<p>Even today, just 8.2% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, and women of color hold just 1% of CEO positions across the Fortune 1000, according to data from <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/8-2-of-fortune-500-ceos-are-women-according-to-the-2021-women-ceos-in-america-report-301400856.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women Business Collaborative</a>.</p>
<p>As for women of color leading startups, there were few getting venture funding when she was starting, and today the numbers aren&#8217;t much better. Crunchbase found in the first half of 2021 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1.2%</a> of $147 billion in venture funding went to Black founders. When you narrowed that data down to Black women founders, the number dropped to <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-black-women-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a minuscule 0.34%</a>.</p>
<p>After her experience as a founder, she wanted to set up a firm that helped people who were usually left out of this process to make it easier for them to access sources of capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The journey for diverse founders is the same &#8212; whether a woman, person of color, military veteran, LGBTQ or in a low and moderate income area &#8212; it&#8217;s tough to grow a business and get access to smart money such that you have a positive wealth creating outcome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why she launched Founders First in 2015.</p>
<h2>Giving back</h2>
<p>Folsom knew she had this wealth of experience as a startup founder who built companies, raised money and exited successfully, and she wanted to find a way to help others build businesses and get all the same advantages, especially people who were being left out of the venture financing world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having gone through this with my own experience a few times, I felt I knew enough that I could try something, but I wanted to structure this in a way that leveraged what I knew about the market I was going to serve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Folsom recognized<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that exiting offered a reasonable way for both investors and founders to make money, but she also knew that the process wasn&#8217;t terribly efficient and didn&#8217;t work for everyone because there were many viable companies that just couldn&#8217;t meet the revenue and growth requirements of most conventional VC firms.</span></p>
<p>She decided that by using revenue-based funding instead of equity, she could build her firm around a new class of founders, and create a successful investment vehicle for her partners, while helping these founders grow into much more successful companies than they could have on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t that perspective of unicorns in the dot-com era that there is today. But the path of getting to a unicorn company means you&#8217;re going to have to [ignore] a lot of really good companies that could have such a significant impact on markets,&#8221; Folsom said.</p>
<p>Rather than unicorns, Folsom says that she is looking to build “<a href="https://www.tbd.community/en/a/zebra-movement-starting-a-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zebras</a>.” In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/inside-the-effort-to-turn-startups-into-zebras-not-unicorns/">a 2019 story on Zebras Unite</a>, an organization building a community of zebra founders, zebras were described this way: “Because there are fewer financial incentives for investors to fund startups that are less focused on more traditional exit routes of either selling or going public, it can be hard to attract investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Folsom says that is precisely why she is trying to help zebras because “they can have a significant impact and build wealth for both the community they serve, and the founders.”</p>
<h2>Funding the fund</h2>
<p>When she launched in 2015, Folsom struggled to find investment partners in spite of her impressive credentials. Initially, she says that most investors thought the idea of investing in diverse founders using the revenue-based model was too unorthodox and they didn&#8217;t want to take a chance. She started by investing her own money, then went to the people who had invested in her in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, when I started Founders First, and I said that I wanted to focus on funding diverse founders and I wanted to use a model that was more relevant for business owners, people thought I was crazy. So I had raised money in the past, and my early investors…were people largely who were betting on me and had bet on me in the past,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She went through a proof of concept in 2017 with 10 companies, and when that worked, she began looking for a Series A. Before that happened though, in 2019 she secured <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/founders-first-capital-partners-secures-unprecedented-100-million-credit-facility-from-community-investment-management-cim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $100-million credit facility</a> from Community Investment Management, an organization that promotes inclusion through lending, a company that would seem to be a perfect match for Folsom&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>The firm scored a Series A totaling $11 million this year with a <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/rockefellerfounderfirst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9 million chunk in March</a> from The Rockefeller Foundation and the Surdna Foundation, followed by an additional <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/seriesa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million in November</a> from W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Pivotal Ventures (a Melinda French Gates company), the Schultz Family Foundation, and Arc Chicago, LLC.</p>
<p>She says that a growing awareness about institutional racism in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder has definitely helped a firm like hers trying to increase diversity investing to raise capital. Yet, while the firm is based in San Diego, as were all her startups, she says that not one California institutional investor stepped up to participate in the round.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Folsom looks for companies that are beyond the ideation phase and are making some money already with some potential to grow with the right tweaks to the business model. She says that the founders must have the right amount of experience, expertise and a commitment to growth. In addition, the founding team has to be open to surrounding themselves with new people who can help drive that growth.</p>
<p>She said that they evaluate investments in companies based upon the strength and predictability of their revenues, but never ask founders to put up personal credit or assets. The company&#8217;s revenue acts as collateral.</p>
<p>The funded company pays back the &#8220;loan&#8221; based on an agreed-upon cap amount over a specific term, usually three years. &#8220;For Founders First, that cap can be 1.35 to 2X over that term. The company makes monthly payments using a percentage of sales revenue. That percentage is agreed upon that can range between 2 percent and 10 percent [of revenue],&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>As an example of a success story using this model, she offers <a href="https://www.klarinetsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarinet Solutions</a>, which provides managed services for Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365. The company had a mid-six figure income that had been flat for three years prior to teaming up with Founders. Founders helped create new revenue streams, including recurring revenue, resulting in 2.5x revenue growth in two years, while doubling the size of its staff. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<p>Folsom is trying to use her expertise and experience to help other companies like Klarinet get access to funding to help them grow and develop their businesses in areas that typically are left behind when it comes to tech funding.</p>
<p>She wants people to understand that helping diverse founders is not a zero-sum game, certainly not with all the capital out there right now looking for a home. She understands from a lifetime of experience that the current climate pushing diversity and inclusion could change quickly. Folsom says that she has seen opportunity windows open in the past, only to close after a year or two, and she&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s different this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The window opens for a year, 18 months or two years and then it closes, and [I&#8217;m hoping that] this time when the window&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s not just going to be a [few people] that come out of it on the other side. We&#8217;ve got to be able to make it such that thousands of people do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps as firms like Founders First proliferate to help historically underrepresented groups gain access to more investment dollars, it will help keep that window wide open, creating wealth and jobs across communities that have been left behind in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hide your &#8220;Tony the Tiger&#8221;/&#8221;Eugene Levy&#8221; fan fiction &#8212; those phrases, along with hundreds of others, are now banned from Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app.</p>
<p>Now, any personal blog that flags itself as &#8220;mature&#8221; is not accessible on the iOS app &#8212; users will see a pop-up explaining that the content has been hidden because of &#8220;potentially suggestive or explicit content.&#8221; Tumblr also said that certain posts will be hidden in the search function and on user&#8217;s dashboards &#8212; which shows recommended posts, as well as content from the users they&#8217;re following.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order for us to remain in Apple’s App Store and for our Tumblr iOS app to be available, we needed to make changes that would help us be more compliant with their policies around sensitive content,&#8221; Tumblr <a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/671184848292118528/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in a blog post.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251910" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2251961" style="width: 656px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251961" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2251961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?w=646" alt="" width="646" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tumblr</p></div></p>
<p>Tumblr users developed an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/mobilebasic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial crowdsourced list</a> of tags that the Tumblr app has banned on iOS in order to comply with these policies. Some of the banned tags make sense for a platform trying to scrub itself of sensitive content &#8212; &#8220;porn,&#8221; &#8220;drugs&#8221; and &#8220;sex&#8221; are banned, for instance. Others are incomprehensible (or troubling if you think about them for too long), like the aforementioned &#8220;Tony the Tiger&#8221; and &#8220;Eugene Levy.&#8221; Even tags with the numbers 69 and 420 are banned.</p>
<p>Many Tumblr users flock to the site to talk anonymously about their experiences, but some of these tag bans effectively censor those conversations. Several tags related to <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-stimming-in-autism-260034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimming</a>, a common coping practice for autistic people, are banned, along with tags like &#8220;depression,&#8221; &#8220;PTSD&#8221; and &#8220;bipolar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that these adjustments will impact how users are able to access potentially sensitive content while using our iOS app, and that can be frustrating,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We are working on more thoughtful solutions which will be rolled out in the near future and we will keep the community updated as that work continues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A former Tumblr iOS engineer who blogs on the site as sreegs <a href="https://sreegs.tumblr.com/post/671649355334336512/alright-lets-talk-about-apple-and-tumblrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> what might be causing this problem and its ineffective, bandaid-like solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a reviewer [at Apple] runs your app and finds porn, your app is rejected and you’re told to correct the problem,&#8221; they <a href="https://sreegs.tumblr.com/post/671649355334336512/alright-lets-talk-about-apple-and-tumblrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in a blog post. The engineer said that this would happen about &#8220;once every five updates,&#8221; but once the offending post &#8212; provided to Tumblr via screenshot &#8212; was removed, the app would be good to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once in a while Tumblr would get a really persistent reviewer. It would take a handful of porn scrubs and re-submissions before they’d finally green-light an update,&#8221; sreegs wrote. The engineer thinks that this is similar to what&#8217;s happening on Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app now.</p>
<p>Tumblr has faced a years-long struggle with approval on the iOS App Store. In 2018, Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/tumblr-booted-from-app-store-due-to-child-porn/">taken down</a> from the App Store after child sexual abuse material (CSAM) made its way through the app&#8217;s filtering technology. A month later, the platform reacted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/tumblr-no-more-porn/">banning all porn</a> and other sexually explicit content, resulting in a near-immediate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">29% monthly traffic decrease</a>. Since then, the platform&#8217;s web traffic has remained relatively stagnant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180381" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180381" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png 1938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=1536,696 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimilarWeb</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s a Sisyphean task to scrub a user-generated content platform of any adult content. But Apple&#8217;s standards for Tumblr seem particularly stringent.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little part of me also wants to be cynical and say that since Instagram and Twitter are so big, they can get away with more than Tumblr can,&#8221; the former Tumblr iOS engineer theorized. &#8220;Combine that with Tumblr’s history of blatantly allowing porn up until the end of 2018. I can’t prove it, of course, but if Tumblr has a reputation at Apple, it can’t be a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tumblr content is being banned tag by tag, from #rule 34 to #long post.</p>
<p>Tumblr wrote on its <a href="https://changes.tumblr.com/post/671837799097532416/tuesday-december-28th-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changes blog</a> yesterday that it&#8217;s reviewing the list of tags that can&#8217;t be accessed in the iOS app, and it expects this review process to pick up in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re working on a web-based toggle that would allow folks to opt into allowing sensitive content in the iOS app,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Tumblr users often refer to the platform as a wasteland of the internet. The app itself once subtitled its iOS app as &#8220;<a href="https://unwrapping.tumblr.com/post/651763186035539968/hellsite-affectionate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hellsite (affectionate)</a>&#8221; in the App Store. So why do people keep using it?</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e’re busted enough that people assume the site is dead, so stuff like this has super easy workarounds,&#8221; a dedicated Tumblrite told TechCrunch. It&#8217;s not hard to find these workarounds if you search &#8220;tag ban,&#8221; on the site, but regular users know that the search function is very buggy anyway. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;I bet the broken search feature is actually coming in clutch here. Shit just doesn&#8217;t show up half the time, which means we can&#8217;t find it, but neither can Apple.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But what Tumblr lacks in working iOS apps and search functions, it makes up for with its algorithm&#8230; or lack thereof. As platforms like TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">face the Senate</a> to talk about the mysterious ways they serve content, Tumblr is making it work (define &#8220;work&#8221;) the old-fashioned way. It displays content from users you follow in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">honestly believe being a dumpster fire has fully worked in Tumblr’s favor at this point,&#8221; the avid Tumblr user said. &#8220;W</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e’ve got no algorithm, so we still get to curate our experience exactly how we want.&#8221;</span></p>

		Betsy Veneziano is an application support specialist at <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/">Tyler Technologies</a>. Throughout her career, she’s worked as a programmer for NASA and in multiple senior roles as an IT, product management and marketing leader.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Women in the workplace have historically been undervalued and underrepresented. That’s no secret, but it rings especially true in tech. In the United States alone, women make up <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-the-workforce-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 40% of the global workforce</a> and only fill <a href="https://ncwit.org/resource/bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of professional computing jobs</a>. Furthermore, a <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/skillsoft.com/prod/documents/SKS_Women-in-Tech-Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> found that 45% of surveyed women in tech said men outnumber them at work at ratios of 4-to-1 or greater.</p>
<p>Between the two of us, we possess nearly 70 years of experience working in tech(!), and if you ask us to recount our journeys, we’re likely to recall both great and not-so-great memories. For instance, one of us distinctly remembers being told by an eighth grade math teacher that she wasn’t good enough to take algebra. But in a fortuitous act of youthful defiance, she elected to major in math before landing her first post-grad job as a programmer for a NASA contractor. This would go on to launch a thriving, 50+ year career in tech.</p>
<p>A few decades later, the other remembers serving as the only woman on her company’s leadership team, often feeling isolated and alone. Again, defying the status quo, she instead used this as a catalyst to build a platform focusing on advancing women in the workplace, helping to identify and bring more female leaders to the table.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What these stories illustrate — and what the two of us agree about — is this: While many organizations and allies are making a more concentrated effort to help women progress in their careers and thrive in a male-dominated tech world, much of the onus on driving change and making improvements rests squarely on our shoulders as women. Women are resilient, and they are showing a fresh perspective, energy and dedication to ensure they rebound and regain influence, power and capital after being disproportionately affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a woman considering a career in tech or a seasoned professional, we all share in this mission and have a role to play in mitigating the gender gap and supporting one another.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that have worked for us over the years:</p>
<h2>Acknowledge the challenges and face them head-on</h2>
<p>If you like country music, you’ve likely heard the song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uHXS36LKNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Same Boat,”</a> with the chorus singing, “We’re all in the same boat, fishing in the same hole … ” Well, we may be fishing in the same hole — or, in the case of the past two years, riding out the same storm — but we’re still in very different boats.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hiring women returning from a career break can bolster existing talent pools, and these &#8220;returners&#8221; are often highly motivated, educated and more than qualified to take on a variety of roles.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Skillsoft’s <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/skillsoft.com/prod/documents/SKS_Women-in-Tech-Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Women in Tech report</a> shows that women, particularly those in technical fields, continue to face many of the challenges in the workplace that have long existed. The largest percentage cites their biggest issue as lack of equity in pay, followed by work and life balance, lack of opportunities and lack of training.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the United States during the pandemic, 34% of men working remotely with children at home received a promotion compared to 9% of women in the same situation, and 26% of men received a pay raise compared to just 13% of women, according to a <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/inequitable-effects-of-pandemic-on-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> by Qualtrics and The Boardlist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, the gender gap faced by women has shown slight signs of improvement in recent years, but this is a reminder that the road to equality is long and winding. It’s essential to remain persistent and not lose sight of your aspirations in the face of adversity. Even if you were an average student, you may soon find yourself in a meeting and realize you’re one of the smartest people there.</p>
<p>Learn from your mistakes, and when things are not going your way, find a way that works. This held true in the 1960s, and it still does today.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid of reinvention</h2>
<p>Life throws curve balls. For many women, taking a hiatus from work to have and care for children (or others, like aging parents) is inevitable. From personal experience, it can be difficult finding an employer willing to take a chance on women returning to the workforce. That’s why being persistent and willing to reinvent yourself is so important.</p>
<p>Maintain a mindset of curiosity throughout your career. That’s critical to ensure you’re able to adapt and pivot in any given situation. Perhaps after leaving the workforce, your previous position in product marketing is no longer there, or maybe you’ve reached a certain point in your career and no longer enjoy the work. Are your existing skillsets transferable to another role? Are there skills you’ve learned along the way — or could acquire — that allow you to shift to another path, such as development?</p>
<p>While pivoting and reinventing your career can be daunting, it can also pay major dividends in the long term.</p>
<p>For organizations, embracing this approach is good business. Hiring women returning from a career break can bolster existing talent pools, and these &#8220;returners&#8221; are often highly motivated, educated and more than qualified to take on a variety of roles. They want to put their best foot forward and bring mature and diverse perspectives, many of which they may have gained during their hiatus.</p>
<p>At a time when the tech workforce has a dire need for more skilled individuals — especially women — now is the time to enlist and empower this motivated group.</p>
<h2>Master the most important skill of all: Flexibility</h2>
<p>Change can be disruptive, but embracing and adapting to change can open a new world of possibilities. In order to come out ahead, it’s important to not just survive organizational change, but understand and learn how to thrive in it.</p>
<p>For example, several years ago one of us led a team that was bringing a new product to market that was tremendously exciting. Her company, however, decided to go a different route and bought a business that was already successful in this space. She could have worried about her job (and did, briefly), but instead, realized that the company needed help moving customers from the existing product to the acquired one. So she raised her hand, let them know that she could help and was subsequently assigned to the new team.</p>
<p>She’s now been with this company for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if an organization is asking such a drastic change of an employee, they must also provide the tools and resources needed for them to be successful in their new role. Here’s where creating a culture of learning, in which every employee is given the opportunity to develop new skills and capabilities, comes into play.</p>
<p>We all aspire to something bigger, to finding our place in — and contributing to — the world. Women&#8217;s careers are journeys made up of diverse and interwoven learning experiences that build leadership, power, influence, grit and resilience. We’ve made some good choices and faced some tough challenges during our combined 70-plus years in the tech workforce.</p>
<p>What have we learned? What you do with those learning lessons and how you build your story of perseverance, resilience and success as a female in technology is what matters most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past 12 months in cybersecurity have been a rough ride. In cybersecurity, everything is broken — it&#8217;s just a matter of finding it — and this year felt like everything broke at once, especially toward the end of the year. But for better or worse, we end the year knowing more than we did before.</p>
<p>Here we look back at the year that&#8217;s been, and what we learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="Ransomware costs businesses because of downtime, not ransom payments">1. Ransomware costs businesses because of downtime, not ransom payments</h3>
<p>The scourge of file-encrypting malware continues. Ransomware this year alone forced entire towns offline, blocked paychecks and caused fuel shortages, as entire company networks were held for ransom in exchange for millions of dollars in cryptocurrency payments. The U.S. Treasury <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/ransomware-trends-bank-secrecy-act-data-between-january-2021-and-june-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that ransomware operators are likely to make more from ransom payments in 2021 than they did during the past decade. But research shows that the businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/ransomware-recovery-can-be-costly-and-not-just-because-of-the-ransom/">face the most losses</a> through lost productivity and the often-arduous task of cleaning up after a ransomware attack — including incident response and legal support.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3 id="The FTC can order mobile spyware makers to notify their victims">2. The FTC can order mobile spyware makers to notify their victims</h3>
<p>SpyFone became the first-ever spyware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">to be banned in the U.S.</a> following an order from the Federal Trade Commission in September. The FTC accused the &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; app maker of creating the stealthy malware to allow stalkers and domestic abusers real-time access to data, such as messages and location history, on their victims&#8217; phones but without their knowledge. The FTC also ordered SpyFone to delete all of the data it had &#8220;illegally&#8221; collected and, for the first time, notify those whose <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-banning-stalkerware-provider-spyware-business?es_id=c3ee559ee1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phones were hacked</a> by its software.</p>
<h3 id="Cybersecurity VC funding doubled in size compared to last year">3. Cybersecurity VC funding doubled in size compared to last year</h3>
<p>It was a record-breaking year for cybersecurity VC funding. By August, investors had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cybersecurity-vc-funding-surges-to-a-record-11-5b-in-2021/">poured $11.5 billion in total venture funding</a> during the first half of 2021. That&#8217;s more than double the $4.7 billion spent during the same period a year earlier. The biggest raises include a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">$543 million Series A</a> for Transmit Security and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lacework-lands-525m-investment-as-revenue-grows-300/">$525 million Series D</a> for Lacework. Investors said a boon in cloud computing, security consulting and risk and compliance helped fuel the investments.</p>
<h3 id="A third of all legal demands for Microsoft user data are served with gag orders">4. A third of all legal demands for Microsoft user data are served with gag orders</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that tech companies are some of the biggest holders of user data, and — less surprisingly — a frequent target of government data requests that seek information for criminal investigations. But Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/microsoft-gag-orders/">this year warned</a> of the growing trend of the government attaching secrecy orders to search warrants, gagging the company from telling its users when their data is subject to an investigation.</p>
<p>Microsoft said one-third of all legal orders come with secrecy provisions, many of which are &#8220;unsupported by any meaningful legal or factual analysis,” according to the company&#8217;s consumer security chief Tom Burt. Microsoft said secrecy orders were endemic across the entire tech industry.</p>
<h3 id="The FBI was allowed to hack into private networks to clean up after a cyberattack">5. The FBI was allowed to hack into private networks to clean up after a cyberattack</h3>
<p>In April, the FBI launched a first-of-its-kind operation to remove backdoors in hundreds of U.S. company email servers left behind by hackers weeks earlier. China was ultimately blamed for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">the mass exploitation</a> of vulnerabilities in Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange email software, which the hackers used to attack thousands of company email servers around the U.S. to steal contact lists and mailboxes. The hacks left thousands of servers vulnerable, forcing companies to scramble to fix the flaws, but the patches didn&#8217;t remove a backdoor left behind, allowing the hackers to return and easily regain access.</p>
<p>A federal court in Texas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/">authorized the operation</a> allowing the FBI to exploit the same vulnerabilities as the hackers to remove the backdoors, fearing they could be further exploited by bad actors. Other countries have carried out similar &#8220;hack and patch&#8221; operations to take out botnets before, but this is the first known time the FBI effectively cleaned up private networks after a cyberattack.</p>
<h3 id="Fraudsters are targeting car insurance sites for unemployment benefit scams">6. Fraudsters are targeting car insurance sites for unemployment benefit scams</h3>
<p>Several car insurance companies were targeted this year for an unlikely, but an increasingly common, scam. Metromile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/metromile-website-bug-hacker/">a bug in its website</a> used for storing insurance quotes was misused to obtain driver license numbers. Then, months later, Geico said it too was targeted and had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/">driver license numbers scraped</a>.</p>
<p>Geico&#8217;s data breach notice blamed scammers who used the stolen license numbers &#8220;to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name.&#8221; Turns out that many U.S. states need a driver&#8217;s license before you can apply for state unemployment benefits — hence why the car insurance companies were targeted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has put the southern India factory of Foxconn on probation following protests from workers over subpar food and accommodation conditions, a concern both the firms acknowledged and pledged to address.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker didn’t say how long the probation will last, but an Apple spokesperson in India told TechCrunch that the firm “will ensure our strict standards are met before the facility reopens.”</p>
<p>Foxconn&#8217;s factory in the state of Tamil Nadu employs about 17,000 people. Protests erupted in the factory last week after hundreds of women who work at the plant and live in one of the hostels had to be treated for food poisoning and more than 100 were hospitalized, according to earlier local media reports.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251891" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The state government also intervened, and had asked Foxconn to review services provided to the workers.</p>
<p>Apple said it dispatched independent auditors to assess the situation after concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions were raised.</p>
<p>“We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Foxconn said it is investigating the recent issues and has found that &#8220;some offsite dormitory facilities do not meet the required standards.&#8221; A spokesperson told TechCrunch: &#8220;We are very sorry for the issue our employees experienced and are taking immediate steps to enhance the facilities and services we provide at the remote dormitory accommodations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Taiwanese giant, a key assembly partner for Apple, said it is also restructuring its local management team and management systems &#8220;to ensure we can achieve and maintain the high standards that are needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All employees will continue to be paid while we make the necessary improvements before restarting our operations and we will continue to provide support for our employees as they return to work,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Apple, which has expanded its local manufacturing efforts in India in recent years, has had to grapple with an issue of this kind in the world’s second-largest smartphone market. Last year, it placed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">Wistron, another key assembly partner, on probation</a> following worker riots over poor working conditions and unpaid wages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a congested sidewalk next to a busy mall in Shenzhen, a 20-something woman uses a smartphone app to order a milk tea on Meituan, a major food delivery company. In less than 10 minutes, the pearl-white drink arrives, not on the back of one of the city’s ubiquitous delivery bikes, but descending from the cloudy heavens, in a cardboard box on the back of a drone, into a small roadside kiosk. The only thing the scene is missing is a choir of angels.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Meituan, one of China&#8217;s largest internet companies, has flown 19,000 meals to 8,000 customers across Shenzhen, a city with close to 20 million people. The pilot program is available to just seven neighborhoods, each with a three-kilometer stretch, and only from a select number of merchants. The drones deliver to designated streetside kiosks rather than hover outside people&#8217;s windows as envisioned by sci-fi writers. But the trials are proof of concept for Meituan&#8217;s ambitions, and the company is now ready to ramp up its aerial delivery ambitions.</p>
<p>Tencent-backed Meituan isn&#8217;t the only Chinese tech giant that hopes to fill urban skies with tiny fliers. Alibaba, which runs Meituan&#8217;s rival Ele.me and e-commerce powerhouse JD.com, have also invested in similar drone delivery services in recent years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On the back of the pilot program, Meituan has applied to operate a commercial drone delivery service across all of Shenzhen, Mao Yinian, head of the company’s drone delivery unit, said at a press event this month. The application, submitted in September, is currently under review by Shenzhen&#8217;s aviation authority and is expected to receive approval in 2022, though the actual timeline is subject to government decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from experimenting in the suburbs to a central area. That means our operational capability has reached a new level,&#8221; said Chen Tianjian, technical expert at Meituan&#8217;s drone business, at the same event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Flying meals</h2>
<p>At the moment, Meituan&#8217;s delivery drones still involve a good amount of manpower. Take the milk tea order, for example. Once the drink is ready, Meituan&#8217;s backend dispatch system assigns a human courier to fetch it from the merchant in the mall and deliver it to the roof of the complex, where the company has set up drone takeoff pads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251848" style="width: 716px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251848" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="Meituan" width="706" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251848" class="wp-caption-text">Meituan&#8217;s drone launching pads on the roof of a mall in Shenzhen.

<p>Before takeoff, an inspector checks to see if the box holding the drink is secure. Meituan&#8217;s navigation system then calculates the quickest and safest route for the flyer to reach the pickup kiosk and off it goes.</p>
<p>The economic viability for using drones to deliver food of course is still unproven. Each of Meituan&#8217;s small aircraft, which are built with carbon fiber and weigh around 4 kilograms, can carry about 2.5 kilograms of food &#8212; roughly the weight of an average two-person meal, according to Chen. If someone orders just one cup of milk tea, the remaining space is wasted. Each kiosk can hold about 28 orders, so at peak hours, Meituan is betting on customers to gather their food promptly.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of creating waste with the new delivery boxes. Meituan said it has set up recycling bins next to the kiosks, but customers are also free to keep the containers. It won’t be surprised if some simply chuck them in the trash.</p>
<h2>Lessons from the U.S.</h2>
<p>From 2017 to 2018, China&#8217;s civil aviation authority started &#8220;following&#8221; the U.S. in light of research done by the Federal Aviation Administration on low-altitude aerial mobility, according to Chen. Not long after, the Chinese regulator began <a href="http://www.caac.gov.cn/en/HYYJ/NDBG/201802/P020180227616856973062.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formulating guides and rules</a> for this budding field. Meituan has similarly studied the paths of its American drone counterparts, but it realizes there isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all solution, as the two countries vary markedly in population density and consumer behavior.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251850" style="width: 708px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251850" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251850" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251850" class="wp-caption-text">A customer picks up her order from Meituan&#8217;s drone landing kiosk in Shenzhen.

<p>Most Americans live in suburban sprawl, while in China and many other Asian countries, people are concentrated in urban clusters. As a result, drones in the U.S. are &#8220;focused more on endurance,&#8221; Chen said. Drones developed by Google and Amazon, for example, tend to be &#8220;fixed-winged with vertical landing and takeoff abilities,&#8221; while Meituan&#8217;s solution falls into the category of a small helicopter, which is more suited for complex urban environments.</p>
<p>Technologies emerging in the U.S. often offer useful clues to similar developments in China. The picture doesn&#8217;t look particularly rosy at Amazon Prime Air. The behemoth&#8217;s drone delivery business <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/amazon-s-prime-air-drone-unit-quietly-disbanded-french-r-d-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> has been missing deadlines and laying off staff, though the firm said the unit continued to &#8220;make great strides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Air, Chen argued, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem to have a clear strategy&#8221; and &#8220;has been vacillating between&#8221; neighborhood delivery, which is the focus of Alphabet&#8217;s Wing, and long-distance transport, which is UPS&#8217;s strong suit. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the competition between China and the U.S. in low-altitude aerial logistics, the important thing is to figure out one&#8217;s strategic position. Everyone can design a UVA. The question is what kind of UVA and for what customers.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<p>When asked about the safety of drone delivery, Chen said Meituan&#8217;s solution &#8220;strictly follows&#8221; the rules laid out by the &#8220;civil aviation authority.&#8221; The Beijing-headquartered company picked Shenzhen as its testing field not only because it&#8217;s home to drone giant DJI and a mature UAV supply chain. The southern metropolis, known for its economic experiments, also has some of the most friendly drone policies in China, the expert said.</p>
<p>Each of Meituan&#8217;s drones is registered with Shenzhen&#8217;s Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management Information Service System (UATMISS). During flights, they are required to pin UATMISS with their precise locations every five seconds. More important, Meituan&#8217;s navigation system works to ensure the flyers avoid crowds and built-up areas on the ground, even at the cost of making detours.</p>

<p>The drones being piloted are Meituan&#8217;s third iteration on the model. They boast a noise level of about 50 decibels heard from a 15-meter distance, which is equivalent to &#8220;daytime street level,&#8221; according to Chen. The next generation will be even quieter, with noise reduced to &#8220;nighttime street level.&#8221; But the small aircraft can&#8217;t be too quiet, as regulators have advised that having an acceptable level of noise &#8220;is safer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Human help</h2>
<p>Meituan doesn&#8217;t plan to replace its millions of couriers in China with unmanned flyers outright, though automation would take some load off its overworked delivery platform. Its dispatch algorithms have come under criticism from both the public and the government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/viral-article-puts-brakes-on-chinas-food-delivery-frenzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly putting business performance above rider safety</a>. The challenge to recruit workers has already prompted labor-intensive industries to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> seek out robotic help</a>.</p>
<p>Meituan&#8217;s goal is to find a sweet spot for human-robot collaboration. Shenzhen&#8217;s road infrastructure is notoriously unfriendly to scooter drivers and cyclists, but aerial travel isn&#8217;t restricted by such ground obstructions. Drones can fly over large interchanges and put meals at spots convenient for couriers to fetch and carry to customers&#8217; final destination.</p>
<p>Meituan is already envisaging more automation. For instance, rather than having its staff manually swap depleted drone batteries, it has done R&amp;D on automated battery-swap stations. It&#8217;s also exploring a conveyor belt-like system that can move items from restaurants to drone takeoff pads nearby. These solutions are still years from large-scale deployment, but the food delivery titan is clearly gliding into an automated future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple has completed its first autonomous truck run on open public roads without a human in the vehicle, according to the company. TuSimple&#8217;s Autonomous Driving System (ADS) navigated 100% of the 80-mile run along surface streets and highways between a railyard in Tuscon, Arizona and a distribution center in Phoenix, which took place with no human intervention, marking a milestone for the company that aims to scale its technology into purpose-built trucks by 2024, says president and CEO Cheng Lu.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s one-hour and 20-minute drive along the I-10, which is a major freight route that runs from Los Angeles, California to Jacksonville, Florida, fits naturally into the company&#8217;s future commercial operations, in part because it has parking facilities set up in Tuscon, Lu said. While the truck did carry pre-loaded cargo, the focus of the pilot run was technological, rather than commercial. Over the last one and a half years, the company has performed 1,800 runs to the tune of 150,000 miles on this stretch of highway, and plans to continue testing its driver-out program into 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the logical next step and a key part of this evolution of our technology to have full commercial scale deployment,&#8221; Lu told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have to have on one route and one type of vehicle the ability to have all the features that you can operate without a driver on the road, and to have the level of reliability that&#8217;s required to take the driver out. And that&#8217;s significant R&amp;D engineering work. When you can demonstrate that you can safely remove the driver, even on one commercial operator route, it&#8217;s no longer a science project. It&#8217;s engineering work, and it takes time and capital and a lot of hard work from our team, but we&#8217;re very confident that we&#8217;ll be the first to have full-scale commercial deployment of autonomous trucks.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The autonomous trucking startup isn&#8217;t the first company to achieve driver-out operations in Arizona, a state with favorable AV testing and commercializing regulations that is trying to position itself as the leader in autonomous driving. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/waymo-starts-to-open-driverless-ride-hailing-service-to-the-public/">Waymo, for example, the autonomous driving arm of Alphabet, has been running driverless robotaxi operations in Phoenix</a> since October last year. Lu reckons highway driving is more challenging than urban driving, where reaction times and abilities to operate the vehicle safely are much simpler because of the slower speed limits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge of a truck, if you think about an 80,000 pound Class 8 vehicle, it drives on the highway at much faster speeds, like 65 miles per hour, and it&#8217;s significantly more heavy and harder to control, harder to break,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The safety implications, the reliability, are much higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s pilot demonstrates that for at least this operational design domain, the company has achieved Level 4 autonomous technology, which <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAE defines</a> as a system that is able to drive itself completely and will not require a human to take over. TuSimple&#8217;s Class 8 truck operated under favorable weather conditions between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight, which Lu says is when many trucks actually do operate. The ADS navigated surface streets, traffic signals, on-ramps, off-ramps, emergency lane vehicles and highway lane changes in open traffic, according to the company.</p>
<p>As a safety precaution, unmarked police vehicles followed at about a mile behind the truck in the event the truck came to an emergency stop. In addition, TuSimple implemented a survey vehicle to look for anomalies operating five miles ahead, as well as an oversight vehicle a half-mile behind that could put the autonomous truck in a minimal risk condition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s important for this industry to move forward is public opinion and our comfort with driverless trucks on the road, and that takes time to build,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;To take that first step, it&#8217;s important to have a lot of safety precautions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/navistar-teams-up-with-tusimple-to-produce-self-driving-trucks-by-2024/">TuSimple is currently operating retrofitted base trucks from Navistar</a>, one of the company&#8217;s OEM partnerships which was announced last year, but it plans to jointly develop semi trucks specifically designed for autonomous operations by 2024 that it can sell to third parties, says Lu.</p>
<div>&#8220;Commercializing driver-out technology means to create a holistic solution that allows autonomous trucks to move freight from terminal to terminal at scale,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;We are leveraging autonomous trucks today to move freight with safety drivers and running on fully autonomous mode. This achievement allows us to show we can do so without a safety driver on one route (no human at all). Our next step in commercializing is to add more reliability, which requires purpose-built trucks with OEM partners in order to be able to scale the number of trucks on the road without a driver.&#8221;</div>
<p>As of mid-December,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tusimple-dhl-deal/"> DHL Supply Chain has reserved 100 of these autonomous trucks</a> to integrate into its operations, bringing TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks/">The Traton Group, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy truck business, has also penned an agreement with TuSimple</a> to co-develop self-driving trucks. Both OEM partners own minority stakes in TuSimple.</p>
<p>The first generation of the trucks will be built with a steering wheel for certain operations in the yard, like shifting, or the process of separating and shifting the tractor and trailer, which will initially still need to be done by hand, says Lu.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Ultimately, [reaching L4 capabilities] is what&#8217;s required for us to solve the very big problem we&#8217;re facing in the freight industry, which is the lack of freight capacity,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;On the one hand, the demand for truck drivers and trucks continues to increase with e-commerce and the on-demand economy, but the supply side of things isn&#8217;t looking pretty. We have a driver shortage, significant driver turnover, safety costs are getting higher and of course, environmental concerns. All these things are leading to a bottleneck of the supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you play this out without new technology, it&#8217;s not getting better, and you and I don&#8217;t want to be truck drivers, our kids don&#8217;t want to be truck drivers. So we really need to achieve Level 4.&#8221;</p>

<p>Backed by international LPs, Southeast Asia-focused venture firms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/indonesian-venture-capital-firm-alpha-jwc-closes-433m-third-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha JWC</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/indonesia-focused-ac-ventures-closes-oversubscribed-205m-third-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/southeast-asia-focused-jungle-ventures-announces-225m-first-close-for-its-fourth-fund/">Jungle Ventures</a> raised their largest funds yet.</p>

<p>I always feel a bit silly using the term “Southeast Asia” because the region is so large and complex. It’s the easiest option when I’m trying to be succinct, but Southeast Asia consists of 11 countries, and obviously there are huge differences between, say, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>

<p>As a global financial center, one could argue that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/a-close-look-at-singapores-thriving-startup-ecosystem/">Singapore’s startup ecosystem is in a category of its own</a> when compared to its neighbors. And Indonesia in particular warrants special attention, as the fourth-largest economy in the world and the most populated Southeast Asian country with 273.5 million people. Both countries produced a fair amount of unicorns in 2021. In Singapore, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/a-close-look-at-singapores-thriving-startup-ecosystem/">Ninja Van</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/carousell-turns-unicorn-after-raising-us100-million-for-us11-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carousell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/automotive-marketplace-carro-hits-unicorn-status-with-360m-series-c-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2">Carro</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/nium-crosses-1b-valuation-with-200m-riverwood-capital-led-round">Nium</a> were among startups that hit unicorn status.</p>

<p>While Singaporean startups tend to focus on other Southeast Asian countries (or, in Nium’s case, the United States and Latin America), Indonesia-based founders, on the other hand, might have mid- or long-term plans for international expansion, but most of the ones I talked to plan to focus on expanding in the country for at least the next year or so. Not only is Indonesia very large, but it is also geographically complex, with <a href="https://www.embassyofindonesia.org/basic-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 17,000 islands</a>, of which about 6,000 are inhabited. Startups tend to launch in the Greater Jakarta area before expanding into other Tier 1 cities like Bandung and Surabaya, but many are eyeing smaller cities, especially fintech and e-commerce startups.</p>

<p>Here are a few sectors that took off in 2021, and are worth keeping an eye on in 2022:</p>
<h3>Investment apps</h3>
<p>A crop of investment apps, many aimed at millennial and first-time retail investors, raised small early-stage rounds at the beginning of 2021, only to quickly pick up much larger follow-on funding a few months later. Some examples include Indonesia-based crypto-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/">Pintu</a>, robo-advisor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m/">Bibit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a>, and Singapore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investment-app-syfe-raises-29-6m-series-b-led-by-returning-investor-valar-ventures/">Syfe</a>.</p>
<p>While rates of retail investment are still relatively low in Indonesia, that <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number is growing</a> because of increased interest in financial planning during the pandemic and the popularity of stock influencers, despite <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/influencers-have-a-new-racket-in-indonesia-investment-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about the legitimacy of some</a>.</p>
<h3>Indonesian SME-focused startups dig deeper into fintech</h3>
<p>According to government figures, there are<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/how-can-indonesian-smes-scale-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 62 million SMEs</a> (small to medium-sized enterprises) in Indonesia, but several founders told me this is likely an underestimate, especially since family-owned businesses or solo entrepreneurs tend to be undercounted. Regardless of their exact number, SMEs, many of which use Excel spreadsheets or paper ledgers to handle their accounting, present a lucrative opportunity for tech startups.</p>
<p>Most notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater">BukuWarung</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a>, two competing bookkeeping apps, both raised significant amounts of funding this year. The two startups are similar in that they are initially focused on helping SMEs digitize, but eventually plan to expand their product roster into financial services like working capital loans, using data users have already entered into their software to judge creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Some other startups that target SMEs include earned wage access and payroll management platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/gajigesa-a-fintech-for-unbanked-indonesian-workers-lands-6-6m-pre-series-a">GajiGesa</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/gajigesa-a-fintech-for-unbanked-indonesian-workers-lands-6-6m-pre-series-a">Wagely</a>.</p>
<h3>Social commerce</h3>
<p>People who live in Indonesia’s largest cities have a large choice of e-commerce platforms to choose from, but the selection is much less in more remote regions. This is partly due to a fragmented logistics infrastructure (but startups are also working on that, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/indonesian-logistics-startup-sicepat-raises-170-million-series-b/">SiCepat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesian-supply-chain-startup-advotics-raises-2-75m-led-by-east-ventures/">Advotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/kargo-raises-31-million-series-a-coronavirus-relief-fund/">Kargo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/04/waresix-raises-14-5m/">Waresix</a>), which means it is costly and time-consuming to receive goods.</p>
<p>That is where social commerce startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/">Super</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/indonesian-social-commerce-startup-evermos-lands-30m-series-b/">Evermos</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/indonesian-social-commerce-app-kitabeli-gets-10m-led-by-go-ventures/">KitaBeli</a> come in, hoping to replicate the success of Pinduoduo in China and Meesho in India. All focus on daily necessities like fast-moving consumer goods and food, and utilize the social commerce model to make the supply chain more efficient and affordable, since orders are made in batches by people who live in the same communities. In that sense, they can also be described as being at least partially logistics startups.</p>

<h3>E-commerce aggregators</h3>
<p>Startups that acquire small e-commerce brands, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">Thrasio</a>, have been attracting lots of funding in the United States and Europe for several years. But e-commerce aggregators took a little while longer to reach Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This year, two e-commerce aggregators officially launched there with venture capital funding, and both raised follow-on rounds a few months later. While many e-commerce aggregators focus on Amazon sellers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/e-commerce-aggregator-una-brands-raises-15m-series-a-five-months-after-its-launch/"> Una Brands</a> refers to itself as “sector-agnostic.&#8221; There is no dominant marketplace across APAC, so it has developed a system to find brands across platforms like Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, Rakuten and eBay. On the other hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/e-commerce-aggregator-rainforest-raises-20m-just-months-after-its-last-funding/">Rainforest</a> focuses on Asia-based Amazon sellers, but differentiates from other aggregators with its goal of becoming the online version of consumer goods conglomerate Newell Brands. With so many e-commerce sellers based in Asia, expect both Una Brands and Rainforest to grow, and other aggregators to launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GlobalBees, which raised one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/india-globalbees-raises-150-million-to-build-thrasio-like-house-of-brands/">largest Series A financing rounds</a> in India earlier this year, has entered the unicorn club as the New Delhi-headquartered firm scales its Thrasio-like house of brands.</p>
<p>Premji Invest, the investment firm controlled by Indian tycoon Azim Premji, led the nine-month-old startup’s Series B financing round, the young firm disclosed in a regulatory filing. The round, about $110 million, values GlobalBees at over $1.1 billion, the filing showed.</p>
<p>Steadview Capital, and existing investors Lightspeed, SoftBank and FirstCry, also participated in the $110 million equity round. Trifecta Capital additionally invested $30 million as debt in the new round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded by Nitin Agarwal, formerly of Edelweiss Financial, and Supam Maheshwari, a founder of FirstCry, <a href="https://www.globalbees.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlobalBees</a> acquires and partners with digitally native brands across categories such as beauty, personal care, home and kitchen, food and nutrition, and sports and lifestyle, with a revenue rate of $1 million to $20 million.</p>
<p>GlobalBees helps these firms scale and sell to marketplaces and through other channels in India and outside of the South Asian market.</p>
<p>“We have created and engaged with brands in the past and realized that most of these brands reach a scale after which it becomes too difficult to scale them,” Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year. He declined to comment on the new fundraise.</p>
<p>“Supam and I have been talking about this for several years, trying to find ways to disrupt this market. We think there’s an opportunity to create a new house of brands that is digital-native.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, Agarwal said GlobalBees was looking to acquire up to three dozen brands. Indian news and analysis publication the CapTable, which reported about GlobalBees&#8217; talks to raise a round at the unicorn valuation in October, said then that GlobalBees was in different stages of conversations to <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/globalbees-mensa-seek-unicorn-valuations-india-thrasio-10club-goat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close deals with at least 15 brands</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251813" style="width: 914px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251813" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251813 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="880" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,292 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,748 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,662 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/globalbees-brands-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251813" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the brands GlobalBees has acquired in recent months. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tracxn</p></div></p>
<p>Scores of startups in India today are trying to replicate what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model. (Though it&#8217;s worth noting that Thrasio took about two years to become a unicorn.)</p>
<p>Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra’s chief executive, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/india-mensa-a-house-of-d2c-brands-becomes-unicorn-in-just-six-months/">recently raised a $135 million Series B financing round</a> that valued the startup at over $1 billion. It was six months old at the time of the funding announcement. Titan Capital, which has backed about 200 startups in India, has invested in Powerhouse91. 10club, another similar startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">raised $40 million earlier this year</a>— though much of it was in debt.</p>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell midrange to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so underappreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
<p>With more than 800 brands, India is quickly becoming a fast-growing market for direct-to-consumer brands.</p>
<p>Many investors believe that the Amazons and Flipkarts of the world have laid the rails for digital commerce, and smarter and more profitable businesses can be built atop them.</p>
<p>“Newer models on social commerce will continue to penetrate deeper into Bharat while revenue based financing models will provide an alternate financing option to equity dilution conscious smaller D2C brands. At the same time, consumers will demand frictionless post-checkout journey (auto filled card/customer details, RTO predicts, one step checkout). Startups providing shovels in the gold rush (Shiprocket, GoKwik) will have the potential to reap big wins,” a <a href="https://ajuniorvc.com/2022-predictions-2021-recap-ipo-d2c-fintech-indian-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis said</a>.</p>
<p>GlobalBees joins over 40 other India-based startups that have entered the unicorn club this year, up from 11 last year. Several high-profile investors, including SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital and Tiger Global have doubled down on their investments in the South Asian market in recent quarters.</p>

<p>Hi all, and welcome back to Daily Crunch for December 28, 2021!</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re all staying dry, warm and safe as we come to the end of another weird year. I haven&#8217;t heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/Alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> how his vacation is going, which I&#8217;m hoping means he&#8217;s having a great time and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/gift-guide-techcrunchs-favorite-things-of-2021/">playing way too much Crusader Kings III</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Alex should be back next week. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll try to be half as good at wrapping up the top stories from the past day or so.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/wtf-is-xyz/"><strong>WTF is .xyz?:</strong></a> Have you noticed the sudden uptick in &#8220;.xyz&#8221; domains in the wild? Wondering why? Anita Ramaswamy has a great overview of .xyz&#8217;s history, its growing role in the web3 world and how Google/Alphabet might&#8217;ve sparked the trend.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/kimberly-bryant-suspended-black-girls-code/"><strong>Black Girls Code CEO suspended:</strong></a> What&#8217;s going on at Black Girls Code? Why was the non-profit org&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Kimberly Bryant, suddenly suspended? Natasha Mascarenhas talked to many of those involved to get some answers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/the-matrix-resurrections-is-a-bad-movie-but-it-has-a-good-take-on-tech/">&#8216;The Matrix: Resurrections&#8217; is a bad movie, but…:</a></strong> I still haven&#8217;t watched the new &#8220;Matrix&#8221; (I have a toddler running around, so watching any movie without songs and/or animated dogs is rare) so I can&#8217;t vouch for Devin&#8217;s headline, but I appreciate him finding a diamond (the movie&#8217;s take on our relationship with tech) in what he otherwise considers the rough (everything else.) Spoiler warnings, btw.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/sectors-where-new-zealand-startups-are-poised-to-win/"><strong>Where New Zealand startups are poised to win:</strong></a> The startup scene in New Zealand is rocketing — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/rocket-lab-reimagines-rocket-design-with-its-neutron-launch-vehicle/">quite literally</a>. Besides rockets, where else might New Zealand find wins? Rebecca Bellan talked with investors in the region and came away with four verticals to watch.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/hallow-a-religious-app-for-catholics-talks-the-talk-as-religious-platforms-draw-investor-attention/">Religious apps draw investor attention:</a></strong> I&#8217;ll never stop being amazed by Connie Loizos&#8217; ability to spot trends I never would&#8217;ve noticed. This time it&#8217;s a huge uptick in investment in faith-focused apps — from $6.1 million in 2016 to $175 million this year. Connie sat down with the founder of one of these apps (Hallow) for insights on the landscape.</li>

<h2>How to be one of the “haves” of SaaS</h2>

<p>Software as a service has leveled the playing field for startups in the last decade, but in terms of venture capital, the winners still take all.</p>
<p>According to Sean Fanning, a VP on OpenView’s investment team, companies that post stellar growth often take the bulk of VC investment, leaving the lower performers to fight for scraps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/how-to-be-one-of-the-haves-of-saas/">In an in-depth post,</a> Fanning shares three tactics used by SaaS companies with an attractive enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/R) multiple:</p>
<p>Continued execution against large and growing market opportunities.</p>
<p>Leveraging a business model that enables rapid growth (i.e., product-led growth).</p>
<p>Strong unit economics that support high free cash flow margins over the long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Waymo, Alphabet&#8217;s autonomous driving technology arm, is partnering with Chinese automaker Geely to build an all-electric, self-driving ride-hailing vehicle. The companies will integrate Waymo Driver, Waymo&#8217;s AV system, into Geely&#8217;s Zeekr vehicles for use in U.S. markets &#8220;in the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Waymo is not providing a specific time frame for either the start of production or when these vehicles are expected to hit the streets, the partnership signals that Waymo is pursuing a multi-platform approach to OEM partnerships. Waymo&#8217;s current ride-hail fleet is made up of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/inside-the-next-gen-tech-on-waymos-self-driving-jaguar-i-pace/">Jaguar I-Paces</a> and Chrysler Pacifica hybrids, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/waymo-starts-to-open-driverless-ride-hailing-service-to-the-public/">provide autonomous rides in Phoenix, Arizona</a>. The company has also expanded its partnership with Stellantis, which owns Fiat Chrysler automobiles, to include local delivery services. Waymo&#8217;s plans with Geely should not have an effect on the company&#8217;s existing partnerships, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/chinese-automaker-geely-launches-luxury-ev-brand-zeekr/">Zeekr, a luxury EV brand that Geely established in March</a>, launched its first premium model, a sleek crossover, last month in China. The Waymo version, which renderings depict with more of a minivan look, are being custom designed and engineered in Gothenburg, Sweden. Once they are shipped to the U.S., Waymo will integrate its Driver, which includes hardware like lidar, sensors and cameras, as well as software, into the vehicles and deploy them within its ride-hailing fleet, says the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251641" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The Zeekr vehicles are designed to be &#8220;rider-first,&#8221; with &#8220;a flat floor for more accessible entry, easy ingress and egress thanks to a B-pillarless design, low step-in height, generous head and legroom and fully adjustable seats,&#8221; according to a Waymo blog post. The interior, which will not include a steering wheel or pedals in anticipation of a fully driverless future, will instead have plenty of head and legroom to stretch out and relax, with reclining seats and screens and chargers within arm&#8217;s reach.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<div>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Other AV companies, like Cruise and Argo AI, have also revealed plans for purpose-built ride-hailing EVs. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">Cruise unveiled its Origin</a>, which is designed for ridesharing, and in September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving/">Argo and Volkswagen revealed the plans for a jointly developed autonomous van, the ID Buzz AD</a>, which should launch commercially in Hamburg, Germany as part of an autonomous ride-pool system in 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last few days have been fairly quiet, so far as CES is concerned &#8212; no doubt owing to the holiday. The last major dropout<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/microsoft-pulls-in-person-ces-2022-presence/"> came from Microsoft</a>, which confirmed on Christmas Eve it would no longer be traveling to Las Vegas for the event. That news followed similar announcements from GM, Google, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok and Pinterest.</p>
<p>A number of big names are still confirmed for next week’s show, including Samsung, LG, BMW, Qualcomm and Sony. As of December 23, the CTA noted that “over 2,200” companies were still planning to attend the show. I will say that, anecdotally, I’ve heard from a number of startups who have opted not to attend, and also plenty who are still planning to be at the show in-person.</p>
<p>Today, some key companies have added their names to the list of the former, including AMD, MSI, OnePlus and Proctor &amp; Gamble. A spokesperson for AMD confirmed the company’s decision in a statement to TechCrunch:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>After careful deliberation, AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.</p></blockquote>
<p>OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the event, but instead planned to hold an event in Las Vegas to coincide with the big show. The company has since confirmed with TechCrunch that it will no longer be holding an in-person event in Vegas, out of growing concern around the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Gaming firm MSI confirmed via <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> that it will not be attending the show. “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases,” VP Sam Chern said in a statement. “The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”</p>

<p>Proctor &amp; Gamble, which has used the event to debut technologies for brands like Gillette and Oral-B, announced its decision in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since our planning began for CES 2022, the health and well-being of P&amp;G people and partners has remained our top priority. While we recognize the significant safety protocols implemented by the Consumer Technology Association, given rapidly shifting developments with COVID-19, we’re shifting to an all-virtual experience out of an abundance of caution.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an op-ed</a> run by the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Christmas Day, CTA head Gary Shapiro pushed back on media coverage of big tech dropouts from the show, which he deemed the “drumbeat of press and other critics who tell the story only through their lens of drama and big name companies.”</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-holmes-2b82778/">Alex Holmes</a> is chairman and CEO of <a href="https://ir.moneygram.com/">MoneyGram International</a>, the global leader in the evolution of digital P2P payments.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Governments around the world have been looking at adopting, regulating and even banning cryptocurrencies since the inception of Bitcoin. Ever since, the crypto ecosystem has been a rocket ship ride to the moon and back (multiple times). Today, it seems that more people than ever have hopped on for the ride.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen a massive shift toward digital platforms across all industries as a result of the pandemic. Political leaders globally have followed suit by taking steps to move their economies in the same direction.</p>
<p>One of the most recent examples is El Salvador, which made headlines by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender (a move that has since been protested by its citizens). In the initial announcement, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvadors-president-says-will-send-bill-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the country&#8217;s president directly connected crypto as a competitor to remittances</a>, noting this would increase the amount of money low-income families in El Salvador receive from remittances by the &#8220;equivalent of billions of dollars every year.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			To be an effective form of cross-border payment flows, digital assets must overcome innate challenges that already dampen their adoption ability regardless of a cross-border use case.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Remittances — the act of individuals sending money to support their families and communities back home — make up a significant component of GDP for many countries. In fact, global remittances <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/infographic-what-are-the-world-s-top-remittance-recipients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">totaled roughly $700 billion in 2020</a>, $540 billion of which is noted to have been sent to low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Bank. El Salvador <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=SV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received nearly $6 billion</a> of that. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are estimated to currently make up less than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/remittance-firms-slow-add-bitcoin-despite-el-salvador-move-2021-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the volume of global cross-border remittances</a>.</p>
<p>Is cryptocurrency an effective replacement for remittances? No, at least not yet.</p>
<p>The demand for each of our services is a market-specific story, and it’s not uncommon for recipients to still pick up cash despite having real-time digital and cash pay-out options available. This is not surprising, as many individuals who receive remittances have little or no ability to pay for goods and services digitally. Instead, they use retail, bank and other physical locations in the MoneyGram network to access the funds they need.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Digital currencies are certainly an additive factor, and crypto will no doubt have an impact in the years to come. But it will take time, and there are several headwinds to mainstream adoption and displacing cash for the millions of families who continue to rely on it.</p>
<p>For one, cryptocurrency transfers, quite frankly, currently aren’t a cheaper, faster or easier alternative than cash, particularly considering the complexities of converting crypto to/from local currencies.</p>
<p>Specific to El Salvador, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remittances accounted for around a quarter of the country&#8217;s GDP</a> and benefit approximately 360,000 households. We know that buying and selling crypto is a much more complicated process than transferring and accepting money via a remittance platform. It is highly unlikely that all of those households are going to learn and adapt to an entirely new payment system soon.</p>
<p>Additionally, to buy goods or services with crypto, the digital asset needs to be converted back into local currency in almost all circumstances. That’s tough for the millions of people who rely on remittances for quick access to funds for essential daily needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-moneygram-survey-reveals-strong-remittance-consumer-sentiment-driven-by-needs-abroad-and-digital-adoption-301446698.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent customer survey</a> found that senders are mainly transferring money to cover the costs for the very basics of survival and well-being, primarily for food (73%), healthcare (59%) and housing (54%). Crypto is simply not ready to be the lifeline that so many of these individuals depend on for immediacy. Crypto can be particularly volatile compared to most local currencies, so we cannot rely on it as a safe haven for those who are depending on $20 to be $20 by the time it reaches them. Look no further than <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin’s price history</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, many countries have yet to recognize or provide legal pathways for cryptocurrency trading/payments, including the United States. The hype makes it seem as if we’ll be paying in Bitcoin for our holiday presents in 2022, but there are <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/11/20/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens on the other side of the aisle</a> taking the opposite approach.</p>
<p>To be an effective form of cross-border payment flows, digital assets must overcome innate challenges that already dampen their adoption ability regardless of a cross-border use case, including lack of utility, expense of exchanges, complexity, volatility, and limited on and off-ramps to local currencies.</p>
<p>I do believe crypto and digital currencies can eventually help streamline cross-border payments. Personally, I also have a great time &#8220;holding&#8221; crypto as an investment and being a part of this emerging industry. However, like most new technologies, digital assets still have their fair share of obstacles to address before they become the norm in global remittances.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: MoneyGram has embarked on a partnership with Stellar that allows digital wallets connected to the Stellar network to access MoneyGram&#8217;s global retail platform.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of high-profile exhibitors are opting out of next year’s CES. Samsung is among those big names sticking it out for next week’s show &#8212; which always proves a good exhibition of the company’s massive breadth in the electronics space, from TVs to washing machines to the occasional robot.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, however, Samsung’s C-Lab division has been its CES secret weapon, showcasing some of the projects built by the company’s in-house incubator. Created by employees who are afforded the ability to create pet projects, C-Labs’ projects aren’t always practical, but they’re often fascinating.</p>
<p>Effectively, they’re things that are traditionally out of the scope of a tech colossus like Samsung. Last year’s class, for instance, included an artificial window and smart highlighter.<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-to-showcase-innovative-startup-projects-from-c-lab-inside-and-c-lab-outside-at-ces-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> This year’s batch</a> splits things into three categories: C-Lab Inside, C-Lab Outside and projects that have effectively spun out from Samsung.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Inside &#8212; the earliest of the three stages &#8212; includes an AI-powered smartphone app, called Piloto, designed to improve device habits; exam service PROBA; Innovision, which is designed to detect eye alignment in infants; and ZamStar, a guitar that features built-in LED guides for education. Outside, which was founded in 2018, is an accelerator that provides guidance to South Korean startups. That list includes nine companies. Per Samsung:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Petnow, an AI-based pet biometric recognition solution</li>
<li>Digisonic, a 3D immersive audio solution for mobile devices</li>
<li>Verses, an interactive metaverse music app</li>
<li>bitsensing, an array of imaging radar technology solutions for autonomous driving and smart cities</li>
<li>SELECTSTAR, an AI-based data collection and labelling platform</li>
<li>RGT Inc., a multifunctional modular serving robot</li>
<li>MoreDream Inc., an input system to improve accessibility and productivity for the visually impaired</li>
<li>Yellowknife, a vehicle display customization platform</li>
<li>MONIT, a smart diaper care solution for elderly patients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Founded in 2012, C-Lab has worked with 406 companies thus far &#8212; a number Samsung expects to hit 500 by some point next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year was a watershed for the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) industry, marked by billion-dollar exits, huge venture deals and more partnerships. But in many ways, the past year should be thought of as the setting of a chess board before a match: the pieces are in place. Now it is time to play.</p>
<p>That means that 2022 will be a make it or break it year, at least for those developers who have publicly stated ambitions of hitting commercial operations by 2024. What will next year hold in store, not just for them, but for the sector more broadly? Below are some top predictions and trends to look out for in the coming year.</p>
<h2>“It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</h2>
<p>Overall, the sentiment from experts, analysts and VCs we spoke to seemed to be that 2022 will be critical for separating the wheat from the chaff &#8212; specifically when it comes to certification of the aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, a prerequisite for any company that hopes to get their aircraft off the ground.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The main story of 2022, it&#8217;s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</p>
<p>Due to certification timelines, Cecutta said that companies that want to enter service in 2024 need to start flying with the FAA for certification credit by the end of next year in order to hit that target.</p>
<p>David Wyatt, a technology analyst at IDTechEx, agreed. “What I want to see in 2022 is more aircraft in the air,” he said. “To have something that&#8217;s certifiable by [2024], they have to start getting substantial aircraft in the air and really demonstrating the capabilities of those aircraft.”</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re not going to be complete, finished products, but at least a real ramp up in prototyping is what you&#8217;d be wanting to see from these companies who have raised the money,” he added. “They need to start demonstrating to investors that they&#8217;re capable of building these aircraft and getting them through flight certification.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Automakers get serious</h2>
<p>While many of the biggest players in eVTOL are startups (or startups-turned-public companies, thanks to SPAC deals), they aren’t the only ones looking to take advantage of the potentially huge market for air taxis, drone deliveries or other applications of electric aviation.</p>
<p>Hyundai and Honda have not been shy about their eVTOL ambitions, with Hyundai unveiling a concept eVTOL at CES in 2020. At the end of 2021, it announced it had spun out its urban air mobility division into a separate business arm, dubbed Supernal, with the aim of bringing an aircraft to market in 2028.</p>
<p>Other automakers, principally Toyota and Stellantis, have already started joining in &#8212; in the form of major investments in Joby and a manufacturing deal with Archer, respectively. But we could see other automakers announcing their own eVTOL projects next year, Cyrus Sigari, co-founder and managing partner of UP Partners, said.</p>
<p>“I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a meaningful move from Ford or GM in 2022,” he said.</p>
<h2>More SPACS</h2>
<p>As we detailed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/top-evtol-trends-2021/">part one</a> of our eVTOL retrospective, 2021 was undoubtedly the year of the SPACs. There was a notable uptake of this financial vehicle, not just in eVTOL but across the electric mobility space. It’s unclear whether this trend will continue into 2022, but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets.</p>
<p>Amy Burr, president of airline JetBlue’s venture capital arm, said that SPACs may be the best way to raise capital and access public markets for pre-revenue companies like electric aviation developers.</p>
<p>“I believe that that&#8217;s their only path forward, unless they could just continue to do venture rounds and raise more capital that way, which is always a possibility,” she said.</p>
<p>Sigari suggested there’s room for “two more” SPACs next year. “I&#8217;d be very surprised if the number is greater than five and I’m pretty sure it&#8217;s not going to be zero. This is assuming we don&#8217;t have a global financial crisis.”</p>
<p>There could be a slight tempering of the public market’s appetite for aviation technology. At the end of November, air taxi developer Volocopter cancelled its SPAC plans due to an “extremely unfavorable” environment for SPACs, <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/volocopter-ende-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a German publication reported</a>.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s always potential out there for more SPAC deals, but whether the Volocopter [deal] falling through is a sign of a general cooling of interest towards those kinds of deals, I guess we&#8217;ll have to see,” Wyatt said.</p>
<p>One thing that most experts we spoke to didn&#8217;t mention (or didn&#8217;t seem overly concerned with) is consolidation, which has hit other hot tech industries like autonomous vehicles. &#8220;With time it&#8217;s just inevitable that there will be consolidation and there will be companies that might not make it,&#8221; Cecutta said.</p>
<p>That omission suggests, at least to us, that perhaps the industry has not yet reached the apex of the hype cycle for emerging technologies &#8212; which suggests that despite the crazy cash flow and growing fanfare, there may still be a rocky road ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New Zealand has historically been capital-starved, but recent investments have increased access to early-stage VC funding. Now, certain industries are emerging as areas where New Zealand can win.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a remote island nation in the middle of the South Pacific, New Zealand is experiencing the stirrings of a burgeoning startup scene. The country has historically been capital-starved, but recent investments from the government and foreign investors have significantly increased access to early-stage venture capital funding. Now, certain industries are emerging as potential areas where New Zealand can win in the tech space.</p>
<p>Deep tech, medtech/biotech, climate tech, and crypto and blockchain are all areas that investors say they&#8217;re either actively investing in or watching for signs of scale.</p>
<p><em>Note: All monetary amounts are listed in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stipulated. </em></p>
<h2>Deep tech</h2>
<p>New Zealand has the right mix of deep tech-focused capital and resources, strong engineering schools and major success stories that are helping create technologically sophisticated, globally scalable startups.</p>
<p>During the first half of this year, total investment in New Zealand&#8217;s early-stage sector increased 78% from the first half of 2020, 42% of which went directly to deep tech startups, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.nz/insights-and-publications/2021-publications/startup-investment-october-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to PwC</a>. Much of that funding came from New Zealand Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP), a government entity established to create a vibrant early-stage environment in New Zealand, via its Elevate fund of funds program that provides capital to New Zealand VCs investing in Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>Last October, <a href="https://www.nzgcp.co.nz/funding/elevate-venture-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate allocated $20 million</a> to a fund managed by deep tech VC firm Pacific Channel. More recently, <a href="https://www.nzgcp.co.nz/news-and-media/new-blog/nuance-fund-receives-17m-nzgcp-committment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate committed $17 million to Nuance Connected Capital’s</a> fund focused on deep tech innovations, as well as $45 million to GD1’s Fund 3, which focuses on deep tech as well as connected hardware, enterprise software and health tech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			New Zealanders make really good founders. &#8230; There&#8217;s something about just growing up on a farm or, you know, playing beer float out in the lakes and rivers; New Zealand is just really resourceful. 							<cite>Blockchain NZ Chair Bryan Ventura</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Then there are groups, like Outset Ventures, formerly LevelTwo, that are geared toward helping seed and pre-seed deep tech startups get going. Outset is home to New Zealand’s only two deep tech unicorns, Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, both of which have spun out numerous other deep tech companies. Outset continues to be a resource for seed-stage startups that need not only money, but also connections to larger companies and access to workshops and labs. Just last year, Outset and Icehouse Ventures, a VC firm, partnered to raise a $12 million fund, which launched this April, for early-stage science and engineering startups. Imche Fourie, CEO of Outset, said the company has already made 40 investments from that fund.</p>
<p>Notable deep tech companies out of New Zealand include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/foundry-lab-raises-8m-to-quickly-cheaply-create-metal-castings-using-a-microwave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundry Lab</a>, a startup that creates metal castings quickly and cheaply with a microwave; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/soulmachines/empathetic-customer-experiences-the-next-big-step-for-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soul Machines</a>, a platform that creates lifelike digital avatars that animate autonomously, responding to interactions and interpreting facial expressions, with personalities that evolve over time; and Dennisson Technologies, a wearables company that’s developing soft exosuits that incorporate 4D material technology to actively assist people with limited mobility due to physical or neurological disability.</p>
<p>The most Kiwi of deep tech startups, however, is Halter — a company that spun out of Rocket Lab and produces solar-powered smart cow collars that allow farmers to remotely shift and virtually fence and monitor cows in order to optimize pasture time. Founder Craig Piggott grew up on a dairy farm watching his parents struggle with the relentless work. After studying engineering at Auckland University of Technology and working at Rocket Lab, Piggott combined his experience to come up with a somewhat wacky and ambitious hardware and software play. Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, who backed Halter, told TechCrunch he thinks it will be a globally scalable billion-dollar company.</p>
<p>The epitome of New Zealand’s deep tech scene is its over <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-11/Deloitte%20NZ%20Space%20Economy%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.75 billion space industry</a>. Rocket Lab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is now a U.S.-owned company after a SPAC merger</a>, put New Zealand on the map as a place with minimal air traffic, clear skies and favorable aerospace regulations. As a result, companies are forming that can either send payloads into space or provide services to existing space companies.</p>
<p>Outset-backed Zenno Astronautics, for example, is developing a fuel-free satellite propulsion system that uses magnets powered by solar panels. Dawn Aerospace is working toward a remotely piloted aircraft that could take off like a normal airplane, drop a satellite payload and be back home in 15 minutes. And Astrix Autonautics, a startup founded by three Auckland University students, is being trialed by Rocket Lab to see if they can more than double the power-to-weight ratios of solar arrays used today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve visited a crypto company’s website recently, you’ve probably visited a URL ending in “.xyz&#8221; instead of its cheugier counterpart, .com. From fintech Block, formerly known as Square, to venture firm Paradigm, to blockchain startups like Mirror, .xyz has become the go-to URL ending for many web3 companies. But what does it mean, and why has it caught on in the web3 space?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz, released to the public in 2014, first surged in popularity one year later when Google parent Alphabet decided to use it for their rebranded website. The internet behemoth had run into an increasingly widespread problem &#8212; the .com URLs for their brand were already taken, with BMW’s fleet management division using </span><a href="http://www.alphabet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alphabet.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and American Broadcasting Corporation at </span><a href="http://www.abc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abc.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Alphabet decided to open up shop at abc.xyz, which presented an “unlimited branding opportunity” for its “futuristic company,” Daniel Negari, </span><a href="https://ceo.xyz/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz’s 36-year-old founder and CEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told TechCrunch in an email. Now, .xyz may be one of the top five top-level domains (TLDs) in the world by traffic, according to the company’s own DNS data.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz was created to “provide users around the world competition and choice when it comes to their domain name,” and is “the first truly generic domain extension with no inherent meaning,” according to Negari. While .com was meant for commercial use, .net for networks and .org for organizations, Negari envisioned .xyz as the TLD choice for users who felt they did not fit neatly into one of these categories or wanted to stand out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe the market has adopted our mantra of “for every website everywhere,” Negari said. “Our mantra of openness and inclusion for everyone and everything has bled through into a community of creative thinkers that has embraced .xyz as their domain.”</span></p>
<h2>How .xyz met web3</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negari is an active crypto investor with “numerous” investments in the space, including Gemini, MoonPay and BlockFi, he said. Because of his interest in crypto, he reached out to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) creator Nick Johnson to pitch him a collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That historic collaboration allowed early adopters to use a .xyz domain as their wallet address,” Negari said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2250498" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250498" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2250498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?w=300" alt=".xyz founder and CEO Daniel Negari" width="451" height="293" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250498" class="wp-caption-text"><em>.xyz founder and CEO Daniel Negari <strong>Image Credits:</strong> XYZ</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENS </span><a href="https://forkast.news/what-is-ens-ethereum-name-service-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows users to create a universal nickname</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all their crypto addresses, providing a searchable database to make crypto wallets and transactions, which otherwise reside on a variety of different platforms, more easily accessible. Users can now create profiles to share their social media handles or other personal information in ENS using its native .eth domain or on a .xyz domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz has continued to find ways to collaborate with ENS and work with the crypto community. It </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/ethxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it launched its “eth.xyz” service, allowing users to search individual ENS profiles simply by adding “.xyz” to the end of their .eth name rather than having to go to the ENS database to look them up, Negari said. </span></p>
<p>By allowing cryptocurrency holders to buy domains in their preferred names using Ethereum, ENS has creatively monetized users&#8217; desire to leverage the internet as an identity-building tool. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, for example, bought the ENS domain name tobi.eth earlier this month for 30 ether, equivalent to more than $120,000 at the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>Although .xyz domains currently fall under the purview of the DNS system, managed by internet regulatory authority <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICANN</a>, several parties are now working to develop a decentralized alternative to this system to underpin web3, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/yat-thinks-emoji-identities-can-be-a-thing-and-it-has-20m-in-sales-to-back-it-up/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Amanda Silberling reported</a>. .xyz&#8217;s strategy to align itself proactively with web3 companies could present a host of new monetization opportunities based on identity and ownership in a decentralized web as this generation of internet users stakes new claims on domains.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz runs a blog where it highlights companies, many of them web3 native, that have chosen to use its domain name ending, and cites reasons why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them opted to use it for simple logistical reasons. Defi platform Matcha </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/matchaxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the .xyz web extension gave it many more naming options, and Ethereum data tool Dune </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/dunexyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose .xyz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it allowed for a more concise web address. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

To that end, .xyz launched a class of domains known as 1.111B, which are 6- to 9-digit numerical domains available for 99 cents each year, Negari said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its convenience and accessibility, some web3 builders see .xyz as a symbolic representation of their ambitions to build a new internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We chose .xyz because it symbolizes decentralization and the new wave of Web3 applications,” Réka, the founder of decentralized autonomous organization Agora DAO, </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/agoraxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negari agrees that .xyz’s cultural significance may be one of its most important attributes, as it </span><a href="https://ceo.xyz/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represents the next generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of online innovation after the .com era. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The community is made up of hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals and small businesses who are actively breaking away from the status quo to take a stand for the future,” Negari said. “You do not have to be a non-profit organization or a commercial registrant &#8211; you can be whatever and whoever you want.”</span></p>

<p>Europe has a well-earned reputation for regulating Big Tech, taking the lead on privacy, data protection and especially competition. Now, new antitrust legislation that introduces criteria to identify large online “gatekeepers” is winding its way through the European Parliament. But while the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Markets Act</a> is expected to target a number of U.S. tech companies, if used strategically the DMA — and European antitrust and competition policy writ large — can also be a tool to compete with China.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Europe has slowly awakened to China’s challenge to transatlantic technology leadership. Although many Europeans are slowly converging on Washington’s threat perceptions, Europe still lacks the tools and political will to address challenges emanating from Beijing’s juggernauts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While transatlantic policy responses to China should be aligned, they need not be the same. The United States and Europe should leverage their respective strengths and toolboxes to combat China’s market distorting practices in the technology sphere. And Europe should bring its comparative advantage — developing and enforcing competition policy — to bear to compete with China, beginning with the DMA.<br />

<p>Beijing’s tech giants are competing for size and control of the global technology ecosystem — a dynamic the transatlantic partners cannot afford to ignore. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has set the goal of market domination for their largest technology companies. To achieve this goal, the CCP is engaged in anti-competitive behavior to improve their companies’ market positions. In addition to state subsidies, the CCP often provides sweetheart deals to companies to improve their market standing.</p>
<p>The 5G case study illustrates this dynamic. The Chinese government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-support-helped-fuel-huaweis-global-rise-11577280736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> 5G champion Huawei with $75 billion of state support through tax breaks, discounted resources and financing assistance. Meanwhile, China’s domestic market enables state-backed champions — including Huawei — to leverage very little competition and high market share within China to offer services for a fraction of the price in third countries. When faced with this reality, Europe’s leading producers of 5G technology, Nokia and Ericsson, previously struggled to compete with Huawei in their home market. Beijing’s domestic economic policy thus has global consequences.</p>
<p>In the past year, European countries have formed investment screening mechanisms to combat Beijing’s growing footprint in Europe. Yet, they still have work to do. Of the 27 member states, only 18 have <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/june/tradoc_157946.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> investment screening mechanisms, though an additional six are in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/chinese-deals-in-europe-fall-as-eu-slowly-ramps-up-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a>. There are also reasons to question the mechanism’s efficacy. The European Commission only <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40171032-f4e0-419e-addd-b1d3dc6bc606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> eight of the 265 projects they examined. Only 8% of the examined projects <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40171032-f4e0-419e-addd-b1d3dc6bc606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> Chinese projects. And they don’t explicitly tackle anti-competitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s beginning to change. In May 2021, the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> a regulation on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market, which introduces tools to investigate and potentially halt financial contributions by a non-EU government involving foreign subsidies. But while Europe’s nascent efforts are encouraging, they are not enough to address Chinese companies’ market positions and the Chinese government’s distortive policies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Europe is well positioned to leverage its regulatory momentum. Given China’s multifaceted playbook, Europe should think beyond subsidies. To effectively compete with China’s tech giants and address the unfair market position of Chinese companies, Europe must use antitrust regulations to target Chinese companies engaging in anti-competitive behavior, including by calibrating the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Pairing investment screenings with antitrust policy would give Brussels ample tools to address Beijing’s anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>Combating China’s anti-competitive behavior through antitrust policy is a logical extension of Europe’s toolkit. While the United States traditionally views antitrust policy through the lens of consumer welfare, Europe often views antitrust policy through the lens of market competition. Furthermore, Europe is often loath to view Chinese companies through a national security or anti-China frame. While investment screenings mechanisms focus on national security, antitrust and competition policy is pursued to ensure market competition in Europe. This framing makes addressing Beijing’s anti-competitive practices through antitrust policy a natural fit for Europe. In fact, last week, members of the European Parliament <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/eu-parliament-backs-tough-new-rules-rein-us-tech-giants-2021-12-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that the DMA should be extended to China’s Alibaba.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Such a move would also correct for <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgressChamber/status/1468647693182550024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived</a> anti-American bias when it comes to antitrust enforcement. Commission officials maintain that Chinese companies do not do enough business in Europe to be subject to DMA. But that approach means that American firms are targeted by European regulators almost exclusively. Yet when viewed through a geopolitical lens, China’s technology national champions pose a greater threat than U.S. technology companies to Europe’s innovation ecosystem. This continues to be a point of contention in Washington and threatens to weaken the transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p>While Europe often bristles at the United States’ anti-China framing of technology issues, moving forward with a pro-democracy affirmative agenda — Europe’s preferred framing of the challenge — requires the United States and Europe to bolster their respective innovation ecosystems. Exclusively targeting U.S. companies in the Digital Markets Act threatens to hobble potential transatlantic cooperation and hinder an affirmative transatlantic agenda.</p>
<p>While the Digital Markets Act is not wrong to keep U.S. tech companies accountable, it is an opportunity for Europe to use antitrust and competition policy to recalibrate an approach to the China challenge that fits European perceptions and strengths. Europe shouldn’t miss this opportunity to address China’s market distorting behavior and to add another tool to its toolbox to push back on China’s anti-competitive behavior.<br />
