					<description><![CDATA[Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting and improve their operational efficiency by digitizing payments to workers and suppliers instead of relying on cash.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/mobile-money-accounts-grow-to-1-2-billion-in-2020/">over 1 billion mobile money</a> accounts globally. Africa leads the way in transaction value and volume thanks to M-Pesa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used in East Africa. Other regions across the continent are also growing fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, West Africa reported the most live mobile money services in any region, with 56 million active accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Ivory Coast, one of Francophone Africa&#8217;s largest mobile money markets, 75% of the population own a mobile money account, compared to 20% who own bank accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference is staggering and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the region&#8217;s huge appetite for the service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While telecom operators have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated mobile money services across most of sub-Saharan Africa, a few startups are trying to change the mobile money experience for customers. Ivory Coast-based fintech startup <a href="https://julaya.co/">Julaya</a> is one such company, and today, it announced a $2 million pre-Series A funding to expand its products across West Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 by <a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/mathiasleopoldie">Mathias Léopoldie</a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/charles-talbot-b1b43784">Charles Talbot</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before launching Julaya, they worked at French payment fintech LemonWay on their service in Mali and Burkina Faso</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Léopoldie told TechCrunch that the experience introduced them to how mobile money worked across Francophone Africa. LemonWay acts as a payment solution for marketplaces. So, while working on expanding the fintech&#8217;s service in both countries, the pair noticed the massive potential businesses had to reach the unbanked via the large consumer penetration of telecom operators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to digitize trade payments but started in the Ivory Coast instead of Mali and Burkina Faso. The platform enables companies to streamline their accounting and improve their operational efficiency by digitizing payments to workers and suppliers instead of relying on cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company helps African businesses and institutions disburse payments to mobile money and mobile banking wallets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It achieves this by working with telecom operators and other fintech startups in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mobile money is coming to a mature stage where business and public institution use-cases provide new growth opportunities for the sector. The pandemic has opened up minds about the urge to digitize payments. Fintech competition in West Africa is making digital finance more affordable for consumers, and technical integrations with telecom operators are becoming more reliable,” Talbot said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, these partnerships haven&#8217;t come without their own share of challenges. For one, payments technology in Francophone Africa remains quite fragmented, and APIs from telecoms are still burgeoning and somewhat unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Léopoldie added that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges come from distribution channels, making it difficult for the company to sell en masse at a cheap cost, as well as from the untrustworthiness of businesses toward digitized payments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Ivory Coast, a wire transfer takes between one to three days, and you always have to check with your bank branch as a customer. … Businesses do not trust digital experiences as they often have shortcomings, and educating the market bears a high cost on acquisition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, talents that have a startup mindset are still difficult to find,&#8221; Léopoldie said of some of the challenges facing the three-year-old startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2182901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/julaya-browser@2x.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, the startup, which has an R&amp;D and technical team in France, has bagged customers from SMBs and large corporates to government institutions. The company says it&#8217;s currently processing over $1.5 million monthly for 50 of these customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, SODECI, Ministry of Education, Ivory Coast and the World Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julaya closed a pre-seed investment of $250,000 in 2018 and a seed investment of $550,000 a year later, all from angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the company has introduced VC firms in its pre-Series A round. They include corporate venture capital firms Orange Ventures and MFS Africa Frontiers; VC firms Saviu Ventures, Launch Africa and 50 Partners Capital; and some angel investors in Africa and Europe. Julaya will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to broaden its market share in Ivory Coast and launch digital payment products and expand across West Africa.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 20 million people use Orange as a mobile money service across 15 African countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The telecom operator also recently launched a mobile banking platform in Ivory Coast and has surpassed 500,000 users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, what&#8217;s the rationale behind this strategic investment, which marks <a href="https://ventures.orange.com/portfolio/?location%5B%5D=MEA">its third check</a> in an African fintech startup after South Africa&#8217;s Yoco and Senegal&#8217;s SudPay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fintech’s environment in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is distinguished by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its competitiveness and strong dynamism. Orange Group, through its technology investment fund, intends to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this boom by supporting fintechs such as Julaya. The goal is to target local technology champions at the service of the transition to a more digital and responsible world,” said Habib Bamba, the director of Transformation, digital and media at Orange Ivory Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange, other telecom operators, fintechs and banks remain big competitors to Julaya. So h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ow does it plan to stay on top of people&#8217;s minds across the region? Léopoldie thinks that focusing on the best user experience might do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This sounds like an overheard statement, but we understand that what the customer values most is reliable customer support and a predictable and smooth online experience, for instance, a reliable platform with very little downtime,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even if you only have a 90% success rate on your transactions, as long as you give this information in a transparent communication to the customer, they will trust you.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">In Bangladesh, students often rely on after school learning centers for study help or test preparation, but many of the best ones are concentrated in major cities. Edtech startup <a href="https://shikho.tech/">Shikho</a> was created to make supplementary education more accessible and affordable. The company announced today it has closed a $1.3 million seed round co-led by returning investor LearnStart (the seed fund of edtech investment firm Learn Capital) and Anchorless Bangladesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The round also included participation from Wavemaker Partners and Ankur Nagpal, founder and chief executive officer of online course platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/edtech-notches-a-win-as-teachable-is-acquired-by-hotmart/">Teachable</a>. Shikho’s last round of funding was $275,000 in pre-seed financing last year from LearnStart and strategic angel investors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Founded in April 2019, Shikho is focused on grades 9, 10, 11 and 12, with plans to introduce content for grades 6 up to university level and continuous education. Its learning material, created by educators and subject experts, is based on the Bangladeshi National Curriculum. To keep students engaged, it uses gamification techniques, like points, leaderboards and virtual awards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">Shikho was founded in April 2019 by CEO Shahir Chowdhury, who previously worked in finance and business, including as a director at HSBC UK’s Private Bank, and chief operating officer Zeeshan Zakaria, who also worked in finance before becoming a mathematics teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Both grew up in Dhaka before moving to the United Kingdom, where they went to university. Chowdhury told TechCrunch that even while working in finance, his goal was to launch a socially impactful business in Bangladesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian edtech startup Gredu raises $4M Series A to keep teachers, parents and students engaged with one another&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/indonesian-edtech-startup-gredu-raises-4m-series-a-to-keep-teachers-parents-and-students-engaged-with-one-another/embed/#?secret=ldVU9JZNwJ" data-secret="ldVU9JZNwJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">At first, Chowdhury looked at fintech because of his career experience, but realized there were already many players focused on financial inclusion in Bangladesh, like bKash. He started thinking about education&#8211;Chowdhury’s father is a retired professor and his mother still teaches high school. Then by coincidence, he worked on a client report about the emergence of Indian and Chinese edtech startups, like Byju&#8217;s and Toppr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I tried to understand what edtech was and why it was working in those markets and why it didn’t exist in Bangladesh,” said Chowdhury. “When I looked at that closely, there was no reason for it not to exist in Bangladesh. From an macroeconomic perspective, you have all the elements you need. You have a very large population, about 165 million people, and half of that is under the age of 25.”</p>
<p class="p3">Chowdhury reached out to Zakaria to lead Shikho’s academic programming. Shikho’s goal is to find more engaging and effective ways to teach students material from the Bangladesh National Curriculum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Not much has changed since my dad was in grade 10 in terms of the syllabus,” said Zakaria. “I’m not a politician, so I can’t bring about change there, but I can change how it’s delivered. We deliver the curriculum in a way that has never been seen before in terms of the pedagogical experience.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Shikho launched about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic began, but that didn’t change its approach to product development because it was always meant to be an online learning platform.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The company works with educators to create content, including animated videos that break down topics into short segments of about six minutes each to help students learn at their own pace. Each video is supplemented with digital resources called smart notes to replace the guidebooks many students buy for studying, and practice questions with detailed solutions.</p>
<p class="p3">Shikho’s main video content is pre-recorded, but it will also launch live classes for its app and web portal in about six weeks. The company’s new funding will allow it to scale-up content production, including an app for parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">One of the biggest challenges for online learning platforms is keeping students motivated. Chowdhury said Shikho’s gamification system was inspired by the Nike Run Club app. Similar to how Nike Run Club users get points every time they go on a run, Shikho gives students points when they log in, do a test or watch a video. The points can be collected for milestones ranging from beginner to “legend,” and special badges are awarded for accomplishments like finishing a test quickly and accurately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The point system also feeds into a leaderboard, so students can see how many points they have compared to other Shikho users at their school, or on the entire app.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The app is free to use for seven days. One of the company’s plans for its new funding is to launch more freemium content to increase user conversions into paying customers. Chowdhury says that paying users have high engagement rates, typically spending about 45 to 50 minutes daily in the app. Shikho plans to double-down on its user acquisition strategy, including offline sales teams in front of schools, at the end of the year after launching its app for parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Students are the users and the actual customers are their parents, so we’re conscious that we’re going to have to flip communication to the parents,” said Chowdhury. “That’s part of what this funding round is for.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">In statement about investment, Anchorless Bangladesh founding partner and CEO Rahat Ahmed said, “Bangladesh has one of the largest allocations of private education expenditure as a percentage of disposable income in the world, but lags behind countries like India and Indonesia when it comes to edtech funding. The market is primed for growth and we believe the team at Shikho is well-fit to lead the charge and take education to the next level.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For fleet managers, managing shipping crew changes across different countries is an elaborate process even in the best of times—and now is definitely not the best of times. <a href="https://grey-wing.com/">Greywing</a>, a Y Combinator-backed platform for automating maritime operations, launched a new solution today that it describes as an industry-first. Called Crew Change, it is used to help shipping companies manage testing, quarantine and other COVID-19 regulations for their crew members.</p>
<p>Crew Change draws on data from <a href="http://s5agencyworld.com/">S5 Agency World</a>, a global port agency, to keep on top of quarantine, testing and vaccination requirements, which are constantly changing. Greywing co-founder and chief executive officer Nick Clarke says Crew Change can potentially save fleet managers millions of dollars by streamlining crew changes, finding the most cost-effective flights for transporting crew, planning routes (or rerouting if necessary) and reducing delays, which have a trickle-down effect on the rest of the supply chain.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freightify lands $2.5M to make rate management easier for freight forwarders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/freightify-lands-2-5m-to-make-rate-management-easier-for-freight-forwarders/embed/#?secret=dhVohheL6M" data-secret="dhVohheL6M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Greywing’s other solutions help fleet operators manage important tasks, like assessing sea routes for piracy risks and transporting crew to ships. Clarke told TechCrunch in an email that the company was originally created to help the maritime industry to mitigate risks in the Gulf of Guinea and offshore Somalia, which have <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-piracy-increasing-on-the-gulf-of-guinea/a-56637925">high rates of piracy</a>, by delivering rapid intelligence about those shipping lanes.</p>
<p>“We discovered that by going beyond this, we could deliver intelligence on where their crew could disembark to solve what was top of mind for seafarers—getting home to their families,” he said.</p>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started, Greywing started getting requests from clients who urgently needed help to manage crew changes. “They had personnel trapped on vessels unable to get on and off all over the world. My co-founder Hrishi [Olickel] and I examined the problem and seeing the growing complexity of global lockdowns, realized it was a problem that was here to stay.”</p>

<p>Crew managers have to stay on top of changing immigration restrictions in hundreds of countries and thousands of ports around the world, Clarke added. To complicate things further, many crews include members of different nationalities, who are often subject to different restrictions.</p>
<p>Much of the crew change process is analog. For example, a manager of a vessel chartered to a third-party may only find out its next destination by emailing the ship’s captain. Crew changes are often planned through spreadsheets, and flight bookings are done through email or phone.</p>
<p>“Even before the pandemic, crew change management was a classic problem that has always been hard to navigate, but with a few more levels of consideration added to that data at random, it became totally impractical for even a team of humans to make sense of,” said Clarke.</p>

<p>Greywing was able to create Crew Change by making small changes to its piracy risk mitigation methodology, and it is now integrated into CRY4, Greywing’s risk reporting solution.</p>
<p>The company worked with S5 Agency World because it “is regarded as one of the leading global port agencies which services port offices worldwide,” Clarke said. “What that means is their data is able to give us a clear picture of what’s happening on the ground so shipping owners can better predict and manage what’s happening on the seas.” Crew Change also uses data from 30 other public and private data APIs and is planning to add another 20 data sources.</p>
<p>Thanks to its wide range of data sources, Clarke said that Crew Change is able to update information about visa, quarantine and testing requirements in as little as 15 minutes (or a day for more complex data).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may well recognize Cassie as the basis of Agility Robotics’ delivery bot, Digit. If you’ve been following the tech’s progression at all, however, you no doubt know that it started life as the ostrich-inspired Cassie. The robot is all legs and not much else.</p>
<p>In addition to fueling Agility’s commercial ambitions, the robot has proven a solid platform for exploring bipedal location. Announced by Oregon State University professor Jonathan Hunt in 2017, Cassie was created with the aim of a $1 million grant from the DoD — a pretty familiar story in the robotics world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2182842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OSU-Bipedal-Robot-First-to-Run-5K.2021-07-27-17_42_07.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, a team from the Dynamics Robotics Laboratory in OSU’s College of Engineering highlighted the ways they’re continuing to push Cassie to its bipedal limits. The team says the robot was able to run a 5K untethered, on a single charge. Cassie’s not going to beat any human world records anytime soon, but the 53-minute (and three second) run was still an impressive exhibition for the tech.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSaSjd_HOaI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The robot’s run time included around 6.5 minutes of troubleshooting, as the team dealt with an overheated computer and a botched turn that knocked it off its legs.</p>
<p>“Cassie is a very efficient robot because of how it has been designed and built, and we were really able to reach the limits of the hardware and show what it can do,” Ph.D. student Jeremy Dao said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the team, Cassie essentially taught itself to run using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which allowed the system to figure out how to stay upright by shifting its balance while running.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPhEmC6b6XU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful method in AI that opens up skills like running, skipping and walking up and down stairs,” undergrad student Yesh Godse adds.</p>
<p>In May of this year, the OSU team also demonstrated how Cassie can walk up and down stairs without the aid of lidar or on-board cameras.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 27, 2021. Today is a good day not only because the U.S. women’s national soccer team is heading to the Olympics quarter finals (shoutout <a href="https://www.gothamfc.com/10-carli-lloyd">Gotham’s Carli Lloyd</a>!), but also because Danny Crichton just published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">an incredibly interesting EC-1 digging into RapidSOS</a>. Danny has previously written extensively about disaster tech, a growth industry of sorts given the changing climate. OK, now to tech news! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/"><strong>Edtech’s shifting center of gravity:</strong></a> The debris is still settling after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">China’s recent regulatory changes</a> impacted edtech, on-demand and music-streaming businesses in the country. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> dug into the edtech market, asking investors where they planned to invest in the future. The gist is that while China was once the center of the edtech universe, it may rapidly lose that crown to a more global set of edtech hotspots.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/"><strong>Africa’s burgeoning startup ecosystem:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">long-running dive into the Q2 venture capital market</a> is coming to a close this week, but not before we investigated the African startup market, a growing space that is attracting more and more investor and media attention. Some big exits certainly haven’t hurt. But while capital raised by African startups is growing rapidly, some blank spaces still exist. Let’s see if investors pounce.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/no-code-bubble-series-a/">No-code is still super hot:</a> </strong>If you want to have a weird day on Twitter, tweet that you don’t like no-code as a concept. You will get many notes from folks who disagree. That passion among the hoi polloi is also reflected in investor interest. This time ‘round the funding tree it’s Bubble, which just closed a $100 million round to help anyone “begin building modern web applications using a click-and-drag interface that can connect data sources and other software together in one fluid interface,” per our reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off today’s startup notes, let’s talk about stock. Startup shares, to be precise. Mostly investors get preferred shares, because they can demand better equity as they are bringing capital to the table. Founders and staff tend to get common stock. Which, as the name implies, is not as good as preferred. But there’s a venture capital firm in Boston called Pillar VC that buys common stock in its investments. One of its investors, Jamie Goldstein, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/what-ive-learned-after-5-years-of-buying-common-stock-in-startups/">wrote an essay for TechCrunch</a> sharing what he’s learned from the process. It’s worth reading.</p>
<p>Before we get into funding rounds, NowRx CEO and co-founder Cary Breese <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/same-day-delivery-apps-need-more-than-speed-to-survive-post-pandemic/">wrote an op-ed for TechCrunch</a> discussing the delivery market. Given how much money is flowing into so-called instant grocery startups, it’s also worth your time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/wiliot-raises-200m-as-it-preps-a-saas-pivot-licensing-its-ultra-light-ambient-power-chip-technology-to-third-parties/"><strong>$200M for sensors as a service:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Wiliot, which has just put a bunch of SoftBank Vision Fund 2 money into its pockets to turn its “ultra thin and light” processor that “runs on ambient power” into a service that it can sell to others. Very cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/crypto-infrastructure-provider-fireblocks-raises-310m-triples-valuation-to-2-2b-in-five-months/"><strong>Meet the latest crypto unicorn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s Fireblocks — with its new $310 million round, the company is now worth $2.2 billion. What does it do? According to our own reporting, Fireblocks “aims to offer financial institutions an all-in-one platform to run a digital asset business, providing them with infrastructure to store, transfer and issue digital assets.” Between this and the recent FTX deal, it’s clear that there is still ample investor appetite for continued crypto wagers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/"><strong>1Password raises $100M more:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Accel is at it again, putting big checks into largely self-sustaining businesses This time it’s a double down on 1Password, a software service that helps individuals and businesses alike create and manage supersecure passwords. The company competes with LastPass, among other companies. The company is now worth $2 billion and recently crossed the $120 million ARR milestone. That’s pretty darn good, even if the company’s revenue multiple implies that it is no longer growing at startup speeds. (How about an S-1? Anyone?)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/oova-raises-1-2m-to-develop-a-better-at-home-kit-for-detecting-a-womans-best-time-to-conceive/"><strong>Oova wants to help people conceive:</strong></a> The startup just landed a $1.2 million round to help folks figure out their optimum fertility window and provide information that their healthcare provider may be able to use to confirm ovulation. There are two groups of people in the world. Those who have not dealt with fertility-related issues, and those who have. For the latter set, Oona’s newly released kit and goals are good news.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The RapidSOS EC-1</h2>
<p>According to one estimate, Americans place 240 million 911 calls each year.</p>
<p>Sending emergency services to the right location sounds straightforward, but each call is routed through one of thousands of call centers known as public safety answering points (PSAPs).</p>
<p>“Every 911 center is very different and they are as diverse and unique as the communities that they serve,” said Karin Marquez, senior director of public safety at RapidSOS.</p>
<p>One PSAP that serves New York City is a 450,000-square-foot, blast-resistant cube set on nine acres, but “you have agencies in rural America that have one person working 24/7 and they’re there to answer three calls a day,” Marquez noted.</p>
<p>Founded eight years ago, RapidSOS processes more than 150 million emergencies each year across approximately 5,000 PSAPs. The company&#8217;s technology helps call centers integrate requests from cell phones, landlines and IoT devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its technology is almost certainly integrated into the smartphone you’re carrying and many of the devices you have lying around,&#8221; Managing Editor Danny Crichton writes in a four-part series that studies the company&#8217;s origins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-origin/">Part 1</a>: The early years and why a consumer app company turned to govtech and integrated services for technology and device companies.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-business/">Part 2</a>: How RapidSOS made its pivot and why its current business model has performed so well.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-partnerships/">Part 3</a>: To transform 911 services, RapidSOS established dozens of corporate and individual partnerships.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-future/">Part 4</a>: Examines the future of 911 and RapidSOS in light of limited infrastructure funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve honestly never met a company like RapidSOS with so many signed partnerships,&#8221; says Danny, who initially wrote about the firm six years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s closed dozens of partnerships and business development deals, and with some of the biggest names in tech. How does it do it? This story is about how it built a successful BD engine.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">excellent quarter for Apple</a>, as the company posted $81.4 billion in revenue. That’s a 36% year-over-year jump for the company, besting Wall Street estimates of $73.3 billion by a considerable margin.</p>
<p>“Our record June quarter operating performance included new revenue records in each of our geographic segments, double-digit growth in each of our product categories, and a new all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” CFO Luca Maestri said in a release. “We generated $21 billion of operating cash flow, returned nearly $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter, and continued to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.”</p>
<p>Some strong figures for the company all around here, but it was iPhone sales and subscription services that continued to lead the way — a familiar story for anyone who’s followed the company the last several quarters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>iPhone sales increased from $26 billion to $39.5 billion, on the continued strength of the company’s long-waited push into linewide 5G, while services rose from $13.1 billion to $17.5 billion for the quarter. Apple has continued to grow its services offerings, which now includes Music, TV+, iCloud, Arcade, News+ and Fitness+. The company clearly sees the subscription portfolio as the future of its revenue model.</p>
<p>Greater China proved a strong market for the company in the third fiscal quarter. The company posted $14.76 billion in sales for the region, a more than 50% increase over the same time last year. The Americas region, meanwhile, rose from $ 27 billion to $35.89.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the earnings report, CEO Tim Cook made reference to pandemic-related issues, which highlighting broader societal focuses for the company.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This quarter, our teams built on a period of unmatched innovation by sharing powerful new products with our users, at a time when using technology to connect people everywhere has never been more important,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re continuing to press forward in our work to infuse everything we make with the values that define us — by inspiring a new generation of developers to learn to code, moving closer to our 2030 environment goal, and engaging in the urgent work of building a more equitable future.</p>
<p>The company once again declined to offer guidance, owing to uncertainties during the pandemic. On a followup call with investors, however, Maestri noted, &#8220;We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June Quarter.&#8221; The CFO cited various issues including foreign exchange rates with the U.S. dollar, a slow down in the growth rate of services and continued supply chain issues for its hardware offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell amidst a deluge of major technology company earnings reports, Alphabet <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=4db52a1">reported its own second-quarter performance</a>. The search-and-services company posted revenues of $61.9 billion in the June 30, 2021 quarter, net income of $18.5 billion, and earnings per share of $27.26. Those figures work out to top-line growth of 62%, and net income expansion of 166%. Naturally Google is currently being compared to pandemic-impacted Q2 2020 results, but its gains are noteworthy regardless.</p>
<p>The Android-maker&#8217;s results trounced expectations, with the street <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/analysis?p=GOOG">only expecting</a> Google&#8217;s parent company to post $56 billion in total top line and $19.14 in earnings per share. Notably Alphabet shares are up around a single percentage point after hours, mirroring a similarly muted market reaction to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">better than officially anticipated earnings results from Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>Alphabet is a company with a number of moving parts, so let&#8217;s unpack the numbers a little bit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s reported revenue of $7 billion is up 84% year over year. This feels like a strong result, frankly, given YouTube&#8217;s age. That said, your humble servant wonders how much heavier the ad load can get on YouTube before a rival service steals some of its oxygen. In a separate note, YouTube disclosed that its YouTube Shorts product has &#8220;surpassed 15 billion global daily views,&#8221; up 131% from the 6.5 billion global daily views that it detailed in March. (Everyone wants to eat TikTok, it seems.)</p>
<p>Google Cloud reported revenue of $4.6 billion, up 54% year over year. That growth rate is slightly above what Microsoft posted for its Azure cloud unit. However, as the Microsoft effort is considered to be larger than Google&#8217;s own in revenue terms, investors might have anticipated a larger growth ∆ than what Mountain View just detailed. Google Cloud cut its operating loss from $1.4 billion in the year-ago Q2 to a far more modest $591 million deficit in its most recent quarter. That&#8217;s honestly rather good.</p>
<p>On the Other Bets side of things, revenues rose! But so did losses. The skunkworks group at Alphabet posted $192 million in revenue, up from $148 million in the year-ago period. But the collection of trials and errors lost $1.4 billion in the quarter, up from $1.1 billion in the corresponding year-ago period.</p>
<p>Naturally with operating income of $19.4 billion <em>inclusive</em> of its Other Bets cost center, Alphabet can well afford to continue spending on what projects that may in time generate material future revenues.</p>
<p>Still, everything at Alphabet that is not Google&#8217;s core offerings (search, YouTube, etc.) lost money in the quarter:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182812" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182812" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182812 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png" alt="" width="710" height="195" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png?resize=150,41 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png?resize=300,82 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png?resize=680,187 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-4.47.41-PM.png?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182812" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet</p></div></p>
<p>The real story, however, is in the epic gains that Alphabet posted in operating income from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021. Just look at that acceleration in operating income! It&#8217;s a somewhat befuddling result in terms of its quality.</p>
<p>What else to take note of? Google&#8217;s share repurchase program has been modified some, but not in a manner that should impact regular investors. So we can leave Alphabet&#8217;s quarter content that the company did well enough to defend its market cap of just over $1.75 trillion, even if it did not manage to add too much to the figure in after-hours trading thus far.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great time to be a huge tech company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the world’s biggest video game companies is reeling after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/22/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism/">state discrimination and sexual harassment suit</a> kicked off a firestorm of controversy within the company. California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Activision Blizzard last week, alleging that the company fostered a “breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.”</p>
<p>Following a combative response to the lawsuit from corporate leadership, a group of employees at Blizzard will <a href="https://blizzardwatch.com/2021/07/27/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-heres-list-demands-corporate-leadership/">stage a walkout</a>, which is planned for Wednesday at 10 a.m. PDT. Most employees at Blizzard continue to work remotely, but walkout participants will gather tomorrow at the gates to the company’s Irvine campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given last week’s statements from Activision Blizzard, Inc. and their legal counsel regarding the DFEH lawsuit, as well as the subsequent internal statement from Frances Townsend, and the many stories shared by current and former employees of Activision Blizzard since, we believe that our values as employees are not being accurately reflected in the words and actions of our leadership,&#8221; the organizers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the new statement, they called for supporters to donate to organizations including <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>, the anti-sexual-violence organization <a href="https://www.rainn.org/">RAINN</a> and <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard publishes some of the biggest titles in gaming, including the Call of Duty franchise, World of Warcraft, Starcraft and Overwatch. Blizzard came under Activision’s wing through a 2008 merger and the subsidiary operates out of its own Irvine, California headquarters.</p>
<p>In the suit, the state agency describes a “frat house” atmosphere in which women are not only not afforded the same opportunities as their male counterparts, but are routinely and openly harassed, sometimes by their superiors.</p>
<p>The company pushed back last week in a fiery statement, blaming “unaccountable state bureaucrats that are driving many of the state’s best businesses out of California” for pursuing the lawsuit. Activision Blizzard Executive Vice President Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to George W. Bush, echoed that aggressive messaging in an internal memo, slamming the lawsuit as a “distorted and untrue picture of our company.”</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blizzardwatch.com/2021/07/26/open-letter-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-lawsuit/">open letter published Monday</a>, the walkout’s organizers condemned Blizzard&#8217;s response to the lawsuit’s allegations. &#8220;We believe these statements have damaged our ongoing quest for equality inside and outside of our industry,” they wrote. “ … These statements make it clear that our leadership is not putting our values first.”</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://blizzardwatch.com/2021/07/27/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-heres-list-demands-corporate-leadership/">2,600 employees signed the letter</a>, which demands an end to mandatory arbitration clauses that “protect abusers and limit the ability of victims to seek restitution,” improved representation and opportunities for women and nonbinary employees, salary transparency and a full audit of diversity, equity and inclusion at the company.</p>
<p>On Twitter, streamers, gamers, game devs and former employees expressed support for Wednesday&#8217;s walkout under the hashtag #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23actiblizzwalkout&amp;src=typeahead_click">ActiBlizzWalkout</a>, with some calling for a blackout on Activision Blizzard games as a show of solidarity. Others called for streamers to use the walkout time slot to raise awareness about rampant sexual harassment and discrimination in gaming culture at large.</p>
<p>One Blizzard employee shared a photo of the company’s <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/21349313/the-orc-statue">iconic statue</a> depicting an axe-wielding orc, a central feature of its Irvine headquarters. Three plaques displaying corporate values that surround the statue had been covered with paper: “Lead responsibly,” &#8220;play nice, play fair,” and “every voice matters.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a four-part series, Managing Editor Danny Crichton tells the story of RapidSOS, the company that processes more than half of all 911 calls made each year in the U.S.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to one estimate, Americans call 911 about 240 million times every year.</p>
<p>Sending emergency services to the right location sounds straightforward, but each 911 call is routed through one of thousands of call centers known as public safety answering points (PSAPs).</p>
<p>“Every 911 center is very different and they are as diverse and unique as the communities that they serve,” said Karin Marquez, senior director of public safety at RapidSOS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One PSAP that serves New York City is a 450,000-square-foot, blast-resistant cube set on nine acres, but you also have &#8220;agencies in rural America that have one person working 24/7 and they’re there to answer three calls a day,” Marquez noted.</p>
<p>Founded eight years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">RapidSOS processes more than 150 million emergencies each year</a> across approximately 5,000 PSAPs. The company&#8217;s technology helps call centers integrate requests from cell phones, landlines and IoT devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its technology is almost certainly integrated into the smartphone you’re carrying and many of the devices you have lying around,&#8221; Managing Editor Danny Crichton writes in a four-part series that studies the company&#8217;s origins and ensuing success:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve honestly never met a company like RapidSOS with so many signed partnerships,&#8221; says Danny, who initially wrote about the firm six years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s closed dozens of partnerships and business development deals, and with some of the biggest names in tech. How does it do it? This story is about how it built a successful BD engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The headlines might be littered with mega deals, IPOs and SPACs, but in all likelihood, you will exit your startup via a relatively smaller merger or acquisition, Ben Boissevain writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“The IPO market is healthy again, but M&amp;A still represents 88% of exits: So far this year, there were 503 IPOs and 5,203 deals,” writes Boissevain, founder of Ascento Capital.</p>
<p>“While it is good to strive for a billion-dollar-plus sale, a successful IPO or a SPAC deal, it is practical to prepare your startup for a smaller transaction.”</p>

<p>U.S. edtech company Duolingo bumped up its IPO price range Monday morning, targeting $95 to $100 per share, up from previous guidance of $85 to $95 per share.</p>
<p>“The fact that Duolingo is raising its IPO price range indicates that we are more likely on the path for a strong offering than a weak one,” Alex Wilhelm notes.</p>

<p>Many Extra Crunch readers will not have heard of China&#8217;s fastest-growing bottled beverage company: Genki Forest is a direct-to-consumer startup that started selling its sodas, milk teas and other products just five years ago.</p>
<p>Today, its products are available in 40 countries and the company hopes to generate revenue of $1.2 billion in 2021. After closing its latest funding round, Genki Forest is valued at $6 billion.</p>
<p>Industry watchers frequently compare the upstart to giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, but founder Binsen Tang comes from a tech background, having funded ELEX Technology, a social gaming company that found success internationally.</p>
<p>“China doesn’t need any more good platforms,” Tang told his team in 2015, “but it does need good products.”</p>
<p>Leveraging China&#8217;s robust distribution network, lighting-fast manufacturing capabilities and a vast pool of data that enables holistic digitization, Genki Forest sells more than 30% of its products online.</p>
<p>“Everything feels right about the company,&#8221; said VC investor Anna Fang. &#8220;The space, the founder, the products and the back end … they exemplify the new Chinese consumer brand.“</p>

<p>Sequoia’s Mike Vernal joined us on TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising to discuss how founders should approach product-market fit, with a specific focus on tempo.</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn’t mean fast in the kind of uncontrolled, reckless, crashing sense. It means fast in a sort of consistent, maniacal, get-a-little-bit-better-each-day kind of way. And it’s actually one of the top things that we look for, at least when evaluating a team: How consistently fast they move.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex Wilhelm spent the end of last week and the beginning of this one looking at Chinese regulations targeting its edtech sector, aiming to understand “precisely what is going on with the various regulatory changes.”</p>
<p>“For startups, the regulatory changes aren’t a death blow; indeed, many Chinese tech startups won’t be affected by what we’ve seen thus far,” he writes. “But on the whole, it feels like the risk profile of doing business in China has risen.”</p>

<p>Startups developing so-called deep tech often find it challenging to raise capital for various reasons.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, two experienced investors, SOSV partners Pae Wu and Garrett Winther, spoke on the subject and advised startups facing a challenging fundraising path.</p>

<p>Processing payments, credit and authorizations for B2B purchases is all handled electronically, but that&#8217;s not a panacea.</p>
<p>For example, volume sellers prefer to work through traditional accounts payable systems instead of paying the service fees smaller companies accept as the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>However, the combination of fraud and identity protection with credit handling and digital payments &#8220;creates a powerful network, the type that can not only build trust but enable one-click transactions at scale,&#8221; says Andrew Steele, an investor at Activant Capital.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don’t think you need to limit advice from people who are “been there, done that.” I think it is really important to get input from those people, but in terms of personal development, I think you want insight from people who understand how human beings listen and learn and grow.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Microsoft shares fell after the news, perhaps due to its results missing so-called whisper numbers; that it has traded at or near all-time highs recently puts the 3% after-hours drop into context.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, Microsoft reported <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q4/press-release-webcast">its fiscal Q4 2021 earnings</a>, the period corresponding to the second calendar quarter of this year. Microsoft posted revenues of $46.2 billion in the period, along with net income of $16.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.17. The company&#8217;s revenues grew by 21% compared to the year-ago quarter, while its net income expanded by a more toothsome 47% over the same time frame.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s results beat expectations, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/analysis?p=MSFT">Yahoo Finance reports</a> were revenues of $44.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.90. Shares of the software giant fell after the news, perhaps due to the company&#8217;s results missing so-called whisper numbers; that Microsoft has traded at or near all-time highs in recent sessions puts the current 3% after-hours drop into context. Tech shares were broadly weaker in regular trading today, a session in which Microsoft shed just under 1% of its worth.</p>
<p>Microsoft is so large a company that its top-level results are hardly clear, so let&#8217;s dig in a little more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First up, Azure, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing platform, posted 51% revenue growth in the quarter compared to the corresponding year-ago quarter, a figure that would dip to 45% if one was to remove currency fluctuations, according to the company. The 51% figure, <a href="https://twitter.com/EPro/status/1420113207532785670">per initial analysis</a>, is the company&#8217;s best Azure growth result since its fiscal Q3 2020 quarter, or the first calendar quarter of last year.</p>
<p>From that perspective, it&#8217;s hard to fault Azure&#8217;s growth over the last three months.</p>
<p>Picking through the rest of the company&#8217;s results, we can rank its three main divisions&#8217; revenue growth results as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligent Cloud: 30% growth, a figure driven in part by Azure&#8217;s growth.</li>
<li>Productivity and Business Processes: 21% growth, led by LinkedIn (46% growth), and the Dynamics 365 CRM product (49% growth).</li>
<li>More Personal Computing: 9% growth, led by search growth (53%, excluding traffic acquisition costs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The weaker spots in the larger Redmond revenue review are not hard to spot. Office Consumer revenue expanded by 18%, a figure that feels somewhat modest; Windows OEM revenue slipped by 3%; and Surface revenue fell 20%.</p>
<p>But those lowlights were not enough to derail the company&#8217;s aggregate growth picture and titanic profitability. How profitable is Satya Nadella&#8217;s company? Microsoft spent $10.4 billion on share buybacks and dividends in its most recent quarter. That&#8217;s a somewhat confusing amount of money, frankly. And at this point, we&#8217;re a bit flummoxed why Microsoft is buying back shares. Its market capitalization is a bit more than $2 trillion, implying that at best the company can gently chip away at its share count over time at huge expense. Surely there is a better use for its cash?</p>
<p>Regardless, the company&#8217;s results indicate that the recent run of big technology companies posting impressively large and lucrative results is not behind us. That may help provide investor confidence for technology companies more broadly. Which, you know, would not be a bad thing for startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">acquisition spree</a> continues today as the company announces it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring">acqui-hired</a> the team from news aggregator and summary app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1475186118?mt=8">Brief</a>. The startup from former Google engineers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/briefs-mobile-news-app-aims-to-tackle-information-overload-and-media-bias/">launched last year</a> to offer a subscription-based news summary app that aimed to tackle many of the problems with today&#8217;s news cycle, including information overload, burnout, media bias and algorithms that promoted engagement over news accuracy.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to share deal terms.</p>
<p>Before starting Brief, co-founder and CEO Nick Hobbs was a Google product manager who had worked on AR, Google Assistant, Google’s mobile app, and self-driving cars, among other things. Co-founder and CTO Andrea Huey, meanwhile, was a Google senior software engineer, who worked on the Google iOS app and had a prior stint at Microsoft.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2015809" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2015809" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2015809 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recent-Bulletins.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2015809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brief</p></div></p>
<p>While Brief&#8217;s ambitious project to fix news consumption showed a lot of promise, its growth may have been hampered by the subscription model it had adopted. The app required a $4.99 per month commitment, despite not having the brand-name draw of a more traditional news outlet. For comparison, The New York Times&#8217; basic digital subscription is currently just $4 per week for the first year of service, thanks to a promotion.</p>
<p>Twitter says the startup&#8217;s team, which also includes two other Brief employees, will join Twitter&#8217;s Experience.org group where they&#8217;ll work on areas that support the public conversation on Twitter, including Twitter Spaces and Explore.</p>
<p>While Twitter wouldn&#8217;t get into specifics as to what those tasks may involve, the company did tell TechCrunch it hopes to leverage the founders&#8217; expertise with Brief to build out and accelerate projects in both those areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/explore">Explore</a>, of course, is Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;news&#8221; section, where top stories across categories are aggregated alongside trending topics. But what it currently lacks is a comprehensive approach to distilling the news down to the basic facts and presenting balance, as Brief&#8217;s app had offered. Instead, Twitter&#8217;s news items include a headline and a short description of the story, followed by notable tweets. There&#8217;s certainly room for improvement there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to imagine some sort of news-focused product built into Twitter&#8217;s own subscription service, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> &#8212; but that&#8217;s just speculation at this point.</p>
<p>Twitter says it proactively reached out to Brief with its offer. As part of its current M&amp;A strategy, the company is on the hunt for acquiring talent that will complement its existing teams and help to accelerate its product developments.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Twitter has made similar acqui-hires, including those for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">distraction-free reading service Scroll</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">social podcasting app Breaker</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/"> social screen-sharing app Squad</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/twitter-acquihires-team-from-reshuffle-to-work-on-its-api-platform/">API integration platform Reshuffle</a>. It also bought products, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">newsletter platform Revue</a>, which it directly integrated. The company even held acquisition talks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/twitter-said-to-have-held-acquisition-talks-with-clubhouse-on-potential-4b-deal/">with Clubhouse</a> and India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">ShareChat</a>, which would have been much larger M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re really glad we ended up at Twitter,&#8221; Hobbs told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrea and I founded Brief to build news that fostered a healthy discourse, and Twitter’s genuine commitment to improve the public conversation is deeply inspiring,&#8221; he said. &#8220;While we can’t discuss specifics on future plans, we’re confident our experience at Brief will help accelerate the many exciting things happening at Twitter today,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Hobbs said the team remains optimistic about the future of paid journalism, too, as Brief demonstrated that some customers would pay for a new and improved news experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brief pioneered a fresh vision for journalism, focused on getting you just the news you need rather than as much as you could withstand,&#8221; remarked Ilya Kirnos, founding partner and CTO at SignalFire, who backed Brief at the seed stage. &#8220;That respect for its readers made SignalFire proud to support founders Nick Hobbs and Andrea Huey, who are now bringing that philosophy to the top source of breaking news — Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Brief had raised a million in seed funding from SignalFire and handful of angel investors, including Sequoia Scouts like David Lieb, Maia Bittner and Matt Macinnis.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#8217;s deal, Brief will wind down its subscription app on July 31. The company says it will alert its current user base today via a notification about its forthcoming shutdown but the app will remain on the App Store offering new features that allow users to explore its archives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is responding to user complaints and feedback about the controversial changes to the Safari mobile browser with today&#8217;s launch of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 beta 4. The new Safari design first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">introduced at WWDC</a> had moved the tab bar (URL bar) to the bottom of the screen &#8212; a fairly radical change for one of the iPhone&#8217;s most used apps. It was meant to make the controls easier to reach, if using a phone with one hand. But <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios">critics said</a> that the change made other often used features &#8212; like the reload button or Reader Mode &#8212; harder to find and use, impacting the overall usability of the mobile browser itself.</p>
<p>To Apple&#8217;s credit, it&#8217;s clearly been listening to the feedback.</p>
<p>In the pre-iOS 15 design, the tab bar sits in its traditional spot at the top of the screen, with an easy to access Reader Mode button (the double A&#8217;s) on the left and the reload button on the right. At the bottom, you&#8217;d find the forward and back buttons, a share button, reading list and tabs buttons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The iOS 15 design did away with all these useful access points to commonly used features, favoring the reachability of the tab bar over everything else. Instead, it used a three-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu to hide everything else that you may want to do when browsing the web &#8212; like reload the website, share a link, view the page in Reader Mode, save an article to read later, and so on. The list of actions that could be taken grew to over 20 items long, as a result.</p>
<p>On Apple pundit John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2021/07/21/ep-318">The Talk Show podcast</a>, he noted the new design wasn&#8217;t even popular inside Apple in the weeks leading up to the Safari announcement at WWDC. The internal sentiment among some was that the new design may look cool, but wasn&#8217;t all that usable, he claimed.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief Matthew Panzarino, who had joined as a guest on the July 21 episode, agreed that in theory, the idea of having less on the screen was a good idea. But in practice, it just didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you actually use it, you realize that it actually clutters the screen more and makes it a little more confusing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t give you much more screen real estate unless you take action &#8212; like scrolling &#8212; which makes it kind of weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the beta 4 update, Apple is trying to fix some of the issues that arose from this change in its new betas.</p>
<p>For starters, it has re-added a Share button to the tab bar and put additional controls under that menu. Sharing links is probably one of the most common tasks for web users, so it makes sense to put the button back in a place where it only takes one tap to use.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Refresh button is now permanently showing in the iOS 15 Safari address bar <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS15DevBeta4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOS15DevBeta4</a> <a href="https://t.co/v8AoRB68QI">pic.twitter.com/v8AoRB68QI</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also once again a reload button in the tab bar next to the domain name, though it&#8217;s a bit smaller compared with prior versions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Reader Mode button will appear in the tab bar when Reader is available, and it can be accessed with just one tap.</p>
<p>The tab bar will also now minimize when you&#8217;re interacting with buttons on websites. Before, it had gotten in the way, causing usability issues where website buttons remained unreachable.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just another day being unable to order takeout because iOS 15 Safari’s bottom bar makes this checkout button untappable.</p>
<p>thanks Safari for not letting me have that bruschetta <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f622.png" alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/e23YTYzGM6">pic.twitter.com/e23YTYzGM6</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>On iPadOS 15, users will notice tabs now appear on a standalone tab bar below the URL by default. The streamlined, compact tab bar that displays the URL and open tabs in one line &#8212; which was introduced in iPadOS 15 &#8212; can be enabled in Safari Settings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Apple isn&#8217;t the first to rethink the mobile browser design in this way.</p>
<p>A former Google Chrome design manager,<a href="https://twitter.com/cleerview/status/1419336516040544264"> Chris Lee</a>, <a href="https://read.cv/cleer/1R6eDCnOEDMDlRjMDbq8">recently wrote about his work</a> on a similar redesign for the Chrome mobile browser with a bottom URL bar that Google ultimately decided never to launch. He said the changes had also received mixed reactions at the time. The new design had gained a cult following in the tech community but mainstream users found the changes &#8220;disorienting,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>There is something to be said for the muscle memory with using an app that&#8217;s launched as frequently as Safari is. Although you may like the placement of the bar (I initially did!), over time, you may find that the changes made it more difficult when you wanted to do more than simply visit a website or swipe between tabs. And there&#8217;s a learning curve when it comes to remembering not to reach for the top of the screen for the shortcuts to various actions, too.</p>
<p>The Safari update is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/whats-new-in-ios-15-beta-4-safari-changes-focus-tweaks-and-more/">one of several tweaks arriving with the new beta releases</a>, which also include a way to share focus status with select contacts, a new XL widget size (which Apple Podcasts on iPad is using), and other, smaller updates.</p>

Out of all the early-stage startups ready to exhibit on September 21-23, Team TechCrunch hand-picked 50 to form the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Alley+</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cohort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Alley+ is a VIP experience designed to help founders grow their business and increase their opportunities right now in the run up to Disrupt.</span></p>
<p><b>Hold up:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don’t miss the opportunity to meet and network with all the innovative startups you’ll find in Startup Alley — including the Startup Alley+ cohort. Attend Disrupt for less than $100 — if you</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=danolsenpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=danolsenpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">buy your early-bird pass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before prices go up on </span><b>July 30 at 11:59 p.m. (PDT)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VIP experience includes three masterclass sessions on crucial topics that all startup founders need to, well, master. Case in point: product-market fit. It’s an elusive and yet essential first step to unlocking growth. You can’t build success without a product that quenches the demand of a thirsty market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 24, </span><a href="https://dan-olsen.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Olsen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will conduct a masterclass on the art and science of product-market fit. Olsen, a product management trainer and consultant, works with CEOs and product leaders to build strong product teams. His clients include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Box and Walmart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A best-selling author of</span> <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WUMFLr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lean Product Playbook </span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen has literally written the book on product-market fit. In his masterclass, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Create Product-Market Fit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Dan will draw on material in the book and share his simple but effective framework. He will explain his Product-Market Fit Pyramid and The Lean Product Process, a six-step methodology that guides you through how to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine your target customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify underserved customer needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define your value proposition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specify your MVP feature set.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your MVP prototype.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your MVP with customers.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan will illustrate these concepts with real-world examples and a comprehensive case study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re especially excited to have Dan present his masterclass because he’s firmly rooted in TechCrunch lore. Way back in 2009, a company called</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yourversion"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">YourVersion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — founded by Olsen —</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-yourversion-wins-peoples-choice-award-in-the-demopit/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">won the peoples’ choice at TechCrunch50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the precursor to Disrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen’s product-market fit expertise — and his personal connection to the early-stage founder experience — will help the Startup Alley+ cohort learn how to turn product management into more of a science than an art and improve their odds of success.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=danolsenpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=danolsenpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes place September 21-23.

<h2>The challenge: Delivery apps need more than speed to drive profitability</h2>
<p>To remain competitive, delivery apps are rethinking their services and broadening their offerings.</p>
<p>“Amazon powers next-day delivery,” Raj Beri, Uber’s global head of grocery and new verticals, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-doordash-and-uber-eats-the-future-is-everything-in-about-an-hour-11622453401">said</a> in May. “We’re going to power next-hour commerce.”</p>
<p>But speeding up the delivery process won’t necessarily drive revenue. More importantly, if your delivery service results in a poor customer experience, you’ll be less likely to win customer loyalty just because you offer faster delivery.</p>
<p>The primary challenge faced by delivery apps, or any e-commerce company looking to add delivery services as part of its offerings, is building a foundation that enables not only speed and convenience for the customer, but one that takes into account all aspects of the customer experience. For example, when delivering food, the business responsible for the delivery must make sure the food is handled safely and remain free of any contaminants. The temperature — whether hot or cold — must be maintained throughout the delivery process and the order itself must be correct.</p>
<h2>The solution: Same-day delivery relies on sophisticated technology platforms</h2>
<p>The “Uberization” of everything, combined with dramatically elevated consumer expectations, will take much more than a delivery app and fleet of drivers for businesses to be profitable. To follow through on the promise of same-day delivery services, a number of things need to happen without any missteps between when an order is placed and when it shows up at the customer’s door. The more complex the product being delivered, the more difficult the delivery process becomes.</p>
<p>To enable same-day delivery services while also reaching profitability, a delivery app must take into account the technology needed to meet customer expectations. It involves much more than simply designing an app and growing user numbers. A truly successful same-day delivery model that provides an exceptional customer experience relies on a sophisticated software platform that can simultaneously manage various aspects of the customer journey, all while making it appear seamless from the customer’s point of view.</p>
<p>Profitable delivery services are built on automated systems powered by artificial intelligence systems and robotics. The technology must come first, before the app and before user growth. Any other delivery business model is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Domino’s Pizza is a brand that has perfected the delivery process and vastly improved the overall customer experience by making technology core to their business model. The key moment came when the brand defined itself as an e-commerce company that sells pizza. It committed to data applications and implemented a robotics technology platform that enabled electronic delivery systems that added speed and efficiency to the delivery process. In April, Domino’s began rolling out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">robot car delivery service</a> to select customers in Houston via Nuro.</p>
<p>GrubHub is also taking steps to integrate robotic capabilities into its delivery process. According to recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/yandex-self-driving-group-partners-with-grubhub-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-college-campuses/">reports</a>, the company announced it would be adding self-driving units that deploy drone-like robots to deliver food to college students. The program, which will roll out on a limited number of U.S. college campuses this fall, aims to reduce delivery times and, hopefully, costs.</p>
<p>This focus on technology is crucial in the world of delivery apps, or for any businesses forced to compete in the newly emerging category of next-hour commerce. The key to building a successful, profitable business model is to invest in technology platforms that can connect all components of the customer journey, from opening an app and clicking on a product to purchasing the product and scheduling the delivery, and beyond.</p>
<h2>Same-day delivery: Where to go from here</h2>
<p>In a world where everyone wants to open an app on their phone and have whatever it is they need to be delivered within an hour, it’s tempting for business leaders to focus on the delivery app itself, whether they are building their own or partnering with another company. But focusing on the app is a shortsighted view of same-day delivery models.</p>
<p>Instead, business leaders must use a wide-angle lens and consider every single aspect of their customer journey: How do customers engage with their business? How do customers search for and find the products they offer? What does it take to complete an order and what conditions must be met before the order can be delivered? Also, what happens after the order to ensure it went smoothly and to the customer’s satisfaction?</p>
<p>Some businesses are finding success partnering with delivery apps, but this comes with the risk of putting your brand’s reputation in the hands of another company that acts as a frontline employee with customers. Other companies are adding delivery service options to their current e-commerce model, relying on third-party software that can be plugged into an existing technology stack. Unfortunately, this comes with limitations and is not viable for regulated businesses that include multiple components.</p>
<p>The only way to ensure a seamless customer experience on top of same-day delivery services is to build a proprietary software platform that puts the technology at the heart of your business, which allows you to automate key processes, adding speed and convenience to your delivery model. It also makes it possible to integrate robotic systems that can expedite orders, include artificial intelligence protocols that can accelerate business growth, and scale your delivery model as your business expands.</p>
<h2>Thriving in the new era of e-commerce</h2>
<p>“Next-hour delivery” is a catchy tagline that is sure to gain traction among consumers, but whether it will help drive profitability remains to be seen. As the CEO of a firm that has built a profitable business model centered on <a href="http://www.nowrx.com">same-day delivery services</a>, I’m skeptical that the promise of next-hour delivery will drive more revenue if the technology powering the delivery systems lacks automation, artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>
<p>It’s true that businesses will be forced to compete on same-day delivery. But another truth that has emerged since the pandemic is that this new era of e-commerce comes with heightened customer expectations that won’t be met on speed alone. Consumer satisfaction hinges on more than the amount of time it takes to move an order from an app to the customer’s door.</p>
<p>To succeed in the delivery service market, business leaders must ask themselves a number of questions: Which parts of their business are needed to complete a same-day delivery order? Is the ordering process intuitive? Can the order and delivery be monitored by the customer? Is the order correct when it arrives? Does it meet the customer’s expectations?</p>
<p>And, most importantly, is their business built on a technology platform that can support the entire customer journey and delivery model, from product discovery and purchase to same-day delivery and beyond? The businesses that answer yes to these questions are the ones I expect to thrive in the post-pandemic world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anadalakra/">Anada Lakra</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyausorov/"> Ilya Usorov</a> first moved to the United States, they struggled to find their voices. They both knew and understood English, but when it came time to speak up, their accents became a hurdle. Usorov, for example, watched his Russian-born parents struggle to advocate for themselves, which limited work opportunities. While Lakra, who just started college at Yale University, was constantly asked to repeat herself.</p>
<p>“Will I be able to express myself clearly enough? Will I be understood? Will I be as impactful?” Lakra remembers questioning herself. “My accent pronunciation made me feel like I really wasn’t my full self &#8212; and I lost a little of my personality.”</p>
<p>It’s an issue experienced, to varying degrees, by many of the roughly 65 million nonnative English speakers in the United States. Viewing accent as a hurdle in jobs, confidence and relationship-building, the duo teamed up as co-founders to build a solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, Lakra and Usorov are launching <a href="https://www.boldvoice.com/">BoldVoice</a>, an accent coaching app that helps users refine their pronunciation of the English language. The New York-based startup, currently going through Y Combinator’s summer 2021 batch, raised a pre-seed round of about $605,000 from the accelerator and XFund.</p>
<h2>Hollywood, meet edtech</h2>
<p>BoldVoice has a very specific user in mind: nonnative English speakers who learned the language on paper but now need help speaking and interacting with people.</p>
<p>The startup uses short-form videos, taught by Hollywood accent coaches who traditionally help actors, to deliver content. The curriculum is built around three Ps: posture, to help with the physical feel of using an English R versus a Spanish R; phonology, the vowels and consonants; and porosity, which is the musicality of an accent. So far, there are two Hollywood accent and dialect coaches on the platform: <a href="https://www.roncarlos.com/">Ron Carlos</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dialectsnow?lang=en">Eliza Simpson.</a></p>
<p>“We’re really thinking about this in the same way that an actor will learn an accent for a new role,” where they have to pick it up very quickly, Lakra said. “We want to bring the same discipline and process to everyone at home, so we have Hollywood accent coaches who are trained voice speech and dialect coaches” as well as advisers who have degrees in linguistics.</p>
<p>Beyond its short-form videos, the company plans to integrate artificial intelligence into its product. When a user practices a speech, BoldVoice records the speech sample, feeds it into an algorithm and, over time, will be able to recommend more tailored exercises to their weak areas. It is using open-source software currently but is developing its own AI algorithm for the future. Real-time feedback would be a feat.</p>

<p>The sign-in process is pretty simple. Users are asked to set goals around accent confidence, explain English proficiency and identify native language, as well as the situation in which they want to improve, which can range from in the workplace to social settings. Users are also asked to commit pronunciation practice for 10 minutes a day, with the option to say no.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182662" style="width: 383px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182662" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2182662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png" alt="" width="373" height="823" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png 718w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png?resize=68,150 68w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png?resize=136,300 136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png?resize=308,680 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png?resize=696,1536 696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-10.43.09-AM.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BoldVoice/TechCrunch screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>They are then given a lesson plan, which is only accessible through a subscription. The company charges $10 a month or $70 a year, which is meant to be more accessible than private accent coach tutoring, which can hit $200 per hour. There is currently no free experience for BoldVoice beyond a one-week free trial.</p>
<p>After launching a little over a month ago, BoldVoice has attracted 1,000 users, most of whom come from India, China, or are Spanish speakers. The company is focusing on creating “hyper-personalized” content around these core users, and will have its work cut out for it: There are <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/more-than-19500-mother-tongues-spoken-in-india-census-5241056/">121 languages</a> spoken by more than 10,000 people in India, with the Indian constitution<a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/what-languages-are-spoken-in-india#:~:text=The%20Indian%20constitution%20recognizes%2022,%2C%20Malayalam%2C%20Konkani%20and%20Kashmiri."> officially recognizing 22 languages. </a></p>
<h2><strong>The owl is watching</strong></h2>
<p>BoldVoice is looking to dig into the crowded market of language learning startups at a key time for the edtech subsector. Language learning unicorn Duolingo is set to go public this week, which could cast a golden halo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">on other consumer edtech businesses</a>. The company has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">raised its expected price range</a> ahead of its public offering, a confident move. Other companies such as Busuu and Babbel have also made progress in carving out spheres of language learning.</p>
<p>But Lakra doesn’t think any existing language learning apps have won over the accent market yet. She explained how learning a language is about memorization of vocabulary and grammar, while learning an accent is about working out your mouth through tongue exercises. The latter, which BoldVoice focuses on, doesn’t yet seem to be a priority for other businesses.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not wrong. Duolingo excels at reading and writing literacy, but it has not yet shared any known efficacy studies about its pronunciation efforts. The company tried launching a chatbot in its early days to help users practice conversations. The highly requested feature flopped, though, as 80% of users didn’t use it &#8212; a reaction that CEO Luis von Ahn thinks underscores how difficult it is to get consumers to practice speaking.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="46KhidNZEO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/embed/#?secret=46KhidNZEO" data-secret="46KhidNZEO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Duolingo is now building investment in a team around speech recognition technology, as well as eyeing M&amp;A opportunities. BoldVoice, which similarly uses bite-sized content and streaks, could bring its product of confidence to Duolingo’s mission of motivation.</p>
<p>Beyond the complementary yet competitive landscape, BoldVoice’s challenge ahead may just be that it is playing in a sensitive area. Someone’s voice is an integral part of their identity. BoldVoice will need to balance helping people, while also not erasing what makes them <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Lakra thinks that they can strike the balance. Her perception of the user is constantly evolving.</p>
<p>“Users are already telling us that it would be awesome to get more tips around public speaking or how to interject in a meeting or how to give feedback politely,” she said. The requests are all about how to culturally and linguistically use English in a professional English-speaking environment, and BoldVoice is working with coaches to create content beyond pronunciation and into cadence, projection and intonation.</p>
<p>“We definitely want to move and make this a tool that helps people not just say the word the right way, but just feel confident in everything they say.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">From day one, Pillar VC has offered to buy common stock in startups.</p>
<p>Instead of the standard 10-page venture capital term sheet riddled with terms and conditions, our team believed that a far simpler structure where we owned the same security as the founders would align interests, increase trust, and hopefully, enhance the performance of our investments.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There are many terms and conditions in a preferred term sheet that can misalign investors and founders					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Five years since launching Pillar, as we finish investing our second fund and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pillar-vc-closes-192m-for-two-funds-targeting-saas-crypto-biotech-manufacturing/">begin deploying our third</a>, we thought it was a good time to reflect on whether buying common stock instead of preferred stock has offered the benefits that we had hoped for.</p>
<h2>Preferred stock can misalign incentives between parties</h2>
<p>There are many terms and conditions in a preferred term sheet that can misalign investors and founders — for brevity, I’ll highlight just two below. (For more, see the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/introducing-the-term-sheet-grader/">term-sheet grader</a>).</p>
<p><b>Preference</b><strong>:</strong> Preferred stock has a &#8220;preference&#8221; that gives the investor the right to choose whether they want to get their money back or take their percentage of the total proceeds. In downside scenarios, having an investor take their money back may mean that they are taking a far higher percentage of the proceeds than the founders &#8220;thought&#8221; they sold.</p>
<p>For example, if an investor buys 25% of a company for $2 million in preferred stock, their break point on this decision will be $8 million, which happens to be the post-money valuation of the round. If the company is sold for less than $8 million, the investor would rather take their $2 million back. If the company is sold for more than that, the investor would choose to take 25% of the total.</p>
<p>The founder thinks that they sold 25% of their company, but that percentage is actually determined by what the company is sold for. Yes, if the company is sold for $8 million or more, they sold 25%, but if the company is sold for, say $4 million, the investors will choose to take their $2 million back, which is 50% of the proceeds. Worse still, if the company is sold for just $2 million, investors will take all of it.</p>
<p><b>Anti-dilution</b><strong>:</strong> This clause means that if an investor buys shares for $10 and the startup raises money in the future at a price point that is lower than $10, the investor’s share price will be recalculated retroactively to a lower price. How is this done? By issuing the investors more shares, which dilutes the rest of the ownership pie, especially the founders and employees. The company is not performing well and the investors are made whole at the expense of the founders. Aligned? Hardly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monte Carlo&#8217;s Barr Moses joins the data panel at TC Sessions: SaaS 2021. See you there!</p>
<p>As the clock ticks down on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=barrmosesspeaekerpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=barrmosesspeaekerpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch&#8217;s upcoming SaaS-focused event</a>, we&#8217;re excited to announce that <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a> co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/bm_datadowntime?lang=en">Barr Moses</a> will join us. Specifically, the startup exec will be joining our data-focused panel.</p>
<p>What does Monte Carlo do? The startup works in the realm of data observability, making sure that companies&#8217; data ingestion work is bringing in actual information, and not bunk.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/monte-carlo-raises-25m-for-its-data-observability-service/">covered Monte Carlo&#8217;s Series B earlier this year</a>, Moses was kind enough to walk me through her company&#8217;s market. Which makes her a perfect fit for our data-focused panel.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re past the era in which saying &#8220;Big Data&#8221; could get you onto a stage. Today&#8217;s data gurus are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/databricks-brings-its-lakehouse-to-google-cloud/">building lakehouses</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">going public</a> for their work with hybrid structured-and-unstructured database tech. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo wants to make sure that companies around the world are alerted when some of their incoming data pipelines go off the rails. That way when the corporate world does run data analysis on their collected information, it isn&#8217;t skewed by zeroes and other effluent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big enough problem, and a hot enough market, that Monte Carlo raised its Series A in September of 2020, and its Series B mere months later in February of 2021. That&#8217;s a rapid-fire pace of capital accumulation; investors are betting that Moses and her team are onto something pretty big. Notably, TechCrunch also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand/">published an article the other month</a> that included an interview with her co-founder, Yotam Hadass.</p>
<p>Moses will join other tech folks at the event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/javier-soltero-googles-head-of-workspace-will-join-us-at-tc-sessions-saas/">including Javier Soltero, Google&#8217;s head of Workspace</a>. Who else is coming? Databricks&#8217; Ali Ghodsi, UiPath&#8217;s Daniel Dines, Puppet&#8217;s Abby Kearns, and investors Casey Aylward and Sarah Guo, among others. It&#8217;s going to be nerdy and kickass.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Startups across Africa have never had more access to capital than they do right now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange is on a trip around the world, poking our heads into various startup markets to better understand how different geographies are faring during a historic boom in venture capital activity. Globally, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">venture capital world is afire</a>, pushing record sums into upstart technology companies. But the capital is not flowing evenly.</p>
<p>For example, the explosion in capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">raised by U.S. startups this year</a> is contrasted by a modestly cooling Chinese venture capital scene. But apart from China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">most key startup</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">countries and regions</a> are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/canadas-startup-market-booms-alongside-hot-global-vc-investment/">seeing strong investor interest</a>. The continent of Africa is no exception.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Early data indicates that Africa is set to trounce historical records in terms of venture capital raised in the year and that the first half of 2021 saw roughly twice the funds raised by African startups as was recorded in the first half of 2020. Startups across Africa have never had more access to capital than they do right now.</p>
<p>But big numbers can be distorting. A few outsized rounds can make an overall investment picture appear rosier than it may actually be for startups on the ground. To fully understand a startup market’s capital access, we’ll want to better understand the stages where capital is flowing quickly and the points of startup life where it’s more of a trickle.</p>

<p>Let’s figure out which startup stages have the easiest and hardest capital access, whether Africa remains underfunded, understand changing diversity in founder funding, and just what’s up with impressive fintech venture totals in recent quarters.</p>
<h2>A 2021 comeback</h2>
<p>After a somewhat difficult 2020, venture capital flowing into African startups is back on the rise, with reports indicating that investments raised in the first half of 2021 totaled more than $1 billion, albeit with small variations — data discrepancies are a recurring issue when it comes to VC data. There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">structural reasons for slightly divergent numbers</a> that have not completely disappeared, but our different sources still concur on the general trend and ballpark results.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/">Africa-focused Substack newsletter The Big Deal</a> reported a $1.14 billion H1 2021 total for deals above $1 million and $1.19 billion when including deals in the $100,000 to $1 million range. Those numbers coincide with Briter Bridges&#8217; own count of $1.2 billion in disclosed funding between January and June 2021, and with a $1.03 billion estimate from the Global Private Capital Association (GPCA). These figures are also in line with 2021 predictions from tech accelerator AfricArena, which in a <a href="https://f1d0651a-c40a-4877-b5d5-7f6204467ba9.filesusr.com/ugd/cdd60c_5d9debf5822c4e84940b69925d8d2ba2.pdf">report earlier this year</a> estimated that &#8220;investment into [African] tech startups will be between $2.25 and $2.8 billion, making it the best year in the history of tech investment on the continent.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Haven&#8217;t you heard that Instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/">no longer a photo-sharing app</a>? Today, Instagram announced that users can now upload 60-second videos on Reels, the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">TikTok competitor</a>.</p>
<p>This update also adds functionality for a captions sticker on Reels, which transcribes audio to text. Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/instagram-adds-a-captions-option-for-stories-and-soon-reels/">previously teased</a> this sticker for Reels when they added it to Stories, making the platform more accessible for deaf or hard-of-hearing users, as well as people who want to use the app without sound. Right now, the caption sticker is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, but Instagram says they plan to expand to additional countries and languages soon. TikTok already has a similar feature.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Previously, Instagram only supported Reels of up to 30 seconds, while TikTok recently made it possible for users to create videos up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">three minutes long</a>. Still, the ability to post 60-second Reels is especially useful for creators who want to repost their existing content from TikTok or other competitor apps to grow their following across multiple platforms. More creators are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/a-bank-for-the-creator-economy-karat-raises-26m-in-series-a-funding/">making a living on social media</a> than ever, but with so many platforms available to them (even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">Pinterest is investing</a> in short-form video), it&#8217;s smart to cross-post content. So, this feature benefits Instagram creators who also have a following on TikTok, but it makes sense for the platform itself as well &#8212; the more eyes on Reels, the better. Instagram&#8217;s algorithm doesn&#8217;t promote content with a TikTok watermark, but savvy users have figured out how to recycle their videos without it.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">YouTube Shorts</a> and Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a> also support videos of up to 60 seconds. In May, YouTube Shorts launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">$100 million creator fund</a> to distribute among top Shorts creators over the course of 2021 and 2022; Snapchat distributed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">$1 million per day</a> to viral Spotlight creators between its launch at the end of November through the end of 2020. Facebook and Instagram have also committed to <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/investing-in-content-creators-facebook-instagram">investing in digital creators</a>.</p>
<p>To access this feature, navigate to create a new Reel, then press the down button on the left side of the screen to reveal the menu. Tap &#8220;length&#8221; to toggle among options to create a 15-second, 30-second or 60-second Reel. Not all creators have access to 60-second Reels just yet, but it should roll out to all users soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify has made it possible for eligible sellers to sell NFTs (non-fungible tokens) via its platform, which opens up a whole new world for e-commerce merchants.</p>
<p>On Monday, the NBA’s Chicago Bulls launched its first-ever NFTs –– including digital artwork of NBA championship rings –– by launching an<a href="https://nft.bulls.com/"> online store on Shopify</a>. Instead of having to go to an NFT marketplace, Bulls fans can now purchase the digital art directly with the team’s online store using a credit or debit card. In its first day of making them available, the NBA team sold out of the NFTs within just 90 seconds, according to Kaz Nejatian, Shopify’s VP of merchant services.</p>
<p>“You could buy NFTs on credit cards before, but honestly the NFT buying experience outside Shopify isn’t awesome for anyone right now,” he told TechCrunch “That’s why we decided to do this work. Merchants and buyers shouldn’t have to take a course in crypto to buy things they care about.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also about giving consumers more options to buy NFTs – especially those who are not well-versed in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By making it possible for merchants to sell NFTs directly through their Shopify storefronts, the company says it’s creating access for merchants who want to sell NFTs. They will eventually be able to choose which blockchain they’d like to sell on based on their products and customer base since Shopify supports multiple blockchains, Nejatian said.</p>
<p>“By contrast, if merchants want to sell on an NFT marketplace, they need to choose based on the blockchain supported by that marketplace,” he added.</p>
<p>The Chicago Bulls selected the Flow blockchain for their NFTs, for example. But overall, Shopify merchants can today choose from Flow and Ethereum, but soon &#8220;will have more choice with other blockchains on Shopify,&#8221; according to Nejatian.</p>
<p>The move was also driven by demand from merchants asking for the ability to sell NFTs and the desire to give creators and artists another forum to grow professionally.</p>
<p>“Many creators are already seeing the value of selling NFTs to their fans, but we’re removing some of the friction for themselves and their buyers, allowing them to better monetize their work and their connection to their audience,” he added. “We’re opening up a world where their fans feel meaningful connection to their brands, and where NFTs just increasingly become part of how we buy and sell online.&#8221;</p>
